      "value": "We loved from BJOOKS, which is a beautiful coffee table book that takes a wonderful look at a wide range of historic keyboards and synths, so it was with great enthusiasm that we received by Kim Bjorn. Given that Roland is celebrating 50 years of existence this year, it is not entirely surprising that some type of Roland commemorative book was written. Having the fantastic publishers at BJOOKS produce such a tome was merely icing on top of the cake. What was surprising to this editor, however, is how much more than just a colorful coffee table book, , actually is. The nearly 400-page book is divided into sections: Groove, Drums, Guitar, Keys, Synth, Studio, and History (of the company itself). \u00a0Each section is then divided into multiple chapters, which generally go in chronological order of the first instrument in that genre, and moving through time with each new historical gear addition, arriving to present day. While there are many fantastic photos of Roland gear throughout the book, there\u2019s a lot of great stuff you\u2019ll discover if you actually READ it! There are explanations of not only how an individual instrument worked, but also what its significance to music making in general was. Many of Roland\u2019s instruments were trendsetters in various ways and across various genres of music, and that is all captured here. Some of us at MusicPlayers.com are old enough to know when these instruments were new and all of these things were happening (yes, this editor bought his Roland Juno-106 new in early 1986), but both older and younger musicians will enjoy reading about the impact and evolution of both Roland instruments and music in general. Another great feature throughout the book are the various interviews. There are over 90 interviews with artists, DJs and producers including: Thomas Dolby, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Ali Stone, Omar Hakim, Sister Bliss, Howard Jones, Orbital, Richie Hawtin, Peaches, Culture Club producer Steve Levine, Guy Fletcher of Dire Straits, Clive Deamer of Radiohead, Ginger Shankar, Swizz Beatz, Rachel Z, Nick Rhodes and Roger Taylor of Duran Duran, Nita Strauss, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Steve Stevens, Johnny Marr of The Smiths, Buffy Sainte- Marie, electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre, Yana Reznik, Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter of the Doobie Brothers, Rance Dopson, Bonnie McIntosh, Egyptian Lover and quite a few others. One final aspect we especially enjoyed was the interspersed tidbits of \u201cHow did they do that?\u201d For example, did you know that Phil Collins\u2019 \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d drum beat (prior to the famous drum fill) was a Roland CR-78, set to preset Disco 2A, very slowed down, with gated reverb and compression? We didn\u2019t either! There\u2019s quite a bit of \u201cwho was using what\u201d as you go through the book, and that was cool to read about. All in all, this is a wonderful encapsulation of Roland\u2019s first fifty years. Even better, it\u2019s not just glorifying Roland products, but it puts them into context with specific artists and their impact on music in general. Whether you play Roland and BOSS gear or just love music in general, you should find plenty of interesting and entertaining information on tap within these pages. And it makes an excellent holiday gift, too! BJOOOKS https://www.bjooks.com"

      "value": "Here we are\u2026 again! Yamaha has received a lot of attention for their flagship Montage synthesizer since we first reviewed it in 2016. . Then, earlier in 2019 we reviewed the Montage . Not ones to sit around, Yamaha continues to update and improve the Montage, bring us to the latest OS update, now at version 3.0. To quote Yamaha, the 3.0 release offers: \u2022 New effect types have been added. \u2022 New Performances have been added. \u2022 The Pattern Sequencer function has been added. \u2022 The Rhythm Pattern function has been added. \u2022 You can now play songs, patterns and audio files from the Live Set display. \u2022 Super Knob Link has been added to the data that is recorded in the Scene function. \u2022 Keyboard Control has been added to the data that is recorded in the Scene function. \u2022 Increased the range of the LFO Speed parameter. \u2022 You can now connect MIDI equipment via the USB TO DEVICE terminal. \u2022 The Global Micro Tuning settings have been added. \u2022 The Audition Loop setting has been added. \u2022 Improvements have been made to the user interface. \u2022 The Note capacity (total area in Store) has been increased from 130,000 to 520,000 (for Songs) and 520,000 (for Patterns). While it sounds trivial at first, the expanded range of the LFO opens up new sonic possibilities. You can go really slow, making the sounds very organic and analog sounding, or really fast, making sounds sound very industrial or insect-like (if that\u2019s your thing). This extended range is actually switchable, so you don\u2019t always have to use it. The effects Yamaha are referring to are Virtual Circuit Modelling (VCM) Mini Filter and Mini Booster respectively. The VCM Mini Filter is a classic four-pole 24 dB/octave filter, perhaps made most famous (and certainly often copied!) by Moog synthesizers. The Cutoff, Resonance, Dry/Wet mix, Input Level and Output Level can all be assigned to a Motion Sequence, the Envelope Follower or actual physical controls (Super Knob, Assignable Knobs, Modulation Wheel). There are several presets to get you started, labelled 1970s LPF, 1980s LPF, modern LPF, and so on, and presets for HPF as well. You can also pick a texture type from retro, standard, and modern, generally getting brighter sound as you \u201cmove through time,\u201d so to speak. The Mini Booster\u2019s parameter settings are similar, with retro/standard/modern setting as well as 70s/80s and modern Boost presets. The Wave Folder effect is interesting. Instead of clipping, which removes the top part of a given wave that exceeds the peak value accepted, the Wave Folder effect \u201cfolds\u201d those previously clipped peaks under the threshold line, resulting in an increase in harmonic content. There are 52 new performances, representing new sound additions to both the Montage and MODX. This brings the onboard content total to 2,707 Performances. One of the more notable new features is a Pattern Sequencer. Essentially, this adds multitrack, loop-based sequence recording to the Performance Recorder. This can get quite complex, as each pattern has up to eight Sections and each Section has up to 16 Tracks. Sections are selected by using the Scene buttons on both the Montage and MODX. Players who create music using loops will have quite an arsenal of possibilities at their disposal. Yamaha explains it as below: A nice feature is that each track can vary in length, up to 256 measures. Each track can even have its own time signature. Wow! In addition, the \u201cPlayFX\u201d allows for quantization, note, clock, velocity, and swing adjustments in a non-destructive way, allowing the track feel to be adjusted as you see fit. Changes are committed only after you press the \u201cnormalize PlayFX\u201d button. Also on the subject of patterns, adding a rhythm pattern (i.e., a drum part with arpeggio) to a performance has been introduced to the Montage (it previously existed in the MODX). Hold [SHIFT] and then press [CONTROL ASSIGN] and the Rhythm Pattern screen appears for you to select a drum kit along with a corresponding drum arpeggio. This is a great way to quickly add a backing track to your music. The new USB MIDI Host function is pretty cool. It enables you to play the internal MONTAGE sounds directly from a class-compliant USB MIDI controller without a computer. There is also increased MIDI choices within the OS, in the form of \u201cHybrid MIDI I/O mode\u201d. In Hybrid MIDI I/O mode, you can separate the Parts you want to play and control locally from the Parts you want to control remotely. Overall, we think the updates are welcome additions, and will be most useful in the studio for sound sculpting and loop creation, though banks of new sounds are always welcome regardless of your specific need. Still, our previously-asked question remains: can Yamaha design a CS-80 emulation be put into the Montage? Now that would be something! Yamaha usa.yamaha.com"

      "value": "Yamaha has gotten a lot of attention for their flagship Montage synth since its release, and deservedly so. We first checked it out in 2016, twice, as it underwent an early OS upgrade. . Now the OS is updated to version 2.5, and more are planned for the future. So, what\u2019s new? Quite a bit, as it turns out. The new OS brings all of the original MOTIF XF Performances to the preset collection, increasing the total number of performance presets to nearly 2,700. This is like getting a whole new synth inside the one you already have, in this case that new instrument being a Motif under the control of the Montage\u2019s formidable live controls\u2014including the Super Knob. While OS version 2.0 allowed the importation of Motif-XS/XF and MOXF performance, these were not adapted to the Montage Motion Control synthesis engine. Now they are! Interestingly, they were added to the end of the existing presets (so it won\u2019t confuse your existing setup), and they are arranged in the same order they were on the original synths. One interesting new feature is DAW Remote mode. This mode lets you control Steinberg Cubase, Apple Logic Pro, Ableton Live and Avid Pro Tools directly from the MONTAGE hardware and on-screen controls. Beyond the feature\u2019s transport and mixer control, it is now also possible to select, arm, mute and solo DAW tracks as well as edit plug-ins all from the MONTAGE front panel. There are several settings to change to make this work properly, which in our case was running Pro Tools on a Mac. Yamaha has a nice tutorial for setup . To make this work, you need to install the latest Yamaha USB driver, and on the Montage, in the lower left corner of the screen is a new button called \u201cRemote\u201d. Once pressed, you can select your DAW directly: Then, you can go to the control panels, and assign to your heart\u2019s content- like this: You can transmit across up to eight MIDI channels simultaneously, and you can even specify arpeggiations to be sent as well (not just the initial notes pressed to start them). Waveform tools have also been added, including some helpful ones including \u201cKeyboard Select\u201d and \u201cCenter Note\u201d functions, which allow you to quickly assign an audio file to a key, and to match the keyboard note to the original pitch of the waveform. Not everyone may be importing sounds, but for those who do, little things like this can certainly save time. Another interesting feature is the ability to lock the front panel. Presumably aimed at live use, you can lock the controls so settings can\u2019t be changed accidentally (or nefariously, depending on the extreme gigging situations you might find yourself in). OS 2.5 also brings about some minor under-the-hood bug fixes that may or may not make a difference in your existing use of the keyboard. Overall, we were really impressed by the latest system update. It\u2019s completely free, so install this one immediately. The feature updates are really useful in the studio, and the massive Motif XF expansion alone is simply fabulous. Our only question is this: can Yamaha design a CS-80 emulation be put into the Montage? Now that would be something! Yamaha www.usa.yamaha.com"

      "value": "Ernie Ball has been making a wide range of accessories for guitars and basses for decades, but many of the products are easily overlooked by \u201cserious\u201d musicians who are quick to ignore products that are sold by companies perceived to be one of \u201cthe big guys\u201d in favor of products from more boutique-ish companies. Sure, many of you string your instruments with Slinkys and a number of you have Ernie Ball volume/expression pedals in your rigs, but as it turns out, Ernie Ball makes a wide range of other accessories that are easily overlooked, but shouldn\u2019t be. We recently had a chance to use a wide variety of Ernie Ball accessories and formulate some opinions of the range of products as a whole. From the spectacular, award-winning Music Man guitars down to instrument cables, replacement guitar parts/hardware, and beyond, it\u2019s clear that this company puts a lot of thought into the range of accessories they offer\u2014and the of those accessories. In no particular order, here are some highlights worthy of your immediate consideration: Writing about strings is a topic that can spawn endless commentary\u2014and endless subsequent debate. But it\u2019s safe to assume that as a MusicPlayers.com reader, you\u2019ve either used Ernie Ball Slinky strings (or Super Slinky, etc.) or you know someone who does. They are time tested, tried and true, and today come in a wide variety of gauges. We recently got our hands on some Ultra Slinky Custom Gauge and Burly Slinky Custom Gauge strings that are designed to accommodate players with a love for dropped tunings. These strings are similar to equivalent packs of standard strings but with (3) heavier bass strings in the set for a more solid response when dropping the tuning. It\u2019s a subtle difference that may really improve your tone (and intonation) on drop-tuned guitars. Did you know there are actually guitar picks made by someone other than Jim Dunlop? Well, if you\u2019re a fan of Tortex-style picks, you\u2019ll be right at home with the Ernie Ball Everlast Guitar Picks. They are the same size as their obvious competitor and feel like they are made from a similar satin/chalky material. Unlike the cute looking turtle, these picks are adorned with a more sinister bird of prey d\u00e9cor, and they come in a wide range of gauges. Don\u2019t go by color, though\u2014the EB color scheme is not the same as Dunlop\u2019s. We love Ernie Ball\u2019s brighter pastel colors, and they have the same feel we\u2019re accustomed to playing with. This is one of those very picky product categories. Our friends are happy to debate the merits of premium instrument cables, and we know too many players who will not play a \u201ccommon brand\u201d instrument cable, assuming that it\u2019s inferior to their boutique cable that cost 4-6x as much. We\u2019ve spent the past two months playing with braided Ernie Ball Instrument Cables (which we prefer over non-braided cables as they don\u2019t tangle very easily by comparison). These dual-shielded cables are 99.95% oxygen-free copper and have extremely durable, nickel instrument connectors with strain relief at each end\u2014one straight and one right angle. They sound as good as any other cables we\u2019ve been using in our guitar rigs, and yes, we\u2019re picky. The lifetime warranty should add further confidence that these cables are a safe bet. We\u2019re big fans of the neon color options, too. Viva le \u201880s! If your choice of guitar strap is dictated by comfort, we have to talk about Ernie Ball Polyspun straps. They don\u2019t scream rock n\u2019 roll from the braided look, but these polyester, woven straps have a natural give that makes them very comfortable\u2014like wearing an old glove, and the leather ends are soft enough that attaching to our guitars is never a challenge. We also tried the Neoprene Polylock Comfort Strap and while we love the springy feel of a neoprene strap, we just can\u2019t get behind the PolyLock ends. Yes, they\u2019ll grip the hell out of your bass or guitar, but we fear that if you constantly remove your straps in order to fit the instruments in their cases, you\u2019re going to wear down the strength of the strap pegs, which could lead to unforeseen accidents. Please, Ernie Ball, give us this luxuriously comfy strap with your standard strap ends! Unless all of your guitars have locking tuners, you need the Ernie Ball Power Peg or Power Peg Pro string winders. This hand-held, battery-powered device makes a breeze out of string changes and string winding around your tuning pegs, and should be considered a . The non-abrasive head adapts to virtually all sized tuning pegs (the new Pro model accommodates larger tuning pegs as found on some basses and acoustic instruments). The string winder is pretty much unrivaled and is one of those items you need to have in your guitar maintenance kit. Players constantly ask each other for advice on the topic of instrument care. When it\u2019s time to go beyond a damp, soft cotton or microfiber cloth, we have been turning to Ernie Ball Wonder Wipes for more than a decade now. There is string cleaner, a fretboard conditioner that we particularly love (it\u2019s a blend of oranage, jojoba, and linseed oild), as well as instrument polish. Ernie Ball"

      "value": "50 years is a LONG time for any musical product to remain in production, much less relevant. Ampeg is celebrating a well deserved 50th anniversary of the SVT line with a special . Splitting the two channels across their best, historic tones, the first channel faithfully recreates the amp that started it all, the 1969 SVT. The second channel sounds closer to the \u201870s SVT amp. Coming in at a staggering 300 tube-driven watts, we are convinced Ampeg will be celebrating many more milestones with the SVT line. Quite comically, outside of the Ampeg room in the Marriot was a gigantic, eleven foot tall SVT bass rig! We are fairly certain this amp had enough SPL to launch a player all the way back to the convention center in the adjacent building. And yes, Harry Shearer (oops, we mean Derek Smalls, of course) was on hand to demonstrate the amp. \u2014BS No more excuses for wanting some fantastic EBS tone in your bass rig. EBS just introduced the dual-channel bass preamp pedal. It boasts plenty of headroom at +/-15V, and you can run its Clean and Drive channels in series or parallel. There are dual XLR outputs, a stereo effects loop, on-board tuner and compressor, headphone output, and more. It\u2019s easily one of the nicest bass preamp pedals we\u2019ve seen. \u2014SK The is a fascinating new product, enabling bassists using in-ear monitoring to really feel their bass while performing. With a speaker out from the bass amp, the bassist physically stands on a subwoofer platform which sends sub bass frequencies to the bassists feet, allowing the player to feel his/her bass, even if you can\u2019t hear it well because of IEMs or a horrible stage monitor mix. We tried it for ourselves and it really adds a great dynamic between the instrument and the player. Caution: do not stand on this board with loose fillings! \u2014BS Ibanez always has a ton of great instruments on display, but what immediately caught our eyes was a spectacular instrument that breaks from classic Ibanez styling. Ibanez reintroduced the Affirma series of instruments, featuring the spectacular , which is already in our studio for review! This series was originally introduced in the early \u201890s, designed by Swiss luthier, Rolf Spuler. The streamlined and sculped body is luxuriously light in weight, with a maple body (walnut top), Bartolini X55JX pickup, and AeroSilk MR5 bridge with Piezo acoustic elements that are blended with the magnetic output to your liking. And oh yes, do we like this! For the more dextrous among you, we found ourselves drawn to the six-string bass. Weighing roughly double the Affirma bass, this monster bass features an ash body with neck-thru construction (maple neck with purpleheart fretboard), classic Bartolini xxM56 B and T pickups with a Nitti-customized Bartolini NTMB+F three-band EQ, Hipshot A-style bridge, and Hipshot tuners. We\u2019ve got this one in the studio for review as well, so stay tuned! \u2014SK Has miniaturization gotten too extreme? If you blinked, you might have missed the bright green , because this fully functional bass amp fits in the palm of your hand and quite possibly the pocket of your cargo pants. Despite the ultra-compact size, the all metal enclosure felt quite rugged, with good resistance to the simple control interface: gain, bass, mid, treble, and volume. Full featured it\u2019s not, but you do get a post-EQ, balanced, XLR DI output for stage and studio use. And if you want to throw a 1.6 pounds, 200W/4 ohms, 130W/8 ohms amp into your gig bag, you\u2019ll never show up at a venue unable to play through their backline cabinet. Alternately, stick this compact unit on your night table, plug in some headphones, and you\u2019ve got a remarkably compact practice unit. This and a headless bass are all you need for easy travel and touring. Hotel room rehearsals are finally within your grasp! \u2014SK The is a new, compact bass amp head from the kings of micro-sized bass rigs. Beyond the gorgeous, blue, milled aluminum faceplate, you\u2019ll find 800w at 4ohms of power in a slick, rectangular brick that weighs just 5.7 pounds. A toggle adjusts input gain for active or passive basses, there\u2019s a balanced line out with pre/post EQ control, effects loop, headphone jack and more. Besides the small form factor, it even carries a small price tag\u2014just $799 street! Look for an in-depth review soon. \u2014SK Spector expanded their and bass lines in 2019 to include both 4- and 5-string models with a host of different configurations. For the Euro series, alder and walnut are tonewoods used for the bodies while maple necks with exotic wood fingerboards make up the rest of the instruments. Custom made pickups from Bartolini, Dimarzio, EMG and Aguilar are options throughout the product line. \u2014BS The new SansAmp YYZ pedal will be closer to most bassists hearts than the WIHO-award winning GED-2112 signature preamp ( ) as this compact unit distills Geddy Lee\u2019s optimized SansAmp tone down to a pedal that can serve as the front end to your direct recording or the front end of your live sound right into a PA system or a bass amp. And unlike the studio and touring rig-worthy GED-2112, the pedal won\u2019t cost you big money. It is a grand design, indeed. \u2014SK"

Reactive loadboxes are all the rage these days as players want to use their high-powered tube amps at reasonable volume levels, and in similar fashion to the Universal Audio OX, BOSS delivers more than just amplifier power attenuation. With the ability to load down your 100w heads with ease, it also has onboard speaker simulation, and provides the ability to load your own impulse responses. In typical BOSS fashion, they don\u2019t stop there, and also include a suite of BOSS effects, as well as an effects loop for your outboard effects. The WAZA Tube Amp Expander is also a USB interface, so if you need a one-stop solution to recording your tube amp at all hours of the night, or simply just need to the volume down without losing tone, you\u2019ll want to check this out. MAP $1,300. BOSS also showed their latest wireless unit, the , which is a stealthy, pedal format, rechargeable, wireless system that eliminates the need for a wireless transmitter pack hanging off of your guitar strap (just a small dongle plugged into your guitar output jack). With just a 65-foot operating range, this will cover the down and dirty bar gigs on your small board, and you\u2019ll have one less set of AA batteries to recharge.

Fans of clever sounding, pitch altering delay effects like Space and Black Hole will be right at home with this clever sounding effects pedal. And no, these sounds will not show up a month later as an algorithm for the H9 pedal\u2014the Rose sound creation DSP is too complex to fit in there. Upgrading their already popular powerfactor line, Eventide releases the pedalboard power supply. Staying current with current technology and the ever increasing power demands of modern digital pedals, this power supply offers a healthy 42 total watts of power over seven output jacks. Dip switches allow for 9,12, 15 or 18V operation per jack, and a meter on the top of the power supply indicates when you are at 40/70/90% of maximum power. \u2014BS What looks like a Tele, feels like a Strat, and sounds like a variety of acoustic guitars? The big news from Fender this year was the introduction of the guitar. We had the opportunity to play these beauties the week prior to NAMM at a special media event in New York City, and we definitely came away impressed. Fender worked with Fishman to develop custom electronics that use DSP in combination with an internal microphone, under-saddle Piezo elements, and a single coil pickup to create a vast array of different acoustic guitar tones, plus a handful of electric Tele tones. For the mostly acoustic player who needs to rock out on a few songs, this is a smart design. And it looks and feels great, too. Expect an in-depth review soon. Perhaps this is the year of the Tele in general, as Fender also showed off a , a recreation of his vintage axe that began the Led Zeppelin legacy. Fender continues to update and revise their most popular lines of instruments. The big news this year was the introduction of the American Performer line. The American Performer series delivers more value in an American-made Fender guitar priced sensibly in the $1,100-$1,200 range. The line-up includes Stratocaster, Telecaster, Jazzmaster, and Mustang models. They all feature newly designed Yosemite pickups, \u201870s style logos, Fender\u2019s Greasebucket tone system, Modern C-shaped neck radius, and modern color choices. We\u2019ve only had limited time with the guitar so far, but we were impressed with the clarity and warmth of the new Yosemite pickups. Another exciting edition to the Fender line-up was the new \u201862 Princeton Amp Chris Stapleton Edition. Modeled after a Princeton amp Chris has been using for years, this one combines the 6G2 circuit with some of Chris\u2019s personal preferences in an American made, hand-wired amp. This 12-watt beauty includes boutique features such as Fender vintage \u201cBlue\u201d tone caps, Schumacher transformers, 12-inch special design Eminence speaker, and tube-based tremolo, all housed in a solid pine cabinet. \u2014SK and MA Gibson guitars appeared to be back in a big way. With major upper management and leadership changes, its apparent they\u2019re listening to their customer base and going back to basics. Not even showing at The NAMM Show in 2018, their 2019 room felt like a breath of fresh air has been breathed into the brand. Gone were the robo tuners and richlite boards in favor of more traditional ebony and rosewood, and the typical Les Paul Studios, Standards and Customs were on display (and really looked good). They also featured five or six individual work stations where we were able to watch actual Gibson employees doing what they do: building precision instruments. It really was an education and reiterated just what goes into building these instruments. We will be keeping a close eye on Gibson and have high hopes the brand will return to form in 2019 and beyond. \u2014BS When a guitar amp company is situated in the pro audio hall instead of the guitar hall, it\u2019s easy to get overlooked. And just as we were getting ready to finish up our review of the fantastic Grandmeister 40 amplifier, we headed off to the NAMM Show and stumbled upon something new from these amp gurus\u2014the new Black Spirit 200 Amplifier! The is innovative in many ways, starting with what\u2019s missing\u2014the tubes! While the amp looks closely related to the other compact heads in the H&K lineup, this one generates tone by combining digital control with analog circuitry. It\u2019s a four-channel amp, covering the wide range of tones we\u2019re accustomed to getting from H&K amps, but also added is power amp sag control! The updated Red Box AE+ direct output offers eight speaker cabinet models, while the 200w power amp can power full-range speakers (like those you\u2019d use with amp modelers/profilers) or traditional guitar speaker cabinets. We sat down and played this one for a bit and our initial reaction was highly favorable. We didn\u2019t notice the lack of actual tubes from a tone perspective, though we didn\u2019t get to really crank things up. Or maybe that\u2019s the point? We didn\u2019t have to crank things up to enjoy the tone. This will be an exciting amp to get to know better. Look for a review later this year. \u2014SK Ibanez always has a host of new goodies on display, and this year, there were a ton of new models and flashy, hot color schemes. Although there were no new premium Jems for 2019, Ibanez struck back at the burgeoning counterfeit market by releasing two new, low-priced Jem models in the $500 price range in pink, white and yellow. Unlike years past, the inlay and specs of these instruments more closely resemble the more expensive models, making counterfeits essentially obsolete. Ibanez also showed off two fabulous new shredders from the RG Prestige line, the and the . The 2027 designation was done before, albeit in a limited run back in the late \u201890s, and we were excited to see a double-humbucker 7-string make an appearance. Equipped with arguably their best trem, the LoPro Edge, as well as DiMarzio Fusion Edge 7 pickups, this is a modern day workhorse\u2014and we just got it into our studios for review! The RG752M is a more traditionally spec\u2019ed 7-string, outfitted with the LoPro Edge 7 tremolo and DiMarzio PAF7 pickups. This instrument appears to only be available in Desert Yellow with a maple board at the moment. MusicPlayers.com friend and all around guitar guru, Andy Timmons, celebrated a 20th anniversary in his partnership with ibanez, and to commemorate this Ibanez released the A more traditionally styled instrument\u2014including a pre 1980s retro headstock, this will appeal to the classic rock generation. A roasted maple neck gives the guitar a beautiful patina. The guitar features three custom DiMarzio humbuckers cleverly disguised by their single-coil form factor, and a vintage style Gotoh tremolo. \u2014BS The , , and the provide excellent solutions for home rehearsal, studio, and live performance applications where a power soak or attenuation is needed. An interesting feature design is that they use jack input options in place of potentiometers for the different attenuation levels. Although you don\u2019t get a continuous, linear volume reduction, this fixed level approach purports to be more reliable and provide better signal consistency and clarity. The Loadbox II is particularly cool as it functions as a power attenuator, DI, and speaker simulator all in one box. \u2014DD It\u2019s hard getting loaner amps for review from smaller builders like Kyle Rhodes, where every amp built has a customer waiting for it. If only there were a way to get some awesome KSR tone into our guitar rigs? Well, now there is, because KSR just introduced the $400 gets you a lot of capability here, with three channels covering a diverse array of tones (and the colored LEDs indicate at an easy glance which channel you\u2019re playing through. We\u2019re tempted to grab one of these and plug straight into a nice stereo tube power amp\u2026 or stick it on our pedalboard! \u2014SK The big news this year at Line 6 is their line of . Variax tech has been around for some time now, and the Shuriken Variax gives us professional-grade instruments in a unique body style that is quite bold and classy. The guitar is alder with a 25.5\u201d scale length, 24 frets, and the Variax technology, which keeps getting better. Allowing for detunings and alternate tunings on the spot, we sat in on a demo which ran the range of tones and tunings in conjunction with the WIHO Award-winning Helix modeler (review here). Line 6 also replaced their compact G10 wireless unit with the new . While retaining a small footprint, they\u2019ve greatly expanded usability of this rechargeable wireless by adding manual frequency selection, cable tone options, a 3.5mm power supply jack, and nearly triple the effective range. Basically, Line 6 addressed every shortcoming of the original G10. Nice! \u2014BS Why do the electric guitar players have all the pedal effects fun? Not anymore, thanks to the designed for acoustic guitar players. The series launched last year, and this year, L.R. Baggs introduced the and pedals to the line. What\u2019s different about these pedals is that they are tonally optimized for the brighter, high fidelity sound of acoustic guitars, especially when using built-in pickups and Piezo elements. \u2014SK Already well known for building bone crushing, 100w, high-gain fire breathers like the Mzero Overdrive, Mezzabarba had an impressive booth this year which featured its entire product line. At the precipice was their new flagship amp, the Like the name implies, it\u2019s a three-channel amp that picks up where the Mzero leaves off in high gain and also features a stellar clean channel derived from the Z series of amps. Full MIDI implementation is also a first for Mezzabarba. Also exciting for us big rig fans was a new rackmount, three-channel preamp (already in use by guitar guru, Marco Sfogli). All three channels feature independant gain and eq controls. Just pair it with your favorite tube power amp and go! \u2014BS Last year, Mooer impressed us with the Red Truck, a fly rig-style multi-effects processor with outstanding sounds and features, and this year, they took things over the top with their new , which features amp modeling, multi effects, and synth sounds. Not just another me-too box, the GE300 does amp profiling (think Kemper), guitar profiling, and speaker profiling (to create your own IR files). You can also load your own impulse response files and pait them with over 100 different amp models. Not only do the amps and effects sound great, but the three-voice polyphonic synth did an impressive job of immersing us in cool guitar synth sounds, without the need for any special guitar pickups or complexity. We look forward to getting our hands on a review unit. \u2014SK New for 2019, PRS continues to expand their sensibly priced SE line of guitars. The , , and the provide the look, feel and tone of their premium PRS guitars without the hefty price tag. The King Crimson Schizoid is a limited edition model, with only 1,000 of these disturbing looking guitars scheduled for production. We\u2019ve got one in the studio for review right now, and it works great even if you can\u2019t play in odd time signatures! \u2014DD Kings of the tuner have a colorful future ahead if their new pedal tuners are any indication. They feature classic Peterson strobe tuning and displays in beautiful, multi-colored LCD. Your tuner never looked so hot. \u2014SK What looks like a boutique Tele-style guitar but is just subtly different? That would be the beautiful new Greg is a monster player, both in sound and in stature (way past six feet tall), and his custom T-style guitar has a slightly larger body: big enough to not look so tiny when set against a larger musician, but still small enough to fit into any standard guitar case. It's also got a beautiful, sculpted top reminiscent of a Firebird, great hardware including a Wilkinson Staggered Brass Saddle bridge, and Greg's customized Fishman Fluence pickups. All this custom goodness comes with a reasonable price-tag, too! \u00a0Just $1,600 street. Learn everything possible about this guitar and much worse, err... we mean, much more, from our in-depth conversation with Greg, below. \u2014SK Part 1 of 2 Part 2 of 2 Once upon a time, Suhr was just known for their fantastic guitars, but today, their amps are just as adored. And what\u2019s not to love about the new , designed with artist Pete Thorn? This compact, three-channel head is a low wattage, 6V6 powered, tube amplifier with a variety of American and British tones, but it\u2019s more than just a typical amplifier. Suhr\u2019s Reactive Load technology is built in, along with on-board impulse responses. This lets you run the head direct to front of house for live performances or direct to the mixing desk for recording, while the headphone jack and aux input make it easy for you to jam alone or to backing tracks all night long. What\u2019s extra-cool about the IRs is that you can assign different IRs to each channel for a wider range of tones than is typical. \u2014SK The features a new round shoulder design while incorporating the revolutionary Taylor V-class bracing. With this combined design, the Grand Pacific offers an enhanced low-end power while maintaining those warm, traditional acoustic tones. The other new addition to their line the the Builder\u2019s Edition Collection. Ergonomic features depending on model can include chamfered body edges, beveled cutaway, carved armrest, and a compound carved neck profile. The contouring features are designed to enhance your comfort and playability, and once you play a dreadnaught with a sculpted top bout, it\u2019s hard to go back to acoustics with those classic, hard, top edges. Even if you can\u2019t afford Taylor\u2019s range of $3,000+ models, though, there\u2019s plenty of good news for the rest of us, as V-class bracing is proliferating across all of the Taylor guitar lines. \u2014DD"

      "value": "Arturia released the curious synth. Using some of Mutable Instrument\u2019s Plaits Eurorack open-source oscillator algorithms (including Superwave, Harmonic Oscillator, Karplus-Strong, Wavetable, Virtual Analog, Waveshaper, FM, Grain, Chords, Speech, and Modal), an SEM-style filter, an odd PCB keyboard, a modulation matrix, four-voice paraphonic sound, and polyphonic aftertouch, all housed in a form factor reminiscent of the Microbrute, you\u2019ve got a curious sounding synth. It comes with 128 presets and additional space for your own creations. We did squeeze in a few moments with it, and there\u2019s definitely potential for creating some funky sounds. If you want something a little bit out of the mainstream, check this out. \u2014JB Most American musicians are unfamiliar with the Italian company Dexibel, but we\u2019re beginning to think they should be. Dexibel was showing their new , with a newly developed 88-key, hammer action keyboard with \u201chybrid structure\u201d (wood & plastic) and aftertouch! Even more impressive, the S9 is equipped with motorized draw-faders for Organ/Mixer/MIDI control, and this stage piano also includes XLR balanced outputs. Other features include unlimited notes polyphony, 24-bit/48kHz sound quality, and over fifteen seconds of recorded waves (for some samples) for \u201cmore accurate decay\u201d as per the Dexibel staff. The VIVO S9 also has a wave memory bank of 1.5 GB with the possibility to fully reconfigure the instrument using new sounds from the DEXIBELL library or alternately from standard Sound Font-format files, which are readily available online. The S7 shares similar specs, but lacks the motorized faders and has fewer hardware controls. We were impressed by the sound quality, and the keyboard itself felt good, too. We\u2019re planning to start reviewing their products in 2019. \u2014JB Deskew Technologies introduced the new software, and this popular solution for running soft synths and virtual instruments on your laptop gained a few fantastic new features including arranging of songs and set lists, and song parts, which makes it easier to reuse plug-ins in multiple songs without having to set up duplicate audio chains. Ilio also added Ableton Link integration as well as a MIDI recorder function. \u2014SK Korg was busy this year, though most of their releases were upgrades of previously released products. The two Volca releases are the and the . The Volca drum is a battery-powered, digital percussion synthesizer with a 16-step sequencer and custom LCD. It is six-voice polyphonic, and its sounds are modelled analogue waveforms with bit reduction, a wave folder, and an optional overdrive. The output then passes through a modelled waveguide resonator. Korg Sync In and Out jacks are provided, and the Volca Drum can be locked to MIDI via a MIDI input. The Volca Drum retails for $149. The volca modular is the volca form factor take on a modular system, and Korg has squeezed quite a bit in: dual oscillators, capable of wave folding and frequency modulation, two function generators, two low-pass gates, a utility module, a splitter, a sequencer, and a digital effect simply known as \u201cSpace Out\u201d which is kind of like a delay/reverb effect. Many of the modules are internally connected, allowing the synth to be used without pin cables. The Minilogue was originally introduced in 2016, and was Korg\u2019s take on four-voice analog synthesis in a small (37-key) keyboard form factor. The next-generation features the same twin analogue oscillators and 37 \u201cslim key\u201d keyboard, but adds a third digital oscillator. Each voice includes a a noise generator, a VPM oscillator, and the possibility to load user programmed oscillators! The Minilogue XD has a 16-step polyphonic sequencer with SYNC IN and SYNC OUT jacks as well as two CV IN jacks, letting you connect to other modular devices. MSRP is $619.99. The , as you can guess, is a special edition of the Kronos that adds a graded metallic red finish, as well as additional orchestral sounds, plus a new Italian\u2011made grand piano that debuted in the Korg Grandstage (reviewed here). It's available in 61-note ($3,099.99), 73-note ($3,499.99), and 88-note ($3,799.99) versions. \u2014JB Roland didn\u2019t release any new pro synths this year, but did add two new entries to its virtual synthesizer collection. For those unaware, the SRX-series boards were first introduced in 2000: they were small boards with 64MB ROMs containing patches and rhythm sets that upgraded (internally) quite a few Roland synths and modules. was one of these, and has now been recreated for the virtual platform. SRX World contains instruments found in Africa, Asia and India, as well as around the globe. It comes with 407 unique patches, 10 rhythm sets and 867 waveforms. Interestingly, we asked the Roland staff at NAMM if this was an exact duplication of the original card of the same name, to which they said it was not, stating there were some name changes and sample upgrades, but was close. The other virtual instrument is . Designed to run through Roland\u2019s sample player Concerto (also a Cloud download), it contains several classic drum kits and features six kicks, five snares, nine toms, and seven cymbals, all sampled with varied articulation and multiple microphone placements and played with sticks, brushes, and hot rods. You can also choose microphone type and placement. Presets help you get started in a variety of styles. During the demo, we noticed there were no loops or drag and drop MIDI patterns, so for now, you\u2019ll have to program your own beats. But we were told that pre-defined loops/grooves/beats are likely to come in a future update. \u2014JB While other software products seem to get updated with major point releases nearly every year, Spectrasonics takes a much more calculated path, taking their time, and just introducing things when it truly matters. This year, they introduced , which has some updates sure to please many users of this outstanding soft synth. External hardware synth integration is awesome, and it just got better with support for over 60 popular keyboards. Rather than going through the tedious process of MIDI mapping or utilizing MIDI learn features to map synth controls to generic MIDI controller keyboards (which you can do, of course), Spectrasonics includes auto mapping to the controls on popular current and past synthesizers, such as the Roland Juno 106 and D-50, Access Virus (many versions), and even maps to recent products like the Sequential Prophet 08, Behringer Deepmind, and Yamaha Reface CS. The arpeggiator has been greatly expanded in its functionality, and we love that the MIDI data generated by the arpeggiator now gets written out as standard MIDI data for external manipulation in your DAW/host. And yes, lots of new sounds, too! Get ready for more D-50 sounds as the sound development team dug deep into L.A. synthesis for this release. Omnisphere 2.6 should be shipping this month (March). \u2014SK The is the interface we\u2019ve wanted since first reviewing the fantastic SL88 Grand keyboard controller ( ). This compact control surface is a match made in heaven (or perhaps, China), as its magnetic base secures it firmly to the metal housing of the SL88. Suddenly, that elegant yet sparse controller gains eight control knobs and nine faders, plus additional transport controls. You can, of course, use this fabulous control surface with MIDI products, but if you\u2019ve got a StudioLogic controller, adding this interface is a no-brainer. \u2014SK Yamaha introduced the new , which were definitely among this year\u2019s keyboard highlights.The (73 keys, balanced hammer action) and (88 keys, graded hammer, natural wood, triple sensor action, synthetic Ebony and Ivory key tops) both have the same internal sound engine. Like other popular stage pianos, there are three main sections that can be split or combined quickly as desired: Piano, Electric Piano, and Sub (sub contains pads, strings, and other synth sounds). Both models include voices sampled from the Yamaha CFX and B\u00f6sendorfer Imperial grand pianos, Yamaha U1 upright, CP80 electric grand and other instruments, including strings, pads, organs and chromatic percussion. Also included is a rotary speaker simulation, as well as synth-like attack and release controls, plus tempo-syncable delay, reverb, and a three-band, global, master EQ. There are balanced XLR outs to allow connection on stage without direct boxes, too! Amazingly, the 73-key version weighed only 28 pounds (and the 88 key was still a reasonable, but heavier, 41 pounds). We had the opportunity to play the CP88 just prior to the NAMM Show in the quiet and calm of Yamaha\u2019s Manhattan studio and were impressed by everything: the playability, the sounds, and the user interface. We\u2019ll have a complete, in-depth review coming shortly, but our initial impression is that this is a top contender in a crowded market. Though not aimed at the pro market, you might enjoy the fun factor of the . When used in conjunction with the free Yamaha Chord Tracker app, this keytar altars your performance so that you never play a wrong note. It\u2019s a way to get young players enjoying the experience before they have their training wheels removed. The rest of us can alternately use the SHS-500 as a true keytar, wrong notes and lousy performance included. And with an internal sound engine of its own (including piano, synths, and two drum kits), you can be up and running in an instant. MSRP $499. \u2014JB and SK"

While USB mics are nothing new, Antelope ups the ante by building their FPGA FX and mic modeling technology directly into the microphone. Using the companion software, dial up your choice of microphone emulation, along with emulations of vintage channel strip processing and a few digital effects, and get zero latency, processed audio straight into your laptop. You just might be able to record your next hit vocal in the hotel bathroom while on tour... or vacation! $1,600 gets an all-inclusive kit, as detailed in the video below. \u2014SK Audio-Technica introduced the range. This fourth generation wireless microphone system operates in a 300\u2019 range and is available in two frequency ranges. It even has a multifunction button right on the handheld and body pack transmitters in case of unexpected interference that enables you to quickly switch to another frequency on the fly. We liked the fact that the capsule on the handheld is interchangeable, too. Audio-Technica offers two cardioid condensers, a hypercardioid dynamic, and a cardioid dynamic capsule that can each be used with this system. \u2014AS Thomas Barefoot continues to wow us and remain unpredictable. Specifically, Barefoot has upped the ante again, and this time it's for the high-end Hip Hop and EDM markets. The item is the new , a dual 15-inch subwoofer. The Low-Frequency Effects bass driver can be setup in a 5:1 or 2-channel stereo configuration. It can be used with any Barefoot system as well as third party systems featuring smooth crossover bandwidth to cancel out phase anomalies when cranking it up. With this beast at your mix desk, we are confident that you will never be asked to turn up the bass again! \u2014JL The is CTM\u2019s first signature in-ear monitors. The design was inspired by Aaron Spears, drummer for Usher/Ariana Grande. When we stopped by their booth, he was giving a demonstration of the AS-7. Once we tried the AS-7, we instantly noticed the detail in the sound. Their frequency response is 20Hz- 20kHz and they feature seven drivers. One cool feature is that they come with two interchangeable filters that can either boost bass or highs depending on which filter you prefer. Universal fit is $1,200 or you can order custom fit IEMs for $1,500. \u2014AS The is great little product that has been out for a while but somehow escaped our notice! There a number of models to choose from, and they provide clean discrete gain to dynamic microphones and Ribbon microphones. Specifically, the Cloud Lifters provide up to +25dB of ultra-clean gain in two distinct stages and optimal impedance loading for dynamic and ribbon mics to perform their best. Cloud Microphones makes a full line of Ribbon microphones including an RCA 44 style model that we will definitely seek to review in the future. \u2014JL We were stunned and excited to see what just might be the best patchbay system we have ever encountered! It\u2019s no joke, The Flock Audio PATCH System blew us away because it a is a digitally controlled, but 100% analog, audio patchbay routing system. The way they achieve this a combination of software known as the PATCH App and a 64 Point Connection PATCH Hardware component. This tandem allows users to easily route and control analog audio routings without having to resort to the use of manual patch cables. The PATCH App software application is OS X & Windows compatible. Audio signal \ufb02ows are shown from top to bottom via a PATH architecture. Signal \ufb02ows are divided up into single vertical columns allowing users to drag and drop available analog audio equipment connected to the PATCH\u2019s hardware component. This analog audio equipment is cataloged in the Hardware Index located to the left side of the PATCH App. The Hardware component is a 1U rack mountable unit that acts as the centerpiece of your analog setup, and it has eight DB-25 connectors for inputs and outputs on the rear of the unit, plus a few additional patch points on the face of the unit. Similar to Dangerous Music\u2019s Remote, digital control over analog audio signals makes the PATCH System unique and unlike anything else in the audio industry. Look for a full review this quarter!! \u2014JL If you really want to stand out from the rest, you may want to consider one of Metaldozer\u2019s microphone stands. They have designed gear for many famous artists including Prince, Robert Plant, Dream Theater, Billy Idol, The Temptations, Toni Braxton, Reba McEntire, and Night Ranger. Metaldozer can replicate stands that your favorite artists use or custom design a stand to your specifications. Your logo can be displayed on the pole or base of your stand. Powder coating is offered in multiple colors as well as chrome and nickel plating. The stand that made the biggest impression on us was the . It\u2019s an all aluminum mic stand powered by 9V batteries. The LEDs come in white, green, blue or red. It\u2019s definitely a great addition if you are looking to make a visual impact at your shows. \u2014AS This was so much fun it definitely deserves a mention. The is a compact unit designed for performance-oriented vocal effects. Battery or USB-bus powered, there are some fun 24-bit/192kHz effects on hand, including harmonizing, vocoding, pitch shifting, hard tuning, and more. With a handful of sliders, knobs, and buttons, there are no menus and there\u2019s plenty of instant gratification! If you want to sound like a chipmunk or Darth Vader instantly, just turn a knob! Even better, you can connect a MIDI keyboard to control harmonies and voicings. This is targeted at the DJ crowd, but we know keyboard players will absolutely have a blast with this. Get your wacky vocal treatments going for just $229.99. \u2014JB We were very excited about Samson\u2019s . There are six different models ranging from 50 watts to 300 watts of power. The lowest level system is great for small audiences of 25-50 people, while the top model can accommodate between 300-500 people. No need to worry about finding an outlet to plug one of these babies into! Their anticipated battery life ranges from 12 to 20 hours depending on the model of choice. Almost all systems have XLR/quarter-inch combo mic inputs and most models include a handheld wireless mic. Some other features include onboard mixers, Bluetooth connectivity, and easy portability as a single unit. We think many singer/songwriters will find these PA systems very useful to accommodate a variety of live performances. No more excuses for not singing at the family picnic, either! \u2014AS When it comes to using in-ear monitors, the goal is to not only hear mixes better but to protect your hearing. Audiologist and President of Sensaphonics, Dr. Michael Santucci, is dedicated to helping everyone in the music industry protect their most valuable asset. The is a sound analyzer that shows actual in-ear sound pressure level (SPL) while wearing IEMs or headphones! Levels are checked in real time by plugging in between the sound source and earphones. Simply select the model IEMs or headphones from the dB Check Pro library and play. It will display a weighted SPL and safe exposure time according to NIOSH and OSHA guidelines. The dB Check Pro can also measure ambient room levels with its on-board microphone. Sensaphonics also announced their . One of the things we loved was the soft, silicone earpieces\u2014comfortable! Another notable feature is their isolation spec, up to 45.5dB. Only $600 for custom fit! \u2014AS Of the more unusual items we discovered at the NAMM Show, the VocalMist Portable Nebulizer with Isotonic Saline is the perfect accessory product for the working vocalist. It\u2019s lightweight, runs on USB rechargeable lithium batteries, and operates by simply pressing a button. Vocal Mist can help keep your vocal folds hydrated which in turn will help reduce the amount of pressure it takes to phonate. VM sells their portable nebulizer with either 15, 50 or 100 packs of saline. Saline packs can also be purchased separately. Interesting! \u2014AS This is a nifty training tool/app for singers! Vocalize anywhere by singing along with piano, voice, or both. Voxercise includes two download packages for free. Additional packs are available for purchase with a portion donated to non-profit music education organizations. The app allows you to customize your range or use a preset. Follow along with sheet music or notes played on a piano. Voxercise will show you if you are in tune, flat, or sharp, which is an awesome feature to help improve your intonation. What a convenient way to warm up for a show! \u2014AS It seems that every year, Warm Audio introduces new products, and this year they are upping the ante in the microphone department. Warm introduced the new Warm Audio 251, a re-creation of the legendary Telefunken 251, and they are also offering a re-creation of the Nuemann KM-84 in their Warm WA-84. Both are exciting additions to the Warm line and will no doubt find their way into our studios for review this year. Although neither are identical to the originals in look or sound, they are faithful re-creations that are true to the classic spirit and vibe of their influences, but delivered with a modern Warm Audio twist. \u2014JL"

      "value": "Fresh off the success of the WIHO Award-winning Strike Pro Drum Kit ( ), Alesis is back with a fantastic option for acoustic drummers who simply need to expand their kits with new electronic sounds: the . Alesis has made electronic multi-pads for years, but this new model really takes things to the next level as the brand continues to introduce products serving the professional drummer. The Strike MultiPad has built-in sampling, audio looping, and comes pre-loaded with over 8,000 samples to get you started... and the Strike family drum sounds are great! Throw this into your kit and add a kick drum trigger and you\u2019ll be ready to tackle just about anything asked of you (other than perhaps playing a guitar solo). \u2014SK Behold the stunning glory of\u2026 almond! is a thing of beauty without question. This is the first kit we\u2019ve heard of to feature this unusual wood choice, and according to DW, the sound is in the ballpark of oak and purpleheart. Only fifty kits are slated for manufacture. Get one and you will certainly be the envy of your drummer friends. \u2014SK New this year is the line of cymbals (not pictured). They feature the same profile and weight of familiar Legend cymbals, but according to Istanbul, thanks to a shallow lathing and hammered bell, they produce a more complex and drier sound than the standard Legend line. Look for a 15\u201d hi-hat, 18\u201d crash, 20\u201d crash ride, and 22\u201d ride. \u2014SK Meinl has released a new premium line of cymbals, the , which is now their top line of cymbals. They are crafted from B20 alloy and deliver rich and complex darker tones. They are one of a kind, hand hammered, with extra hammering that creates craters across the surface of the cymbal. The combination of this extra hammering creates a dry stick attack coupled with rich undertones. In addition, the cymbals come individually packaged in a box that includes a set of sticks and gloves to delicately handle the cymbal. Each also comes with a certificate of authenticity. \u2014MA Paiste has released new models in their and these babies sound fantastic. The Signature series has been available now for almost 30 years and is made of a proprietary bronze alloy. Even in the big drum hall at NAMM the musicality of these cymbals shinned. Overall they are a medium bright but with a full, rich and wide range. The ride cymbals had a sweet balance of clear sticking with a nice full wash. The hi-hats were the sound in my head. I couldn\u2019t stop playing them and the crash cymbals were crisp with just the right decay. \u2014MA The highlight of Pearl\u2019s 2019 NAMM presence must be their demonstration of the module. Mergeable into complete electronic sets ( the EM53T e/Traditional Components or the EM53HB e/Hybrid Components which boasts slightly upgraded add-on components), the module boasts 36 onboard effects, 128 polyphonic voices, 44.1Hz/16-Bit WAV recording capabilities, 8 direct outs, and everything else in-between to fill in the gaps. Marketed as the module for the ultimate drum enthusiast, the built-in 700 HD Voice Sound Library demonstrates Pearl\u2019s commitment towards both modern and classic drum players. \u2014MS Remo has released two different bass drum products to externally EQ and dampen your drum set without the addition of pillows or anything else you may throw inside your drumset. The attaches over the batter head and then has up to four foam inserts that insert under the external ring. The flexibility in the number and position of the inserts allows you to find just the right amount of dampening in just the right spot. The ring is made of a hard plastic that once installed will not have any contact with the head and therefore not cause any weird buzzing noises. The inserts are made of a non-slip foam with tabs for easy removal and repositioning. It is available for bass drums 18\u201d-24\u201d The is a product developed with drummer extraordinaire Steve Weckl. The dampener attaches to the bass drum hoop (the head does not need to be removed) and can be placed anywhere around the hoop on either the batter or resonant side, and more than one on each side can be used. Also, the positioning of the dampening foam can be adjusted from the near middle to the edge of the head. \u2014MA Addressing the needs of the practice space, Sabian unveiled their newest line of cymbals with an emphasis on lack of emphasis\u2014in other words, quieter cymbals! Sabian\u2019s boast a stain and dent-resistant finish, yet are extremely thin and quiet, all the while responsive and uniquely versatile for applications. Currently, there are four different box sets available. The new includes 14\u201d Hats, 16\u201d-17\u201d-18\u201d Crashes, and 20\u201d-21\u201d Rides that expertly navigate between tonality and volume with a richly dark sonic profile ideal for smaller spaces, or wherever traditional cymbals are just too damn loud. \u2014MS There\u2019s more than just a flashy finish to the latest Tama Starclassic drums. New this year is the . Tama\u2019s latest pairing of these classic woods claims to offer the clear attack and higher frequency projection of birch combined with the low/mid frequency warmth of walnut. The drums feature four plies of birch plus two inner plys of American Black walnut (and a fifth ply of birch on the kick drum). Hardware features Tama\u2019s Quick-Lock brackets on their Star-Cast Mounting System, zinc di-cast hoops, and the drums ship with Evans Genera G2 two-play clear batter heads and single-ply bottom heads, while the kick drum has an EQ4 batter head. \u2014SK Vic Firth recently released the . Currently offered in 7A, 85A, 5A, 55A, and 5B widths ranging from 0.54\u201d to 0.6\u201d, they are all 17 inches long and provide drummers the versatility to shorten and lengthen their reach to accommodate different styles. Although the sticks are longer, they have longer tapers and are well balanced. They weigh-in at just under 2 ounces which makes them very comfortable. \u2014MA Yamaha\u2019s new is on our short list of great desires. A complex sounding name befitting a complex sounding drum. This gorgeous newcomer to the line features handcrafted oak shells with a phenolic hybrid center ply intended to enhance the attack and tonal characteristics of the oak. The drums feature a wide tuning range, bass enhancement weights for increased low-end response from the bass drum, and that insane finish was inspired by a traditional Japanese uzukuri process that shows off the stunning visual properties of oak wood. \u2014SK"

      "value": "In 2013, we reviewed the , and in 2016 we reviewed the . While we love the software that comes bundled with the controllers, and are huge fans of Arturia\u2019s , the original keyboards proved to be a mixed bag, with the keybed specifically being the thing most people lamented. We didn\u2019t find those to be particularly well made, with a few of them breaking on us from strictly studio use. Arturia has now released the Keylab MkII, in which they claim a better built keyboard. But before you go digging through our other Arturia product reviews , we will say that feature-wise, the Arturia Keylab controllers make excellent controllers for your soft-synths, and their deep integration with Arturia's own software products\u2014like the incredible V-Collection\u2014make them an easy choice for many players. The Keylab MkII comes in 49- and 61-key versions, in both white and black. You get 16 multicolor backlit pads, nine faders, nine rotary knobs, and the pitch and mod wheels have now moved to a more popular position at left of the keybed (the original Keylab had them located above the keys). The net effect is that the 49-key MkII version is nearly as long as the original 61-key version. To see the different layouts, we took a photo of them side by side (with the MkII on top), as seen here: A nice touch is that pretty much all the knobs and buttons are backlit, though the sliders aren\u2019t. It would have also been cool if there were demarcations on the sliders\u2014which the original had\u2014though this is certainly not a deal breaker. In the center is the \u201cbig knob,\u201d which these days has become more common on Arturia and other manufacturers products. Below this are three buttons labeled Analog Lab, DAW, and User respectively. Analog Lab mode, as you might guess, automatically maps the controls to specific functions in Analog Lab (now at version 3 and included with KeyLab). DAW mode switches controls to your recording software, and Arturia even includes magnetic overlays for Pro Tools and other DAWs (Logic, Reaper, Cubase, Abelton, and Studio One) to help you see what the ten buttons above the transport controls do. Finally, User mode gives you access to ten user-defined maps of your creation. You can set up a custom map for another instrument or effect you wish to control. One major upgrade from the original is the addition of CV connections! The rear panel, besides the expected USB, pedal, and MIDI connectors, also includes five control voltage connections: Pitch Out, Gate Out, 2 Mod Outs and CV In. The CV outputs can be used to send control voltages and triggers to a modular synthesis system, while the input can be used to receive incoming control voltages and turn them into MIDI data that go into your DAW. The voltage range can be defined using the \u201cUser Edit\u201d mode, or through Arturia\u2019s free software, MIDI Control Center (MCC). So you are essentially getting a CV to MIDI converter! Arturia diagrams this as below: Of course, many are wondering, \u201chow does it feel?\u201d The sliders and knobs feel a bit sturdier and better quality than the original, and the sixteen pads definitely provide a big upgrade in feel from the original. And, the dedicated chord buttons provide additional functionality. So how about the keys? Happily, they are velocity sensitive and provide aftertouch. But are the keys really any more reliable than those in the original? Honestly, only time will tell. In a side by side comparison, compared to the original Keylab 61 in our studio, the MkII did feel slightly better: more even key-to-key and less \u201csticky,\u201d so this is obviously a different keybed. But only time will tell if the keys hold up better. Feel is subjective, but the keys do feel better to us, but just slightly. The difference in feel is not as large as the marketing might suggest. Bundled software includes Arturia\u2019s excellent Analog Lab, Abelton Live Lite, and Piano V (which can be read about in previous Keylab reviews mentioned at the beginning). The Keylab MkII 49 (MSRP $499) and Keylab MkII 61 (MSRP $549) can be found online for approximately $450 and $500 respectively. If you don\u2019t already own the original versions, or if you have a lot of modular gear in need of a flexible keyboard interface, these are nice controllers. Arturia www.arturia.com"

He stands apart from a crowded field of indie artists by having a unique, genre-blurring sound that should be equally appealing to fans of alternative rock, shoegaze, new wave, and melodic progressive rock. On his latest release, , Guinness doesn\u2019t stray from his familiar sound and style, which is a good thing, because we\u2019re not done enjoying it any more than he had exhausted writing songs with a particular sense of style. The overall vibe of is laid back and dreamy, even when up-tempo and rocking (this musical oxymoron really works here), and Guinness\u2019 smooth baritone delivery still conjures up (for us) images of David Bowie and Iva Davies of Icehouse fame, the latter of whom shares more common musical footing thanks to the lush synth textures. Not to confuse this record with anything synth-pop, however, it has plenty of great acoustic and electric guitar, too, and you\u2019ll even hear some horns and orchestration pop up now and then. You can\u2019t mistake the musical influence of artists like Pink Floyd on songs like \u201cNow\u201d or the Cure vibe in Guinness\u2019 heavenly song, \u201cEmbassy Walls.\u201d And, you\u2019ll find some great vocal harmony work reminiscent of Simon & Garfunkel as well as Pink Floyd.

Of course, if you happen to be a full-time roadie or production stage hand, then this product is for you, too. The Gig Gloves are designed to protect your hands while loading and moving music gear. If you\u2019ve ever pinched or sliced up your hands on the latches of racks and equipment cases, these gloves are for you. Need a better grip on oversized, bulky bits of gear you\u2019re loading in to the gig? Again, these are for you. W e\u2019ve had these for a few months now and have to say, these are a hand saver! The gloves are made from a combination of strong fabric materials with leather grip surfaces on the fingertips, textured non-slip regions in the palm that are padded for comfort holding heavier gear, and reflective, rubber padding on the top and fingers that both protect your hands and also act as a helpful reflective surface so your crew mates don\u2019t accidently close a case on your hands. ( ). Other thoughtful design considerations that we liked: we could operate our smart phone without having to remove the gloves, and for actual precise typing on it, the first three fingers of each glove have a clever slit through which you can slide your fingertips out for precise typing without having to remove the gloves. But the best thing about these is that our hands didn\u2019t get blistered or cut before the real fun started\u2014playing the gig! Nothing to fault here whatsoever\u2014we really like the Gig Gloves, and will never be our own crew without them. And, for those of you gigging in colder climates, they even come in a version with a fleece lining, though here in the New York area, we see no need for that. Prices range from $39 to $45 street depending on your need for the lining. That\u2019s a small price to pay for solid hand protection that even makes it easier to carry bulky music gear.

Many gear junkies know his name from the numerous articles he has written for Sweetwater and books that he has written such as . Aside from being a well-known writer of over a thousand articles, he was also editor-in-chief of and senior technical editor of . He has made over 1,500 informative gear videos. His list of credits also includes engineering and producing. Mitch has certainly worn many hats in the industry and we can now tack two more onto his list: composing and playing. Mitch Gallagher ignites his passion for music as composer and guitarist on his new solo album, But what a surprise! We assumed that with his background, this was going to be some kind of rock record. Boy were we wrong! He totally caught us off guard with this tasty collection of jazz, funk, and blues material. We were very impressed by the musicianship throughout . Gallagher is in good company, playing with Keith Carlock on drums (Steely Dan, Mike Stern, Sting, Toto) and Adam Nitti on bass (Michael McDonald, Dave Weckl, Kenny Loggins). Add to that special guest guitarist Carl Verheyen, Tyler Summers on Saxophone, and one of Nashville\u2019s best horn sections and you have the makings of musical perfection! This five-song EP is an absolute treat whether you are a musician or music lover. Although this album is strictly instrumental, Mitch Gallagher knows how to create singable melodies. His love of music clearly comes across with use of multiple genres in his compositions. The first track, \u201cFoundation,\u201d with its Latin-inspired drums, has an almost Santana-esque feel to it. Other tracks like \u201cNaturally Clean\u201d and \u201cCascade\u201d seemed to encompass elements of Jazz Fusion, Big Band and Bebop Jazz. Each track has a unique character to it and with each listen you find more to appreciate about Mitch\u2019s skillful writing. We think one of the many things about that held our attention was the rich instrumentation. With a horn section that includes saxophones, trumpets, trombone, three different pianos (Hammond B3, electric piano, and grand piano), there is not one moment of boredom. Mitch also shines as a masterful guitarist on this album whether he is playing a tasty linear or harmonic guitar solo. On , Mitch Gallagher truly shows why he has been a recognized expert in the music community for decades. He backs up his written smarts with musical chops aplenty. His writing is spot-on for the genre and provides space for all players on the record to shine. We look forward to hearing more from Mitch in the future."

      "value": "We were very impressed by the we reviewed last year, and we installed it permanently into one of our editor\u2019s studios. So when it was time to update the studio in the main MusicPlayers.com office, Zaor made the short list of brands to consider once again. And after building a spreadsheet full of different companies\u2019 desks and their dimensions, matching racks, monitor bridges, and keyboard shelves, we found our ideal desk configuration in Zaor\u2019s MIZA product series. The MIZA line is pretty extensive and comes in a variety of colors. For our needs, the MIZA M desk proved to be just the right starting point. Before we go into further details note that the MIZA M is a desk with pull-out keyboard shelf, but the rack shelves holding the monitor speakers in the photo are options that aren\u2019t required. You can add them to any desk\u2014from Zaor or otherwise. Given our large studio space, the MIZA M\u2019s 61\u201d x 33.5\u201d size (1,550mm x 850mm) was ideal. We needed a desktop that could accommodate a computer\u2019s 27\u201d display and large monitor speakers with 8\u201d speakers. The optional MIZA Griprack 2 MkII racks integrated as if part of the desk itself, and cutouts for cable management in the top of the MIZA M desk surface facilitate easy passthrough of cables from installed rack gear. Monitor decoupling pads come pre-glued into the top surface of the racks, and they eliminated the need for external solutions that would otherwise cause the height of the speakers to be less than optimal. It should be noted that if you don\u2019t have the budget for a full range of Zaor furniture, you could just get yourself a pair of Griprack racks and attach them to a less costly desk\u2014they have a U-shaped design that goes over and under the rear edge of your desk and then attaches with large thumbscrews for a secure hold. They also come in 4U configurations, but in our case, with the Miza M desk having a 32\u201d (818mm) desktop height, we found the 2U racks better for speaker height. This is primarily solid wood furniture\u2014not cheap particle board furniture (though some pieces of the assembly are melamine faced chipboard), and as such, the desk alone weighs over 100 pounds. The pull-out shelf rolls on both a guided track and wheels, and easily accommodates heavy, fully-weighted controller keyboards like our StudioLogic SL88 Grand (in fact it\u2019s rated at up to 66lbs/30Kg). Behind the desk you\u2019ll find integrated cable management that is truly easy to utilize\u2014a long, sculpted piece of wood flips down on hinges for you to run cables along the rear. There are also cable passthroughs from the keyboard shelf to the rear. We also purchased a pair of MIZA Rack 12 equipment racks, as a double-width unit was not part of the series at this time. Anticipating that many customers would place a few of these racks in series, there are useful cable passthroughs in the rear of the racks on the sides that make for clean patching from one rack to the other. The racks are beautiful, with two color, sculpted sides that match the product family\u2019s style, and they feature pull-out drawers underneath to hold miscellaneous gear. There is cable management built into the rear of the racks, and while useful to those of you whose rack rears may be customer facing, we found this to be the one negative design element of an otherwise exceptional product line. We actually had some equipment that was too deep to fit into the rack until we came upon a perfectly workable solution\u2014remove the rear of the rack! You\u2019ve got to be handy for this move, as it required using a power saw in the workshop, but one straight cut was all it took, preserving the top portion of the rear that is part of the overall frame assembly. You can see in our photo the difference that this made. Zaor have informed us that they are working on redesigning the rack to better accommodate deep studio gear. And while it looks like you would have a hard time connecting all of your studio gear when the cable management column is installed, the beautiful design is equally functional, and the curved cut-out sides makes access from the rear rather easy. In daily use, the Zaor MIZA line has proved to be as functional as it is beautiful, and everyone who has been to our studio has complimented and inquired about the furniture. Installation is not for the timid, however. Just as complex musical performances require warming up, we suggest first getting comfortable building an IKEA desk, file cabinet, and series of drawers. How did you like the IKEA instructions? Hopefully you answered \u201cpiece of cake,\u201d because Zaor\u2019s assembly materials could stand some improvement. Experienced assemblers shouldn\u2019t have any trouble, but here are a few to be aware of before un-boxing the furniture: MIZA M desk: $1,149. MIZA Griprack 2U MkII: $279 per unit. MIZA Rack 12: $499 per unit. Our total cost: $2,705 delivered. These prices include freight delivery, and the unassembled and extremely-well packaged furniture was shipped on a wooden palette with a final weight of nearly 500 pounds in total. Again, this is quality furniture that was hand crafted in Europe. For our studio requirements, it was money well spent. Zaor www.zaorstudiofurniture.com"

The guitarist was showcasing their new flagship floorboard, the GT1000. Designed to be used in a multitude of situations, BOSS takes into account just how common it is for guitar players to record ourselves at home and they now provide USB connectability on their pro floorboard. Borrowing from both the Katana and Waza line of sounds, there are a staggering number of combinations to be had and you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a musical situation their new floorboard isn\u2019t at least useful in. The modeled-amps-and-effects- on-the-floor category just gained a fierce new competitor. BOSS also expanded the popular line of 500-series pedals and showcased two new beauties, the RV 500 and MD 500 pedals. The RV 500 provides nearly two dozen reverb types, and if that isn\u2019t mind boggling in and of itself, it also allows for adding delay to the signal on a per patch, per channel basis, both in series or parallel. The MD 500 contains a history of modulation effects, and serves as an end-all pedal for guitarists seeking to add chorus, flanger, phaser, and any other type of modulation effect we can think of. With 12 modes and over two dozen effects, this modulation pedal is definitely not a one-trick pony.\u00a0\u2014BS The land down under got one over on everyone and snagged a NAMM 2018 Best In Show award, bringing their line of acoustic guitars featuring Australian-sourced woods which proved to be both beautifully resonant and stunningly beautiful. Their guitars feature a Spanish heel, in which the neck is one piece all the way to the soundhole and glued to the top, which is not common in modern guitar building. They also feature a pickup and electronics system designed to tune out some of the piezo shrillness, which is achieved using piezos in combination with a separate sensor as well as a condenser mic built into the instrument. They are lauding their electronics as the most natural pickup system in the industry.\u00a0\u2014BS It seems you can\u2019t be an amp manufacturer anymore without also offering a line of pedals. ENGL joins the fray with a series of pedals housed in rugged, brushed aluminum cases. The delay and reverb pedals keeps your dry tone completely analog, the delay offers both vintage and modern modes, and both feature true bypass (as do all of the pedals). Also worth considering: FullRange (boost), FuzzyHead-OD, and Alpha-Drive.\u00a0\u2014SK Android users rejoice, as Eventide showcased their new control app for Android devices. Mirroring the iOS version we\u2019ve been using for years, thousands of additional H9 users will now have access to this essential editor.The really big news from Eventide can be found in our Recording feature, where the new H9000 processor was unveiled. We know a few of you may be tempted to stick one of these in your guitar rig, but while it has the ability to make you sound like a guitar god, it\u2019s really not intended for such a trivial task (compared with the heavy lifting it\u2019s designed to handle). \u2014BS and SK Fender had a dizzying display this year, and on top of all the breathtaking guitars and amps, they released a new line of stompboxes! The Pugilist Distortion is designed to stack and blend two separate distortions to give players a perfect level of saturation, and the Santa Ana Overdrive is a FET-type stomp producing amp-like tones and feel. The Level Set Buffer is a long needed pedal in the industry, allowing players to swap out guitars during their performances and not radically alter levels. This one also features a silent tuner out jack, allowing for both silent or always active tuning. Next up was the Bends Compressor, offering classic four-knob compression as well as a blend knob, enabling players to blend in the original signal. Also offered up are a new Delay and Reverb pedal, and we plan to put this collection to the test in the studio shortly. Although Fender displayed an array of breathtaking Custom Shop one-offs, mere mortals can\u2019t afford those. But for a taste of something special, Fender also brought to the show their new Parallel Universe collection, a production line featuring some interesting, modern guitar mashups. We saw a Tele and a Jaguar with Strat headstocks, a Strat with a Tele headstock, and so on. Refreshing? Perhaps. These were different for sure. Fender has also updated the Hot Rod series of amps, and we took note of the Blues Jr. on display, which we\u2019re particularly fond of. Besides updated gain circuitry, Fender is now offering Celestion speakers on some models as opposed to their typical Eminence speakers. Eric johnson rocked the house and jazzed the house at separate events. The Fender room had one such event during NAMM hours, where Johnson played a few notes and talked about his new signature model, the first thinline, semi-hollowbody Stratocaster! The real cherry on top was seeing Johnson perform a set at a Fender-exclusive, limited-attendance event (after hours). We were lucky enough to get a ticket to this exclusive event, and it was an experience to remember. We think his new thinline Strat is a winner, too! \u2014BS Framus Guitars had a very impressive display this year, and we took note of a couple of their models. The organic, bare bones Phil XG goldtop, with one volume knob and a P90 pickup. This is the guitar that separates the men from the boys, boys! Also on display was a breathtaking William Duvall Talisman, decked out in a stellar high polish, AAA flame maple transparent Nirvana Black finish. Framus spares no expense with appointments, including Graph Tech locking tuners, Seymour Duncan pickups and Tonepros bridges. Framus also took the NAMM show by surprise, introducing a Phil XG guitar in their more economical, standard line of instruments. Still featuring premium appointments such as Seymour Duncan pickups, set neck construction, a graphite nut and straplocks, this is a working mans instrument sure to continue in their high end feel and appearance. -BS Nita Strauss, the blonde vixen gracing Alice Cooper's stage in recent memory, has been a heavy endorser of Ibanez guitars for a few years now and has reached the time honored plateau of a signature instrument in the hallowed likes of Andy Timmons, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Paul Gilbert. Following in the S series tradition, a maple top on a mahogany body, paired perfectly with an ebony board and the \u201cbeaten path\u201d inlay, which looks much like an EKG generated heartbeat. The guitar also features her signature DiMarzio\u00a0pickups in a 2 hum, 1 single configuration. For those of our readers who are looking to rock all night and party every day, there was the Paul Stanley 40th Anniversary extremely limited edition Iceman guitar on display. The PS1DM has been adorned with over a thousand rhinestones (would you really expect anything less?) it is being made in limited numbers with a MAP of 7,999.99. For those of us who can't afford a trip into space just yet, the PS 120 will get us into the Signature Paul Stanley Iceman guitar with many of the same features, including a bone nut, Abalone and acrylic inlays and set neck construction for about 1/10 of the money. There were many Paul Stanley models on display, including a vintage one or 2 behind a glass case. \u2014BS Kyle Rhodes has whipped up yet another hot boutique amp to add to his already impressive collection of high-powered, feature-packed, tube amplifiers. The new Juno amplifier is KSR\u2019s first amp built specifically around EL-34 power tubes, and this three-channel head had some British inspiration behind it, making it sound a bit more unique compared to its 6L6-based siblings in the product line. The Crunch and Lead channels are based on sounds from the Orthos amp, but modified to sound more like classic \u201880s hot-rodded Marshalls. The true-bypass effects loop is the same design as found in other KSR amps. \u2014SK Line 6 was showing off its new flagship effects-only floor based processor, the HX Effects. Offering a small enough footprint to be a good centerpiece to a reasonable sized pedalboard, it provides flexible routing capabilities as well as the ability to select up to nine effects at once. Also of noteworthy mention were several Variax guitars, including the shredtastic Stevic MacKay (Twelve Foot Ninja) artist-designed signature Variax Baritone guitar, not to mention the James Tyler models that have been with us for a few years already. \u2014BS and SK Lunastone, hot off of their WHIO win for the TrueOverDrive 1, released four new pedals. Not eager to take a winning format out of production, they smartly kept the exact same layout of their popular TrueOverDrive pedals but now offer Distortion, Red Fuzz, Smooth Drive, and Blue Drive pedals as well. Unlike the TrueOverDrive series, which sound like your amp grew a set of extra channels, the new pedals are more traditional distortion and boost pedals. We were treated to a great demo and sure enough, Red Fuzz delivered classic \u201860s fuzz, the Blue Drive definitely conjured up some blues mojo\u2026 you get the idea. And you can bet we\u2019ll explore all of these in depth soon.\u00a0\u2014BS and SK Mezzabarba releases the Skill combo, a 1x12, two-channel, fire breather modeled after their popular Mzero line of guitar amps. The Skill 1x12 Combo includes a proprietary foot switch with boost and bright switches, and an effects loop. Stay tuned for an in-depth product review of this one. Our friend and fellow serious musician Howie Simon, fresh off recording guitars for Jeff Scott Soto\u2019s new album, gave a stellar performance at Mezzabarba\u2019s booth using the Mzero Overdrive 100w halfstack. Shortly after, we spotted veteran shred guru George Lynch lighting up the showroom floor with the exact same head over at the Seymour Duncan booth.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014BS A few years ago, we reviewed some compact stomp boxes from Mooer, and they were showing off a greatly expanded product line at the NAMM Show. We like their Ocean Machine, a combination delay/reverb/looper pedal designed in collaboration with guitarist/songwriter Devin Townsend, and their Red Truck was a great multi-effects pedal that is similar to other fly-rig-type pedal options, but appears to be more fully featured than most. We\u2019ll be reviewing it shortly."

      "value": "Black Corporation surprised us with Deckard\u2019s Dream. To quote the website, \u201cDeckard\u2019s Dream is an 8-voice polyphonic analogue synthesizer inspired by a certain cinematic sound from the late 1970s and early 1980s.\u201d Black has essentially recreated the classic Yamaha CS-80 and fit it into three rack spaces (four if you count the optional expander). It sports eight-voice polyphony with two independent synthesizer layers per voice, with discrete waveshapers to help reproduce the oddities of the original waveforms. Autotune keeps all 16 VCOs tracking perfectly, but you can detune and microtune settings for a more vintage feel. With the addition of MIDI, 256 presets, an OLED display, and an upcoming software editor provided by Spektro Audio, this vintage recreation has become quite modern in its capabilities.The 1U rackmount expander provides 16 assignable CV inputs, analog ring-modulator and chorus, along with Sustain I/II controls. It may be also be used as a standalone effects box and a CV-to-MIDI converter. We were quite impressed by the sound, though the $3,749 price and three-month build time may hold some people off. Still, it\u2019s quite a bit cheaper and far more practical than owning an actual CS-80. And for those truly brave souls, a DIY kit is offered for less money as well. \u2014JB Korg introduced the Prologue, the next evolution of the analog Minilogue and Monologue lines. The two Prologue models offer 8-voices/49 keys and 16 voices/61 keys respectively. Both have 500 voices (250 preset and 250 user), four modes (poly, mono, unison, chord), the ability to split and layer, an arpeggiator, multiple, 32-bit digital effects, and two (small) screens including the Oscilloscope seen on the Monologue. Interestingly, KORG is providing a Prologue SDK (Software Development Kit) that allows developers to program, customize and extend the capabilities of the multi-engine and digital effects and is expected to be available for download in the spring of 2018. Our limited time with the synth at the show revealed great sounds and a great feeling keyboard. The 61-key model also features a VU meter that governs the analog compressor/booster. Korg also introduced the Volca Mix. The volca Mix is a four-channel analog performance mixer that lets you construct a live setup combining multiple Volca units. There are two mono inputs and a pair of stereo inputs, as well as DC connectors to power three other Volca units. There are three faders, a LO/HI CUT filter, gain control, and RCA stereo line outputs with a master volume LED VU. There\u2019s also a send/return jack for connection to an external effect unit. Finally, there\u2019s an analog sync jack which allows for tempo sync, as well as start/stop options. \u2014JB Native Instruments decided to make their foray into the sample market with the launch on Sounds.com. Currently, the reigning champion of sample packs and sounds for loop-based music creation is Splice. However, NI has made it clear it wants a share of the market, and at the price points they are advertising, Free or Pro ($9 a month), Splice is in for some serious competition! Not only is NI offering a great sample library, they also are offering a 50/50 split with sound providers. Additionally, they have created a software interface to use as a plug-in companion to sounds, so you can easily search while in a session to find the instrument or vibe needed. Although a new product category for NI, it seems they have done their homework and are poised to make a big impact. \u2014JL We were waiting eagerly to see an expanded, rackmount version of the popular Key Largo mixer-in-a-pedal, and the KL-8 was introduced. In this 1U mixer, you get: inputs for up to four stereo keyboards, and two USB computer audio interfaces (for failover between two computers). There\u2019s an insert loop for shared effects/processing, and separate mains and monitor outputs (transformer isolated XLR, of course). From the front panel, you can press a Cue button to pull any instrument out of the mains and monitors and send them straight to your headphones, useful for auditioning sounds and troubleshooting without interfering with your main output. It\u2019s also a MIDI interface for your computer and is built to typical Radial standards (tour-grade construction). A pair of stereo auxiliary connections are useful if you want to connect a few of these together, which may be necessary for anyone with a large keyboard rig. \u2014SK Roland Cloud continues to expand, and now includes full reproductions of the original TR-808 and TR-909 rhythm composers as VST and AU plugins. There was also a preview demonstration of the new SRX Orchestra virtual instrument, which should become available in a Roland Cloud update shortly. The SRX Orchestra is the first of Roland's famed SRX Expansion Library to be made available as an individual virtual instrument, and we\u2019re super excited about this. The SRX Orchestra complements the recent inclusion of a virtual JV-1080, bringing more of the distinctive sound of \u201890s-era Roland instruments to Roland Cloud. Roland hinted there will be other SRX reproductions, and our fingers are crossed in hopes for a virtual \u201cUltimate Keys\u201d SRX instrument. In the hardware department, most models remained unchanged from 2017. Roland was displaying their refreshed KC keyboard amplifier series, and we were impressed with the variety of models and love the compact models that can run off batteries and mount on a microphone stand, perfect for personal monitoring and impromptu barbeque gigs. We\u2019ll be taking an in-depth look and listen soon. \u2014JB Look out, mighty A-Frame! Your days are numbered based upon the fantastic new stands we saw coming out of the new Sequenz brand (a new line from KORG). The rugged and modern design leaves room for your pedals on the floor and provides multiple angle, width, and height adjustments. You can easily put three large keyboards on one of these stands in a compact arrangement. We\u2019ll be reviewing these shortly as we couldn\u2019t judge for ourselves how easily they set up/tear down for stage use. \u2014SK Perhaps the most intriguing synth we saw at NAMM was Waldorf\u2019s Quantum digital-analog polyphonic synth. Combining digital digital oscillators with analog filters, classic wavetables with new additions from the revered Nave synth (including speech synthesis and wavetable generation from audio), sampling, and an impressive high-resolution, multi-touch display results in a synth that really \u201cwowed\u201d us. Each parameter section has knobs highlighted by a specific colored LED, and when you turn any given knob, a large graph appears on the screen to show you not only what the parameter value is, but how you are affecting the shape of the element visually. Watching envelope shapes adjust on the fly as if working with a soft-synth provided a whole new level of visual feedback that we loved. There\u2019s a premium Fatar TP8, 61-key keybed that feels great, eight voice polyphony, 4GB of internal flash memory (preloaded with 1 GB sample data), effects, an arpeggiator, and external CV connectivity! There\u2019s a lot of horsepower to be discovered here, and while the finishing touches are still being tweaked, it sounded great already. We look forward to getting our hands on this one when it ships later this spring. Waldorf was also showing off the STVC synth as well. Essentially a string synthesizer with a vocoder, it is based upon Waldorf\u2019s Streichfett, which ironically had neither keys nor a vocoder. There are several sections: the string section starts with an oscillator bank using octave dividers, followed by a mixer, an equalizer and an ensemble effect, similar to string machines from the \u201870s. A single knob sweeps through mixer and EQ settings for Violin, Viola, Cello, Brass, Organ, Choir and more for creating rich and creamy sonic textures. The Solo section is a 16-voice synthesizer that complements the string sounds. The Vocoder replaces the equalizer in the string section with the filter bank that models the vocal tract from the speech input. This can produce quite intelligible speech or singing using the fully polyphonic oscillator bank. Formants can be modified, which can result in a perceived change of gender. Adjustable jitter of the string oscillators renders the voice hoarse, creaky or a complete whisper. Admittedly, we had fun at the booth playing with the vocoder, but overall this intriguing synth sounded very good as well.\u00a0\u2014JB Yamaha introduced us to the Genos workstation keyboard in a private event the week before NAMM. We were skeptical about it being a typical \u201carranger\u201d keyboard, but it has great sounds for writing, arranging, and orchestrating. The MSRP price of $6,799 is sure to frighten a few players, but given that the sound engine sports twice the processing power of the flagship Montage synth, you know you\u2019re in for a sonic heavyweight here. Sporting 76 keys, 500 preset styles, over 1,500 sounds, 1.8GB of user memory space, and two LCD displays, there\u2019s a lot of power on tap here, packaged behind an interface that appears to be far less complex than your typical workstation keyboard. While possibly useful to already-established (successful) composers, we wonder how many aspiring singer/songwriters will have the means to take advantage of this power. We\u2019ll be putting it to the test shortly, and will let you know more.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014JB and SK"

      "value": "Blackstar introduced a range of compact bass amps this year! The Unity amps are combos with a variety of power ratings and speaker options, all of which can be expanded with a matching, self-powered, 1x15 cabinet. The amps have selectable voicing options: classic, modern, and flat, and selectable dynamics response: linear, 6L6, and 6550. They each feature direct recording options, overdrive circuits, and compression, and have budget-friendly pricing putting them within easy reach of gigging bassists. \u2014SK What\u2019s a bass amplifier company without their signature sound in a preamp pedal? We got to check out GK\u2019s Plex Preamp pedal. Besides footswitchable overdrive and compression, the pedal includes the brand\u2019s iconic, active, four-band, \u201cVariable Q\u201d equalizer and contour circuit. It has an effects loop, XLR direct output (in addition to standard quarter-inch jacks), and a USB connection that provides direct recording capabilities! \u2014SK What\u2019s up, people? That would be the new Ibanez electric, upright bass! It was an interesting looking slab of wood to be sure, though it will be interesting to see if they can take a bite out of NS Design\u2019s supreme dominance in this instrument space. \u2014SK Lakeland introduced the new Ice Blue Skyline series at Winter NAMM. Available in four- and five-string variants with a variety of pickup options, we love the subdued metallic blue finishes with matching headstocks. You can order these basses with a huge variety of pickup configurations, colors, and tops if the cool blue finish isn't your thing. \u2014SK The new Bantam 4 bass has a chambered, alder body beneath its quilted maple top, and a short, 30\u201d scale length for its bolt-on, maple neck with Indian Rosewood fretboard. It\u2019s made in the Czech Republic and features a pair of EMG pickups (EMG35DC) with active EQ. We were also excited to check out Rudy Sarzo\u2019s signature bass, the Euro4 LX RS. It features the extremely versatile SimS pickups that were one of our NAMM top picks two years ago. We\u2019re hoping to getting our hands on this bass for review soon. \u2014SK With its retro-future vibe, it was hard not to love Warwick\u2019s new Idolmaker bass guitars. These 34\u201d scale four- and five-string instruments have bolt-on necks, strap locks, and offer a variety of active or passive pickups and electronics, different tops and woods, etc. The 2018 Limited Edition Streamer LX was another striking model, featuring a swamp ash body, wenge neck/fretboard, and passive Aquilar Soapbar DC-D2 pickups. \u2014SK"

      "value": "2018 marks Gretsch\u2019s 135th anniversary, and to celebrate they are offering a limited edition Broadcaster Series kit featuring three-ply shells consisting of two maple inner plies and one mahogany outer ply. New for Gretsch is their 301 single flange hoop, which is featured on this line of drums. Two finishes are available: Dark Emerald and Classic Mahogany. Interestingly, this year Gretsch is bringing back their own hardware, which they haven\u2019t manufactured since the 80s! Two series are offered: They heavy-duty G5 Series, and the lighter-duty G3 series. \u2014DG New for 2018 at the Istanbul booth, and spanning a wide variety of sound colors, are their Hamer line of cymbals consisting of\u00a0sixteen different models in the following sizes and configurations: 10\u201d splash, 15\u201d and 16\u201d hi hats, 16\u201d crash (three versions), 17\u201d crash (three versions), 18\u201d crash (three versions), 20\u201d crash/ride, 21\u201d dry ride, 22\u201d dry ride, and 22\u201d warm ride. Also new for 2018 are the 20 and 22\u201d Sterling rides, and the 22 and 23\u201d Agop rides. Finally, Hamer suspended crashes are offered as well in the following sizes: 17\u201d, 18\u201d, 19\u201d, and 20\u201d. We couldn\u2019t help but notice Ludwig displaying a new line of snare drums based on their coveted Black Beauty snare called Raw Brass. These snares essentially utilize the same raw material of the original Black Beauty, but without the nickel plating. They feature raw brass shells without a sealer, which gives them a raw organic look that will continue to change over time through oxidation. Tonally, they exhibited an appealing dry, more focused sound than the Black Beauty.\u00a0 \u2014DG Paiste definitely did not disappoint this year, offering a staggering array of new cymbals for 2018 including the PSTX Cajon edition 16\u201d crash designed for hand playing, as well as the new PSTX 12\u201d Cajon hi hats. In the same line are three new stacks in combos of 12/10\u201d and 10/8\u201d configured with brass top and bronze bottom cymbals. Rounding out the new cymbals in the PSTX line is the 20\u201d Swiss medium crash. Next up are the new highly responsive, fast decaying Masters Editions extra thin crashes offered in 18, 19, and 20\u201d sizes. Also new in the Masters Edition line of cymbals is the 22\u201d masters dark crash/ride and the 8 and 10\u201d dark splashes. And for something completely different, and were the obvious standouts for Paiste this year comes the new Masters dry and extra dry series of ride cymbals. Both versions are available in 20, 21, and 22\u201d sizes. \u2014DG Roland\u2019s TM-6 Pro Trigger Module could be just want many of today\u2019s modern drummers needs. Pair this module with some Roland triggers and you can accomplish many things: Augment your acoustic kit with electronic drum sounds, blend your acoustic sounds with sampled acoustic sounds, or ignore the crappy sounding house kit and carry your \u201cstandard\u201d acoustic drum sounds to any gig\u2014just throw your triggers on the backline kit and go! Manage and play backing tracks with your band! Export songs from your DAW along with a seperate export of the click track. The TM-6 will play both WAV files back in sync and let you route the click track to just yourself or to other audio outputs. Maybe the TM-6 Pro is still too big a step for you to take into the world of electronic drums? The new RT-MicS is a stand-alone trigger/sound module hybrid. Just clamp the device onto your snare drum or tom and choose from one of eight pre-loaded sounds ranging from snares to handclaps to percussive elements, or load your own samples into the device ahead of time. No additional hardware necessary. \u2014SK We were able to audition Sabian\u2019s new FRX line of cymbals for 2018, which should appeal to drummers that don\u2019t want to hold back in fear of drowning out other instruments on stage. These cymbals are designed to reduce mid and high frequencies without sacrificing tone, and while they are nowhere near as quiet as Zildjian\u2019s L80 low volume cymbals, we felt they, in fact, didn\u2019t compromise nearly as much in the tonal department. \u2014DG New for 2018 at the Sonor booth is their line of AQ2 drums. These kits expand upon their small sized compact kits, but offer upgraded all maple shells and many more sizes are available as well. For example, the bass drums start as small as 14\u201d in diameter, and go up to 22\u201d, opening up the possibility of combining many different playing situations from the same line of drums. Offered in four high gloss lacquer finishes, these kits are compatible with a wide variety of Sonor hardware as well, and each drum is available for purchase separately. \u2014DG Catching our attention at the trick booth was the new affordable line of VMT series drums, offering the same aluminum shells as their premium kits configured with a 13\u201d rack tom, 16\u201d floor tom, and 20 or 22\u201d bass drum. To cut down the price tag, this line of drums is limited to three finishes: black, blue, and white. Also, steel hoops are utilized on the bass drum instead of aluminum hoops, and powder coated lugs are not offered, even though the lugs are the same high quality versions found on their premium kits. The snare is an 8-lug model and is considered an optional extra. \u2014DG We were very impressed with what we were hearing at the Turkish booth, and the new Lale Kardes Signature Series cymbals were no exception. Designed to be a heavy rock cymbal, they produced an all-around raw, lower pitch, earthy tone while still maintaining brightness and good definition. Also new for this year were the Travel Series cymbals designed by Chris Wabich. This series of cymbals are perfect for the traveling drummer, easily inside roller luggage or underneath your seat. The set consists of 13\u201d medium hi hats, a 17\u201d medium thin crash, and a 16\u201d flat ride. We felt the hi hats projected very well for their size. The ride cymbal had great definition and could be used as a crash as well. The 17\u201d crash was pleasantly dark with a fast decay, and maintained enough definition to be used as a ride as well. \u2014DG Yamaha unveiled its new Tour Custom all-maple 6-ply shell kit. Sitting right in the middle of their entire line of drums, these relatively affordable kits were designed for the working drummer. Since the shells are are thinner than most of Yamaha\u2019s other drums, they are lighter in weight as well, providing the added bonus of more resonance and warmer tone from a lighter touch. These kits are offered in five natural satin finishes: Butterscotch Satin, Licorice Satin, Candy Apple Red Satin, Caramel Satin, and Chocolate Satin. Snares not included, they are sold in 4-piece configurations wit a 20 or 22\u201d bass drum, 10 and 12\u201d rack toms (13\u201d also available as an option), and 14 or 16\u201d floor tom. The EAD10 is an innovative solution for drummers who want to record themselves playing drums, whether for lessons, jamming along with favorite drum tracks, or who are simply trying to become the next YouTube video sensation. With zero complexity, a single sensor device mounts to your kick drum and picks up the sounds of your entire drum kit, relaying the data to the control module, which augments your kit with additional and/or enhanced sounds. The companion iOS app facilitates recording videos of your performances and uploading them to the web. This definitely simplifies the process of recording your performances, and it\u2019s both fun and effective, but no, it\u2019s not a replacement for proper miking on a studio recording. \u2014DG and SK"

      "value": "Hot on the heels of the Edge + Verge modeling microphone solution paired with the Discrete 4 and Discrete 8 preamps that we saw this past fall at the AES Show, Antelope unveiled the Edge Strip, a two-channel microphone preamp that comes bundled with an Edge modeling microphone for the studio. This is going to be hot, as it provides a very reasonably priced entry into the world of Antelope\u2019s outstanding hardware and mic modeling technology ($1,295). It\u2019s a fully analog solution, so you can integrate this into any studio setup with ease.\u00a0\u2014SK The new iD44 packs a lot of Audient power into a desktop USB-C recording interface with an equally compact price (under $700 street). The interface features four Audient class-A preamps (same circuit found in their ASP8024-HE console) and ADAT expandability, Word Clock output, and a pair of insert loops. On the front, you\u2019ll also find a pair of JFET DI inputs for instruments, and two independent headphone outs. This is a ton of capability in a desktop unit, and that doesn\u2019t even count some of the advanced operational features like mono summing, polarity and phase selection, and talkback!\u00a0\u2014SK Avid introduced Pro Tools 2018 with enhanced MIDI features including MIDI Retrospective, so when you are noodling around\u2014even if not recording\u2014it remembers what you did! This a fabulous enhancement that promotes creativity. Additionally, MIDI Transpose is much easier with new key commands (simple up and down directions\u2014Yes!) and adding Shift to the command transposes by an octave. Lastly, there is a new Chord Extract feature that learns from you while playing melodies. Other new features include Target Playlists to make comping quicker and simpler, and also new Track Presets, through which favorite plug-in chains can be easily recalled and added. On a different note, Avid launched the WeR4music campaign to hopefully pressure lawmakers into awareness of the pay gap between providers such as Spotify, record labels, and artists, who currently have the short end of this equation. Whether or not better legislation and compensation will result remains to be seen, but at least they are trying.\u00a0\u2014JL Thomas Barefoot has continued the trend set last year of releasing products for the lower budget market (depending on your perspective). Specifically, Barefoot has upped the ante for smaller studios and serious home recording enthusiasts providing a stereo sub pair to the Micromain 45 nearfield monitor. This new Dual Sub add-on for the Micromain 45 is priced at around $3,495, and provides current 45 owners a taste of the Flagship Mini Main 12 (retail approximately $25,000) for a fraction of the cost. The Micro Sub provides Dual Force technology to the 45 (the only barefoot model without it) showing a clear path of upgradability to would-be users. Adding this set gives the 45 extension down to 25Hz and has a crossover point of 80Hz; relieving the 45\u2019s of that work, which results in a cleaner mid and top end.\u00a0\u2014JL We first took note of the new H9000 processor at this past Fall\u2019s AES Show, and we\u2019ve got to tell you\u2026 you may want to tie your jaw strap on\u2014Jacob Marley style, because this new unit is not only jaw dropping, it is also mind blowing! Eventide has been known for its hardware legacy for over 40 years, and we\u2019re huge fans of their Anthology X and XI (plug-in versions of their classic gear). Some people thought that Eventide had ceded the days of groundbreaking hardware to the past and was focused on a contemporary software approach only. With the release of the new H9000, though, that theory has been blown completely out of the water and into the annals of history. This thing is packed with surround-capable effects processing and multiple I/O capabilities including Analog and digital as well as Ethernet, MADI, and more. The H9000 can process up to 16 seperate channels of FX simultaneously, so you\u2019re not just limited to cool stuff on one channel or a mix buss, but multiple channels at the same time. Translation: meet your new Daddy! It seems Eventide has made a statement that it will be the undisputed King of FX processing in the high-end audio world, not to mention creative sound effects leader. Because the algorithms used, processing power, and customization abilities contained within the H9000, once again, when people hear new records with sounds they have never heard before and ask \u201cHow did they do that?\u201c Eventide will be the resounding answer. Eventide is offering the H9000 as 2U rack unit with full front panel control for $6,999, or a blank rack box controlled entirely via software only for $4,999. Stay tuned, because as soon as we can get our hands on a production unit, we will review it\u2014and hopefully mix many new hit records!\u00a0\u2014JL New for 2018 at the Manley booth were the Elop+ and NuMu compressors, both of which follow a new streamlined manufacturing process they have been hard at work on. The new Elop+ electro-optical compressor replaces the original Elop, and like the NuMu, features a new advanced, low-radiating power supply, contributing to a very low noise floor from these units. Included now in the new Elop+ is a ratio button, which offers both 3:1 compression and 10:1 limiting, and also adds transformerless output, unlike the original Elop. Also foregoing output transformers, the NuMu is a modern take on the classic Variable Mu, imposing less of a \"footprint\" on the audio. It is a more transparent, cleaner, discrete FET design utilizing high voltage transistors. \u2014DG MXL introduced the POP LSM-9 microphone. Available in Blue, Magenta, Yellow, and Green, it is a super cardioid mic with a dynamic capsule, with a dynamic range of 50Hz -18kHz. It is designed for live vocal performances and is reported to minimize handling noise. All-metal construction points to as much durability as the next popular stage microphone. We only wished there was a fire engine red offering, as the magenta seems to lean a bit more towards pink.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014JB We had to throw the venerable drum company in here or else engineers would have no idea that the drums hardware guys at Tama turned their attention to a line of stands that are pro-studio-worthy at home-studio prices! (their Titan drum hardware is already legendary for ruggedness). The Iron Works Studio line has weighted bases, tripod legs cast from solid iron, and multi-steel-plate compression cinches for their booms. There\u2019s quite a bit of attention paid to the details, and whether you need better stands for miking a drum kit or to hold your vocal mics in the studio, these stands pack great value and should be checked out.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014SK One of the big hits from this year\u2019s NAMM Show had to be the UA Ox Amp Top Box.In this compact, vintage-styled unit, UA delivers a reactive load box combined with a direct recording solution that models popular microphones and speaker cabinets while also enabling you to play your guitar amp at any volume. Unlike other solutions that rely upon impulse responses (IRs), UA has taken a speaker modeling approach instead. Initial indications from some of our friends who already raced out to purchase this suggest that the Ox sounds great, while we\u2019re impressed by the apparent ease-of-use that may prove to be the most distinguishing feature of this solution. We\u2019ll be reviewing it soon enough and will let you know how it fares compared with similar solutions. UA also introduced the Arrow, their most affordable, desktop recording interface yet. This straightforward interface features a bus-powered Thunderbolt 3 interface compatible with both Mac OS X and Windows 10, 24-bit/192kHz converters, one instrument input, and two mic/line preamps/inputs. It includes the UA Realtime Analog Classics plug-in collection to get you started.\u00a0\u2014SK One of the rising stars within the audio industry is Warm Audio. They have consistently delivered phenomenal re-creations of legendary vintage gear at unheard of pricing for a few years now, and they continue that trend this year."

      "value": "While pondering the purchase of his next Strat, a man with 22 Stratocasters is asked by his wife, \u201cHow many Strats are too many?\u201d To which he replies, \u201c23?\u201d Obviously, one can never have too many Stratocasters. And every year, Fender Stratocaster fans eagerly await the release of a new Fender American Standard Stratocaster in anticipation of some changes from previous years that place them in the \u201cmust add to my collection\u201d category. Usually, the changes are subtle. However, 2017 marked a larger change for Fender. Recognizing it was time to refresh the Stratocaster line, The American Standard series was retired and replaced by the Professional Series. The first question Stratocaster fans are asking is whether there are significant changes, or is this just a way to give it a fancier name and charge more? In short, the Professional series does present changes in the Strat that influence both tone and performance. The challenge for a company like Fender is to stay relevant with new generations of guitar players while continuing to appeal to seasoned fans. How do you make a $1,500 guitar appealing and worth the price difference from less costly models? Special features like modifiable sound cards and automatic tuners have been seen more as gimmicks rather than true upgraded features, so you\u2019re left with shuffling around the core components and specs. If Fender over-modernizes the Strat, they risk making it unappealing to Strat aficionados. If they make it too vintage, younger players will turn away. Overall, Fender has done a nice job upgrading its American Standard line to the new Professional series. Do the new features justify the price increase over the American Standard line? That\u2019s hard to say. Bone nuts (one new feature) are not really costlier, while adding a treble bleed circuit costs perhaps a few dollars at worst. Changing the neck shape, pickups, and tremolo pop-in arm are a bit more involved, though. Whatever the case, this guitar is stage and studio ready, and sure to appeal to a broad range of players while continuing to deliver classic Stratocaster tone. The primary features that differentiate the new American Professional series from the former American Standard series include the following updates: The Stratocaster we reviewed featured a glossy, piano black body with a slightly tinted (not yellow) maple neck and fretboard. The back of the neck is covered in a matte satin urethane finish while the fretboard is covered in glossy urethane. The 22 frets have been changed from medium-jumbo to narrow-tall to improve bending and fretting chords higher up on the neck. The alder wood body (a common Fender body choice) is covered in gloss polyurethane. The headstock and badge are modern Stratocaster size, not the larger, vintage, \u201870s style. The tuners remain unchanged, a staggered modern style with a modern style string tree. The neck is a standard 25.5\u201d scale as found on most Stratocaster models, with a 9.5\u201d radius, but has a new, \u201cDeep C\u201d shape. The \u201cDeep C\u201d thickness is 0.82\u2019\u201d at the first fret and 0.920\u201d at the 12th fret, but dimensions can vary slightly. The neck heel is a standard, four-hole, rectangular design. The truss rod is unchanged and continues to be a bi-flex dual adjust. This is a Fender exclusive that can correct not just concave neck bowing (like a single-action truss rod) but also correct for convex neck bowing. This feature has only been available on certain Fender models, and now it makes its way down the line into a standard production model. The pickups are new this year and have been changed from the custom shop, single-coil Stratocaster pickups on the Standard line to a new, Tim Shaw-designed, V-mod, single-coil pickup. The development and research behind the new pickups is well discussed on the Fender website . Tim Shaw (guitar pickup guru) stated, \u201cThe first challenge was to do something different but not mess it up.\u201d Fender combined different magnets to produce a \u201cmusically interesting and useful tone.\u201d Shaw states, \u201cThey adjusted the winding and stuff to get the maximum versatility\u201d out of the guitar \u201cwhile keeping the characteristics that everybody knew and liked about them.\u201d With the American Professional Stratocaster, all three single-coil pickups vary, with a blend of alnico II and III for the bridge, alnico II and V for the middle, and alnico V for the bridge. The poles on the pickups are vintage staggered. There are many discussions of this design decision online and whether it is appropriate for modern day fretboards that aren\u2019t sporting a vintage 7.25\u201d radius. Another enhancement is the treble-bleed circuit, which compensates for the familiar loss of treble tone when rolling back the volume control. There is a standard, five-position blade switch for pickup selection, along with a volume knob and two tone knobs. The pop-in tremolo arm was upgraded for enhanced stability. Often, there is a challenge finding that right balance of the arm being too loose or too tight. The pop-in style solves this problem by utilizing an arm tension adjustment to set just the right swing in the arm. The bridge is a standard American, two-point design, and the bridge saddles are vintage bent steel. The case that comes with the guitar is Fender\u2019s Elite Molded Case. It features upgraded latches compared to previous models, is supposedly more durable for travel than classic hard cases, and has TSA compliant locks. The American Professional Strat was perfectly set-up right out of the box. After tuning it up and stretching the strings, the guitar played very well. The guitar immediately felt durable and properly balanced off the shoulder as with typical Fender Strats. One thing that we always feel that should differentiate an American-made guitar from a less expensive foreign made one is that it should come with perfect frets and require little set-up. The guitar that we reviewed had well-dressed, rounded fret edges with no sharp edges, near perfect intonation, and the neck had just the right amount of bow. The back of the neck was covered in a matte satin urethane finish that made moving along the neck clean and smooth. The fretboard was covered in a thick glossy urethane, which we found less desirable as it could sometimes feel sticky under hand when bending notes. However, the new, narrow-tall frets counteract this a bit to make bending notes easier than on the previous series Strat. The nut was upgraded to genuine bone vs. synthetic bone as found on the outgoing American Standard guitars. Some claim this improves tone as bone\u2019s higher density transfers vibration better for increased resonance of the guitar, but any theoretical difference went unnoticed by us in real-world playing. The tuners seemed smooth and once the strings stabilized, the guitar stayed in tune well. The new, \u201cDeep C\u201d neck shape offers a nice refinement, and it feels like a happy meeting point between Fender\u2019s modern C and D shapes. The slight change seemed more comfortable in our hands, particularly at the 12th fret and above, and there was no fret buzz nor fretting out with aggressive bending. Having a Strat\u2019s whammy bar stay in position (courtesy of the adjustable collar) while not being too tight was a joy. Even after minutes of use, the guitar stayed in tune. You probably won\u2019t be doing Van Halen dive bombs with it, but for most whammy bar use, the guitar was able to keep up. One other key difference we noticed was the resistance of the pots for volume and tone control. Depending on your playing style, it can be easy to hit the volume or tone knobs and have them move while playing. No longer! These pots seemed to have just the right amount of resistance, avoiding being too loose, while also not being too tough. The guitar does appear to be a little bit of a hodgepodge of modern and vintage styles. The pickup covers and volume and tone knobs are tinted, and there are vintage bent-steel bridge saddles. We think a vintage style string tree and tuners would fit better with the overall vibe of the guitar given those design choices, but the combination certainly works from a functionality perspective. Feeling how the sound of an unplugged electric guitar resonates through your bones acoustically sets the stage for what you should expect once plugged in. This particular guitar we reviewed sounded fantastic acoustically. It had great resonance. Whether that\u2019s in part due to the real bone nut or the light weight of this Strat body is hard to say. Now of course all of this doesn\u2019t matter if a Strat doesn\u2019t sound like a Strat. Most guitarists looking for a Stratocaster are looking for the glassy clean sound, powerful blues tone, and all-out rock belt. You\u2019ll notice from the pickup diagram above that the bridge pickup is the only one of the three without a blended magnet. It is pure AlniCo \u00a05, which is supposed to be punchy and bold, but we felt that it came across a bit harsh, one of the familiar critiques of Strat bridge-position pickups. However, rolling off the tone control improved the tone quite a bit and made the first pickup position more usable. The rest of the pickups delivered expected Strat tones, but lacked a bit of the expected glassiness. Putting a Creative Audio Labs Redeemer buffer in the circuit before our guitar cable definitely improved the tone and enhanced the sound of the pickups. These are not noiseless pickups. In positions 2 and 4, you get the expected out-of-phase tones that are noiseless, but positions 1, 3, and 5 present typical, modern single-coil noise, which is to say, they\u2019re not as noisy as your father\u2019s Strat, but the noise is still present. If you desire classic Fender Stratocaster tone with all the sparkle and none of the noise, check out the , which features the fourth-generation noiseless pickups (reviewed here). We started testing the guitar on a Supro Dual-Tone amp. The combination of a Stratocaster and a Dual-Tone gives way to some classic tones. The amp really thrives when cranked all the way, giving a fat but clean and punchy crunch. Since this guitar has a treble bleed circuit, it\u2019s a perfect candidate to have the amp cranked and the guitar volume knob rolled down. There are many discussions about upsides and downsides of treble bleed but it is a great (and inexpensive) mod that makes the volume control more usable. Although many guitarists leave the volume knob set at 10 all the time, adjusting it can broaden the range of capabilities of the guitar. The treble bleed mod really made use of the volume knob a pleasure for more than classic volume swells. In all positions, the guitar thrived with this amp, but did seem to lack some of the glassy Strat character we desired. Next, we played it through a Blackstar HT Studio 20 with a Weber Blue Dog speaker. This amp is very versatile and can be used to get clean, glassy, Fender tones as well as full blown, rockin\u2019 Marshall-like distortion. On the clean channel, we were able to get classic Strat tones, but again, lacked some of the glassiness. But on the dirty channel, we felt there was a certain muddiness trying to play high-gain, distorted tones. Rolling back the tone knobs on the guitar helped a bit. This was particularly noticeable when we tried various distortion/overdrive pedals. Rolling back the tone control with the bridge pickup can help achieve a more humbucker-type tone and reduce and/or eliminate most of the harshness typically found with the bridge pickup on a Strat. We did find that rolling back the tone knob all the way to get that Clapton \u201cWoman tone\u201d (he wasn\u2019t using Stratocasters for most recordings back then) resulted in too muddy of a tone, and the tone knob was not useful below 3. Cranking the distortion all the way up on the amp without pedals, the lower output of this bridge pickup couldn\u2019t drive the amp hard enough to achieve our desired hard rock/modern high gain tone, where a humbucker or hotter single coil pickup would typically be preferred. We also tested the new Strat with apps on our iPad using an Apogee Jam interface. Interestingly, all the pickup positions were very quiet. So if you are using the guitar straight into an interface on your computer or mobile device, you may find the pickups to be beautifully quiet across all positions. We had no trouble getting excellent hard rock/high gain tones, and rolling down the tone knob to 6-7 on the bridge pick-up really helped reduce the harshness. Our results varied across the different amps, more so than the consistency we\u2019ve achieved with the numerous other Fender Strats in our collection. The Fender website is a comprehensive resource for most things that are needed including videos for set-up, intonation, truss rod adjustment, etc. There is also a very general manual in English and Spanish that covers warranty information. However, only the Spanish part of our manual included any setup information. The guitar comes with a certificate of authenticity. There are two Allen wrenches for truss rod and bridge saddle height adjustments. This Fender American Professional model sells for $1,399.99, while certain finishes and wood choices sell for $50 to $100 more. There are also HSS and an HH configured models at similar price points, useful if you\u2019re seeking to play a new Strat in high-gain settings.

      "value": "When it comes to choosing a drum kit, one drummer\u2019s preference may differ radically from the next drummer. Some may place a high priority on brand recognition and popularity/use by favorite drummer, while others focus on build quality, finish, and other factors. Others may associate a particular sound with a specific model or even an entire brand, and place higher priority on that aspect before making a buying decision. And then there is that smaller, select group of drummers who dare to be different and favor modern, cutting-edge \u00a0designs unique to a specific, boutique drum manufacturer. Trick Drums is synonymous with innovation, the company best known for its state-of-the-art pedal designs, headed by pioneer, Mike Dorfman. Located in Arlington Heights, Illinois, Trick has been producing some of the most groundbreaking and unique drumming products on the planet for over 25 years now, not the least of which are drums constructed from non-wood materials such as aluminum, as is the case with the custom kit in review. Even though Trick drums do not share the same popularity as their pedals, their design is definitely no less innovative. All Trick drum shells are made entirely of aircraft-grade, AL13, 3mm aluminum utilizing Trick\u2019s own proprietary alloy, grade, and heat treating process. Dorfman realized early on that a properly manufactured aluminum drum shell provides quite a few advantages over wooden drum shells. Namely, repeatable and unsurpassed consistency from shell to shell, for one. This results in near-perfect matching between drums within a single drum kit or across multiple drum kits manufactured at different time periods. Completely absent is the problem of one drum not sounding quite as good as the other drums within or across kits. Next, AL13 aluminum is stronger than wood, and Trick\u2019s proprietary version is no exception. Unlike wood, it is also impervious to weather and resists warping and cracking in extreme weather conditions. There is much less to worry about if these drums get rained on or end up sitting in a blazing hot or freezing cold vehicle. Another advantage of aluminum is that it affords a much wider variety of finishing options compared to wood. For example, Trick recommends and defaults to powder coating their drums, as this is by far the preferred method of decorating an aluminum drum shell. A powder coated finish on an aluminum drum shell offers many advantages over any other type of finish by comparison. Powder coating adheres to aluminum much better than paint to wood, and essentially bonds to the metal, becoming part of the end product itself. Unlike paint, a powder coating will move and conform to the metal and not crack if the metal is formed into a different shape after it is coated. Powder coating also resists fading and handles heavy impacts better than paint, stain, lacquers, and other types of coatings and finishes commonly found on wood drums. Keep in mind that powder coating does not imply a \u201cpowdered look.\u201d The same amount of gloss, depth, and shine found in other finishes is attainable with a powder coated finish as well. Finally, powder coating is much more environment-friendly. Compared to paint, there is virtually no waste if the overspray is reclaimed/re-used, which is very manageable during the powder coating process. With paint, approximately 50% of the product is wasted during application through evaporation, and none of the overspray can be reclaimed. Furthermore, wet paint typically contains solvents and/or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have been proven to be harmful to the environment, and need to be disposed of properly. Any powder coating overspray that is not used can be thrown safely into a landfill. Hardware-wise, Trick manufactures their own high-end lugs to compliment their unique drum shells, machined from solid aluminum. The threads to accommodate the tension rods are then drilled directly into lug itself, resulting in a single-piece lug that is stronger and sturdier than a die-cast lug or one that has a separate threaded insert. Since the lug is one solid piece, there is no chance of rattling happening from the lug during a performance as well. For example, if you were to remove the resonant head and rim from any drum, the lugs will produce no rattling, unlike many lugs that contain an insert\u2014which would no longer be stabilized from a removed tension rod. In addition to 45-degree bearing edges on all shells, another essential design component and contributor to the overall tone of any drum are the drum hoops. Trick utilizes 2.3mm, triple-flanged hoops for all toms, and solid aluminum hoops for the bass drum; the same proprietary AL13 formula used in the manufacture of their drum shells. For tuning the bass drum, round tuning knobs were chosen over the typical T-rod variety. Finally, heavy steel spurs keep the drum firmly situated on the floor. For tom mounting, Trick provides two options: Surface-mounted steel mounts, or their own 360-degree mounts purported to provide increased resonance. Like most drum manufacturers, Trick features a single vent hole for their toms. However, the venting strategy for the bass drum is much different: multiple thin, elongated slots are utilized around the circumference of the drum near both bearing edges. Finally, to finish off the drums, a newly designed solid aluminum badge is applied to each shell. However, only one badge is applied to the shell, so be sure to specify what side of the drum mount you want the badge placed. Two badges may be applied to the drum shell at an additional cost."

To better illustrate the improvements, here is a table comparing the iRig Mic HD and the new iRig Mic HD2: The mic comes with detachable cables, to allow you to connect to either an iOS device or a computer; Android users require an additional micro-USB adapter. The new mic sports a headphone jack at the base of the unit, and two controls: one for headphone volume and the other for input gain. Above these controls is a multicolor LED to show audio status (blue/green/amber), which is a nice touch to help you find a good recording level. Finally, the mic is completely bus-powered by whatever it is connected to\u2014no batteries required. To round it out, the mic includes a carry bag, a table-top stand, and a 5/8 inch to 3/8 inch thread adaptor to allow the mic to be mounted on both the included stand or a standard mic stand. The apps present an interesting collection. For iOS devices, you get a MicPack for use within Vocalive (a multi-track recording app sold separately), a Pro Bundle (of effects) for use within iRig Recorder (audio and video recording app also available separately), and Mic Room, which is a mic modeling program. There are the ubiquitous in-app purchase options to expand your mic collection, but included are familiar friends, such as models of the Shure SM57, Shure SM58, Neuman U87, and even a telephone mic, to name a few. We have explored these apps before, but we will review them briefly here: The full version of VocaLive gave us access to all effects including a suite of five dedicated, real-time vocal effects (pitch correction, choir harmonizer, voice doubler, vocalmorpher and de-esser) plus seven effects tailored to vocal processing (reverb, EQ, compressor, delay, envelope filter, chorus, phaser). The numerous effects can be combined to form a three-effects vocal chain. VocaLive also includes a number of presets to help you get started. The iRig mic and VocaLive were rather simple to use\u2014and definitely fun. All the effects sounded good, and the harmonizer worked better than expected. If you want your vocals to sound like an alien, the morph effect works great! We also liked the \"glam\" preset which gave the input voice a Queen/Bohemian Rhapsody sound. It was an unexpected (and pleasant) surprise to find vocal warm-up exercises built into the app. We could change keys chromatically and alter the tempo. Vocalists will really appreciate this feature. Of course, the focus of VocaLive for the iRig Mic is live, real-time use, and we think it does this quite well. However, an iPhone's screen size is a limiting factor for overall usability in the field, at least for some users. However, the iKlip mini helps facilitate this, allowing you to clamp your phone to a mic stand. To make the iRig's software use clearer, think about it like this: you have an iPhone with iRig Mic/VocaLive on a mic stand on stage. The output of the iPhone goes to the mixing board and PA. Since you can set up your own custom presets, let's say you make Preset 1 a chorus plus one octave below harmonizing (say, for verses, similar to a U2 effect). Then, you set up Preset 2 with harmonizing at the 3rd, 5th, and octave above (for a full chorus sound). In real-time, the lead singer can just touch the screen and toggle these effects between verse and choruses. It doesn't get much easier than this! For another song, you might create presets that toggle between distorted/morphing effects and clean vocals. This is a really easy way to add some creative effects to your live performance, assuming you like the sound of the actual iRig Mic vs. your \"standard\" vocal mic. The other app is free software, iRig Recorder. This is a neat little program for on-the-fly recording: interviews, podcasts, etc. Although the free version's capabilities are pretty basic, for just $4.99 you can purchase the full processing suite, which transforms iRig Recorder into a very competent, pro-level application. The full app allows you to cut/crop/loop your recordings (using a graphical waveform editor), and process your audio files including optimizing volume, tone, pitch shifting, speeding up or down without affecting pitch, brightening, and smoothing. Further, iRig Recorder has the ability to transfer files via e-mail, WiFi, or iTunes File Sharing, as well as a large selection of online services and social media like Airdrop, Messages, SoundCloud, Facebook, WhatsApp, DropBox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive. It also exports files as compressed .m4a or uncompressed .wav files. Recording time is limited only by the memory on your recording device, so even with 32 GB and 64 GB iOS devices, this should be plenty to get someone through the day. This could be very hand for journalists, as they don't need to pack an MP3 recorder in addition to their cell phone. We highly recommend the full app if you need to make recordings on location, though. iRig Recorder 3 is fully\u00a0Audiobus and\u00a0Inter-App Audio\u00a0compatible. While iRig Recorder can be used for recording musical performances, though, the one limiting factor is that this microphone is a monophonic audio device. Moving on to the Mac/PC side, there's a version of the Mic Room, T-RackS CS Classic, and Abelton Live 9 Lite included. Just to clarify, T-RackS is a great suite of various audio processing plug-ins that IK Multimedia has marketed for quite some time (and will shortly release version 5), and the Mic Room is an \"effect\" with this suite. Once you register your iRig Mic HD 2, the IK Multimedia account you created will allow you to download the software's fuller versions and give access to T-RackS. It took a bit to understand this, but the message is simple: register your mic, then download the goodies! In use, we liked the feel of the iRig Mic HD2. It felt sturdy, almost heavier than expected, but good to hold. We liked the sound of the mic, and handling noise was minimal. The one thing we didn't like\u2014which we have mentioned regarding other IK Multimedia products\u2014is that the volume dials are flush with the microphone. While we understand they shouldn't be jutting out so they accidentally get moved while recording or performing, they are hard to adjust without a bit of fiddling. Certainly, you could make the argument these are \"set and forget\" controls, but we still think it should be a little easier to adjust these. Other than this minor detail, we did like the overall performance of the mic. All in all, IK Multimedia has made a good sounding mic even better, and it's quite flexible for a variety of applications. The included apps should get anyone started regardless of device or platform, and the modeling software, while outside of the scope of this review, should open a whole palette of colors to choose from. At $129 USD, we think this is a great deal for all that is included. IK Multimedia"

      "value": "Let\u2019s face it\u2014drummers are no strangers to back and spinal issues. Long hours behind the kit often result in chronic, even debilitating back pain that can last a lifetime and sometimes result in an early end to a thriving musical career. The Motion-Pro Drum Throne seeks to address spinal issues that result from the physical stress of drumming. The spring-loaded, split-seat design allows greater freedom of movement of the pelvis in an effort to combat the issues created by traditional drum thrones. This split-seat design is a difference that bicyclists have benefited from for decades to eliminate pain points on the road and trail, and it\u2019s only just recently that a similar concept has been applied to our seated musical performance. Before we explore the details, we\u2019ll start by saying that this seat feels great and makes a real difference worth experiencing. Science or not, it\u2019s a well-crafted, comfortable throne that will keep your bottom happy for extended music sessions and world tours. The unique, patented design claims to reduce stress and compression of the spine during playing, which can only be a good thing. Richard Robertshaw, D.C., a San Francisco-based chiropractor and Spinal-Glide\u2019s founder, first developed and patented an office chair design utilizing a split down the middle, which he says \u201c...allows the coccyx to hang rather than touch the seat, thereby eliminating compression of the lumbar spine.\u201d In response to inquiries from pain-riddled drummers, he developed the Motion-Pro Drum Throne, which he asserts should result in reduced back pain and strain. As drum thrones go, this one's construction is certainly unique. While traditional thrones are comprised of upholstery stapled to a one-piece plywood base, to which a mounting plate is attached, the Motion-Pro is comprised of two individually constructed halves suspended on a quarter-inch thick, aluminum plate via eight heavy-duty coil springs (four per half). Finally, the mounting plate is attached to the bottom of the aluminum plate and accepts the post from a standard drum throne tripod. Our test seat arrived ready to go, with a high-end Drum Workshop-supplied, cast base. We used our own drum seat tripods to check the seat out. The DW base fits standard seat posts and has a secure clamp-style attachment, rather than a setscrew. In order to truly experience the difference, a quick test in the studio wouldn\u2019t suffice. So, we gigged several times a week for several months using this throne exclusively. The quality cushioning felt as good six months later as it did when we first put the seat to use. The heavy springs showed no signs of fatigue. Similarly, the black finish on both the springs and the base plate held up extremely well, with no flaking and minimal chipping. The plate itself held strong, with no cracks or signs of distortion. The entire assembly endured lots of \u201cbouncing drummer butt,\u201d being tossed into the backs of cars, dropped on the ground, as well as a bit of (grand)standing from time to time. The vinyl upholstery resisted dents and scuffs extremely well, despite being treated, well, like a piece of drum gear. The Motion-Pro Drum Throne was obviously manufactured to withstand professional use and abuse. We should also point out that while the Motion-Pro Drum Throne uses springs to absorb shock and allow movement, it flexes without bouncing. This is important for those who have a difficult time using a throne that moves while you're sitting on it, such as those with hydraulic lifting mechanisms. It absorbed shock and allowed for pelvic rotation without any noticeable bounce (at least not for drummers under 200 pounds). The only drawback to the design of the Motion-Pro Drum Throne\u2014for some drummers\u2014is its height. When compared to standard thrones, we found that the Motion-Pro sits more than two inches higher than comparable seats (in part due to DW\u2019s tall mounting plate). Shorter drummers, or those who like to sit very low, may have difficulty adjusting their seat low enough behind the kit. Given the quality and usefulness of this product, we would encourage Spinal-Glide Drum Thrones to offer a custom-designed, short-height tripod base to accommodate drummers who require a shorter seat height. Tipping the scales at nine pounds, seven ounces, the Motion-Pro Drum Throne weighs about 2.5 pounds more than\u00a0typical thrones. Did it help our backs? That\u2019s the question you\u2019ve been waiting for us to address, and it\u2019s hard to say for sure. But there was a definite difference in seat feel. The Motion-Pro Drum Throne felt very comfortable and returning to a conventional throne after six hard-hitting months was a real disappointment. The traditional, one-piece seating area seemed hard and unforgiving, whereas the Motion-Pro \u201cflows\u201d with your pelvis as you rock and roll behind the kit. When switching back to our classic seat, we really felt like we were taking a step backward (and thus intend to purchase one of these seats). The science behind the seat is sound, as split-seat designs\u00a0are only a new thing in the world of drumming. But it\u2019s more than just the split seat at work here, too, as the coil platform really makes the seat work with you, instead of being something you\u2019re simply resting your bottom (and pressure points) on. The Motion-Pro Drum Throne is a professional quality seat that should last for many years. With a starting price tag of $219.00 (more for custom fabrics/patterns), it\u2019s a bit pricey compared with traditional seats, but we see it as a worthwhile investment for drummers who are in it for the long haul. If you\u2019re an older drummer already experiencing back issues behind the kit, this is definitely an investment that we\u2019d recommend trying. Spinal-Glide Drum Thrones"

      "value": "If you\u2019ve watched , you probably wish you could get your hands on an Everlasting Gobstopper\u2014the candy that never loses its flavor. But of course, that\u2019s just too good to be true. Besides, how could Wonka stay in business if his product lasted forever? It seems Evans still believes in a world of pure imagination, as its engineers have blasted through the glass ceiling of current mylar drumhead design with another innovation: the UV1. Made of 10-mil thick, single-ply film, the UV1 is a \u201cmid-duty\u201d head, similar in construction to Evans\u2019 coated G1 series or the venerable Remo Coated Ambassador. However, it would be fair to say that the comparisons stop there because the UV1 truly is a showstopper in the world of drumheads. Without reading further, we\u2019ll cut right to the chase: these heads are so long-lasting, with familiar Evans tone and response, that we can\u2019t understand why anyone would purposely choose to purchase the coated G1 heads any longer. Get these and you\u2019ll have everything you love about the G1 heads\u2026 but you\u2019ll be purchasing new ones far less often. And we mean far less often... This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen innovation from Evans. They pioneered the use of synthetic material (polyester) for drumheads. And with more recent innovations like the EMAD bass drumhead series, Level 360 construction, and the new UV1 series, it\u2019s easy to understand why so many drummers are die-hard fans. Evans appears to have made a quantum leap with the UV1 series, with a head material and patented UV-cured coating that proposes to surpass all that have come before it in terms of overall durability without sacrificing sound quality. In fact, Evans claims that the new head material and coating process sounds than its predecessors. What\u2019s different about these heads? For one thing, the coating is \u201cUV cured.\u201d This means that instead of air drying (like paint), the coating is exposed to ultraviolet light and \u201ccured,\u201d much like numerous high-tech coatings ranging from state-of-the-art automotive paints to tooth fillings. In addition to speeding up the manufacturing process, this type of coating, which is applied via a silkscreen, is much more durable than traditionally-applied head coatings, which are sprayed on and dried by air. UV1 heads utilize the Level 360 system, which features a steeper collar with an improved angle/radius for a better fit over bearing edges, in addition to a roll-over hoop design, allowing for thousands of pounds of pressure without failure. Evans says Level 360 provides increased resonance and a very wide tuning range (and ease of tuning). There\u2019s nothing like a newly installed set of heads. They feel great and offer plenty of sustain and a bright sound. Sadly, a few gigs quickly take their toll, and the combination of a fatigued head and stick marks/dents diminish the sustain and clarity of your tone. Drums tend to lose a bit of their tune and become more difficult to tension evenly, too, so for those of us who didn\u2019t win a lifetime supply of heads on The Price Is Right, we just live with the limitations until they become unbearable. It\u2019s just too costly to replace heads after every couple of gigs, not to mention time-consuming. You can probably tell where we\u2019re going with this\u2026 We installed a set of UV1s on a vintage mahogany kit with 12\u201d, 13\u201d and 16\u201d toms and a 14\u201d snare. These drums fare well with an \u201cAmbassador-weight\u201d head, which provides enough durability, a bright attack, and good sustain, while bringing out the superb low-end response of the African mahogany shells. We compared the UV1s with a known quantity on a kit that has seen its share of 10-mil heads over the years. Gigs ranged from light acoustic rock to funk and hard classic rock, with a bit of jazz in the mix for good measure. Unboxing the UV1 heads revealed a level of quality consistent with Evans\u2019 current offerings, with a few differences: 1. The new UV1 logo is clean and unfettered and seems to hint at something different. It\u2019s as if parent company, D\u2019Addario, wants us to know that they wiped the slate clean before sitting down to design the UV1. 2. The coating is... different. While it\u2019s white and textured, like traditional coated heads, the color is bright and inviting and there\u2019s a consistency to it that suggests an advanced manufacturing technique. In addition, there\u2019s a bit more texture to it. This led us to expect a more articulate brush sound. 3. There is a small ring (about 1/4\u201d thick) of uncoated area around the circumference of the head. Evans tells us that \u201c...many drummers who beta tested this product felt that the coating allowed for a much easier tuning experience. They felt that having an uncoated collar allowed for clearer pitches and a more lively sound from a coated head. The uncoated collar was also a way to differentiate this head visually from its competitors.\u201d Tuning the UV1 heads was a breeze. We attribute this to the Level 360 system, as other Level 360 heads we\u2019ve evaluated were highly consistent and very easy to seat and tune. The UV1s immediately exhibited an open, clear tone over a wide range of tuning. We chose to tune the vintage drum kit in the middle of its tuning range for the best combination of body, sustain, and clarity. Plus, we\u2019d recently been gigging with other 10-mil, single-ply heads using this tuning scheme. For reference, we used wood-tipped hickory sticks, in sizes 5A, 5B, and 2B. The Evans UV1 heads sounded and felt great, but here is where it gets interesting. At the end of the first gig, we found dark stick marks on the heads and thought, \u201cWell, so much for the super-durable UV-cured coating!\u201d But upon touching the \u201cmarks\u201d on the heads, we were shocked to find that this was just debris on the head surface that could be wiped away\u2014the coating on the UV1 heads was \u201csanding\u201d the tips of our sticks and removing the oxidation that they\u2019d picked up from our cymbals! Weird indeed. The UV1 heads feel great to play on. As anticipated, the surface was very well suited to brushwork, and the heads retained their texture even after they\u2019d received several nights worth of pounding. Ten shows later, the heads still pretty much looked like new and the sound quality hadn\u2019t diminished, either. They still sounded bright and articulate, with a warm tone and nice, round low end. We even received compliments from both bandmates and sound engineers regarding the sound of our beaded brass snare, which we\u2019d tuned for a full, open sound, with a nicely controlled ring. At this point, we turned in the review to our Editor, who said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait. Keep gigging,\u201d which we\u2019ve done pretty much weekly for a few additional\u2026 months. After months of use, these heads should be experiencing some real wear, but it\u2019s just so minimal! They still sound great, and they are still holding their tuning stability. And, the coating doesn\u2019t look badly worn at all. Truly, these heads are a remarkable achievement. Available in sizes from 10\u201d-18\u201d, they cost a bit more than the G1 series (about 25 percent, on average) but the increase in durability should provide a better return on investment. While we\u2019re sure that Evans UV1 heads will eventually wear out just like any other plastic head that you might choose to bang on, it really does appear that Evans has prolonged your trip to the drum store. We really don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to need to replace these heads, and we gig weekly on them. As Mr. Wonka said: \u201cWe are the music-makers and we are the dreamers of dreams.\u201d Well, that includes the engineers at Evans, who we hope are hard at work on a real-life, fizzy, lifting drink!"

      "value": "We are always on the lookout for cool sounding virtual instruments. UVI has a number of intriguing plug-ins, and one that definitely exceeded our expectations is the Urban Suite collection. Essentially five virtual instruments in one, Urban Suite provides an 8.1GB sample library professionally mastered by Chris Gehringer (Rihanna, JayZ, 50 Cent, Wu-Tang Clan, Snoop Dog, Nas, Naughty by Nature and Robin Thicke) at Sterling Sound in NYC. The bundle includes the following five virtual instruments: Of note, the Urban Suite plug-in runs within the UVI Workstation and Falcon hosts. These are the master control centers for most UVI products, and allow for control of layering sounds, effects, and mixing. In concept, it is similar to Native Instruments Kontakt (or Kontakt Player) which essentially is the master control for loaded sample collections. Just about every Mac and PC DAW format is represented, and we had no problems running Urban Suite AAX plug-ins within ProTools 10 and 11. Urban Suite requires an iLok account for authorization (with or without an iLok hardware dongle). Beat Shaper was one of our favorite parts of the Suite. Drum sounds were all high quality, and there was a good blend of classic and modern sounds. While there weren\u2019t as many presets as say, Arturia\u2019s Spark, we found it easy to edit the supplied sounds, substitute indivdual drums, and create new patterns. So while there may be less pre-made beats, there\u2019s no shortage of sounds to make your own killer beats. Some presets were certainly inspiring as a writing starting point. Prime 8 is essentially a Roland TR-808 emulation. Despite UVI referring to it as an \u201cX0X\u201d drum machine, the graphic UI is clearly an 808! While we didn\u2019t have an actual 808 to run side by side, we are quite familiar with the sound, and UVI did a great job here. Again, like BeatShaper, competitors products may have more presets out-of-the-box, but the sound quality here is excellent, and the software is easy to navigate. Urban X is a virtual analog synth that basically covers a little bit of everything. There are pads, basses, synths, leads, guitar, strings, and keyboard sounds. It\u2019s sort of like UVI\u2019s version of AIR\u2019s Xpand2 or Arturia\u2019s Analog Factory: a little bit of everything. Once again, it\u2019s somewhat light on presets, but the basics are covered, and what is included sounds good. There are few unique sounds in here, too, but as you can tweak everything to suite your taste, there\u2019s plenty of room to create unique sounds. Scratch Machine is a cool inclusion in the Suite, and let us unleash our inner DJ (much to our editor\u2019s dismay). We scratched things up using our controller keyboard, but a virtual scratch/DJ controller would likely make this even better. For those with the know-how, there are a lot of samples to use beyond the basics, allowing for a lot of creative ideas. Finally, Beat Controller was another one of our favorite parts of the Suite. Divided into two screens, it provides an easy way to loop different samples: bass drum, snare, hi-hat, phrases, etc. This really showed off some of the great sampled sounds in Urban Suite, and the presets were really inspirational, featuring some great grooves to start with. It was very easy to turn parts off and on, change their octave, or substitiute them altogether. The downloadable PDF manuals from UVI are well-written and provide nice step-by-step illustrations for utilizing various software features. The more we used Urban Suite, the more we saw its potential. While you could make the argument that, for example, the synth section isn\u2019t very deep, Urban Suite isn\u2019t trying to go deep. It\u2019s trying to be immediate and useful, which it is. Aimed at contemporary music producers and loaded with both classic and modern sounds, we think Urban Suite does a great job of being an all-in-one solution for writing hip-hop, R&B, or anything else you can think of. UVI\u2019s Urban Suite sells for $199, and considering you get five virtual instruments in one bundle (all of which we enjoyed), we think it\u2019s a good value. UVI www.uvi.net"

      "value": "If you\u2019re a serious musician, you don\u2019t need a lecture as to the importance of proper hearing protection. But if you\u2019ve only ever grabbed those squishy foam plugs, we can understand your disappointment in the experience. They feel fine and reduce volume, but they totally destroy the quality of the sound in the process. High end frequencies? What high end? Etymotic has been producing hearing protection for over three decades, and their latest high-fidelity products really fit the bill for serious musicians: reducing volume from dangerous listening levels to acceptable levels, while preserving audio quality. We have spent some time with both the ER\u202220XS High-Fidelity Earplugs as well as the Music\u2022PRO High-Fidelity Electronic Earplugs, and have to say\u2026 these work great! No matter what the scenario, we experienced lower volume levels with full audio quality. They were comfortable enough to forget about for hours on end, and musical instruments sounded as bright and clear as expected, only quieter. So, how do they differ? The ER\u202220XS earplugs are passive and come with a tiny, soft plastic, carrying case and three different tips: standard and large, 3-flange rubber tips, and a foam tip. They are designed to reduce sound levels 20dB at all frequencies, and a thin cable can be optionally installed that lets you hang the earplugs around your neck when they are removed from your ears. We used them in live rehearsals with our band, attending live music concert events, and\u2026 walking around the drum hall D at the Winter NAMM Show! We never enjoyed the drum hall as much as we did this year with the ER20s fitted to our heads. The active Music\u2022PRO earplugs are more involved. Shipping in a small hard case, they include a larger assortment of tips and a cable, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. They use hearing aid batteries and provide active monitoring of the ambient noise level. A recessed switch facilitates choosing between two different operating modes: Natural hearing occurs until a loud sound is experienced, at which point they deliver nearly instantaneous 15dB reduction. Or, the earplugs provide a 6dB boost for softer sounds, with automatic 9dB reduction was needed. Our primary issue is the reliance on hearing aid batteries. Though no fault of the earplugs, those batteries drain from the moment you remove their protective shipping sticker, whether installed or not. Opening the battery compartment when the earplugs are not in use may extend their life a little bit, but you should only expect 10-14 days of useful life at best before replacement. Etymotic supplies many batteries to start, and they are cheap enough to purchase at a pharmacy, but we found that managing batteries wasn\u2019t worth the effort, particularly since the ER20s sounded so fantastic with zero fuss. For someone used to living with hearing aids, or whose job requires working in a loud noise environment, making battery management part of your hearing protection routine isn\u2019t a big deal, and these earplugs do a great job reducing the loud stuff without compromising your ability to hold a conversation. But for the average serious musician, this is a hassle we\u2019d rather not bother with. At $300 for the pair, you really must commit yourself to the process. Fortunately, should your batteries die, have no fear. The Music\u2022PROs will still passively reduce sound levels. Costing only $20 for a pair of ER\u202220XS earplugs, unless you\u2019ve already purchased custom earplugs, it would be foolish not to check out these earplugs. We\u2019ll be packing ER20s with us whenever we find ourselves attending a concert event or without use of our custom, in-ear monitors. You\u2019ve got those, right? Confusing operation may not matter if your end game is sound design or use in the studio. In that regard, there\u2019s a reason many pros have snapped these synths up: the Accelerator is a highly authentic sounding, modeled-analog synth, and some of its sounds are downright fantastic. \u201cSolplex Etymotic Research www.etymotic.com"

      "value": "Hot on the heels of the fantastic Orion Studio ( ), Orion has introduced another new interface, the Orion32 HD. This 64-channel, premium audio interface, is based on the Orion32 but in addition to upgraded audio specs, ads HDX connectivity for direct connectivity to Pro Tools HD systems. It also features USB 3.0, MADI, ADAT, and S/PDIF, so odds are you\u2019ve got a way to incorporate this interface into your studio, with our without Pro Tools HD at the center of it. The Orion32 HD has 32-in/32-out analog via DB25, and features the same fantastic clocking, low latency operation, and hardware-based vintage effects as siblings in the product family. \u2014SK The Aston Halo Shadow provides another solution for reflection filtering in a portable vocal booth design. In a shape resembling a clam shell, it enables the vocalist to enjoy the surroundings of the room without interference from unwanted reflections due to the hemispherical filtering. With its proprietary easy-mount hardware, it attaches directly to a microphone stand. \u2014DD Thomas Barefoot has done it again with a new design to complement the already legendary Micro Main speakers. Only this time, Barefoot has targeted smaller studios and home recording enthusiasts with the Footprint01 three-way, nearfield monitor. Inspired by the Micro Main, this new speaker is priced at around $3,500 for the pair, but considering that the next step up is the Mini Main (which retails close to $6,000/pair), this set puts Barefoot monitor speakers within the realm of possibility for many project studios. The Footprint01 has most of the same features of its larger family members like Meme speaker voice emulation (so you can audition material on virtual NS 10s), a huge frequency response of 36Hz to 45Khz, two eight-inch, side woofers that utilize Barefoot\u2019s Dual Force opposing sub technology, a \u00a0four-inch aluminum cone midrange driver, and a one-inch, dual ring, radiating tweeter. Most of the differences have to do with aesthetics and more cost effective tool and clamp designs. Don\u2019t get us wrong, the Footprint isn\u2019t in the same league as the Micro Main in terms of components and image detail, but for the price, is gets \u201cclose enough\u201d for many people, and worth serious consideration for midrange speakers in this price range. \u2014JL Blue Microphones introduced the new Essentials Series, comprised of three of their popular entry-level microphones, with updated features and specs. The three mics are: Baby Bottle SL (MSRP $399.99), which (according to Blue) delivers classic warmth and presence; Bluebird SL (MSRP $299.99), which offers modern, crystal-clear performance; and Spark (MSRP $199.99), which delivers detailed, transparent sound. Blue has refined the sonics, and all three mics now feature a 100Hz high-pass filter and -20dB pad. Each microphone in the Essentials Series comes in a wooden storage box and includes a custom pop filter. Blue was also showing the latest generation of its headphones. The Sadie ($399), replacing the outgoing Mo-Fi, features a multi-jointed headband, a built-in 250mW audiophile amp that delivers twelve hours of use from a three-hour charge, and a closed-back design. Frequency response is an impressive 20Hz-to-20kHz. Three modes include amp on, bass boost, and amp on (passive). The Ella ($699) is a closed back, planar magnetic headphone, also featuring the same amp as the Sadie. They should be available in February. \u2014JB ISOVOX The ISOVOX provides an interesting alternative to those large, space consuming vocal booths. Not only is it small, compact, and attaches to a microphone stand, but it's fully collapsible for easy storage and transport. It may not be a good idea for a person with claustrophobia, but serves a great purpose for vocal practice (or late night recording) without interrupting your neighbors. On the loud NAMM Show floor, it provided a welcome relief from the noise. \u2014DD We always thought those computer keyboards with shortcut keys printed on them looked useful, but they were pricey, and also a bit cluttered looking for times when you weren\u2019t working in your favorite DAW. Enter KB Covers, who make rubber keyboard shortcut covers that simply lay over your existing keyboard just like the funky colored skins that people love to stick on their laptop keyboards. We already put one of their Pro Tools keyboard covers to use on our Apple Pro Keyboard, and now we know a few things we didn\u2019t even realize had keyboard equivalents! And, because these aren\u2019t keyboard replacements, you can pick up multiple shortcut skins for each of your favorite apps. There are shortcut keyboard covers for most popular audio and video related applications, in sizes for a variety of keyboards ranging from the Apple Wireless to the Pro keyboard with numeric keypad, plus various Macbook laptops. \u2014SK The Lewitt LCT 640 TS microphone is interesting and innovative: it has two diaphragms (and two XLR outputs) that enable the user to change polar patterns even after recording is completed. After recording to two tracks, the accompanying Polarizer plug-in for your DAW enables you to adjust the polar pattern and balance between the diaphragms after-the-fact. Awesome! This innovative solution enables stereo recording with one mic, which is a great time saver and solves a lot of phase issues out of the box (think of just one mic positioned above a drum kit, for example). Much time and effort can be avoided by not having to measure mic distances for phase issues. Additionally, the software enables the engineer to make in phase doubles of vocals and just about anything else from one take. We can\u2019t wait to play with this mic in the studio, as it\u2019s truly an exciting and intriguing audio product. \u2014JL Not to be outdone by Lewitt, MXL introduced another innovative microphone, the dual capsule DX-2, designed for use with amplified instruments. One side of the mic is flat, designed so that you can simply drape the microphone over the top of a guitar speaker cabinet. The speaker-facing capsule is a super cardioid, large capsule design, optimized for full-range sonic capture, while the capsule facing away from the cabinet is a small cardioid design focused on mid-range and high-end detail. A blend control on the face of the mic lets you dial in the captured tone to taste, with a single XLR output that records the blend of your choice. We\u2019ve already got it in the studio for testing and can\u2019t wait to explore this microphone innovation. \u2014SK Just when you thought the StudioLive series couldn\u2019t get any better, PreSonus threw away the old book and wrote a new one. The third generation of the StudioLive series is presently shipping only in the 32-channel format, with the StudioLive 16 following shortly. Besides completely redesigned Fat Channel capabilities that now offer vintage-style EQ and compression options on each channel, the mixers have integrated multi-channel recording, straight to SD card! They now feature built-in AVB networking and digital scribble strips on every channel, and\u2026 motorized faders! We\u2019re sad to see that Firewire connectivity gone, but the newly added USB 2.0 connectivity is more than up to the task for multi-track recording in a host DAW. We also got to put our hands on the new FaderPort 8 studio control surface, which looks pretty sharp. It just arrived in our studio for review, so stay tuned for all the details. \u2014SK Slate Digital released the Virtual Recording Studio (VRS), the culmination of the Slate vision to model vintage gear never before affordable for most audio engineers and recording musicians. It includes the VRS-8 eight-channel preamp and A/D converter that enables users of Slate Virtual Microphone System (VMS) and the Slate Virtual Mix Rack (VMR) to have access to the greatest microphones, preamps, and effects ever created (virtually speaking, of course). When the \u00a0interface is paired with the mix rack plug-ins, ML-1 LDC microphone, and the (also newly announced) ML-2 small diaphragm mic, this system packs one hell of wallop in terms of specs and versatility (the VRS-8 has 124 db of dynamic range and low latency of just 0.7ms). If you aren\u2019t sticker shocked easily, the VRS-8, one ML-1, and five ML-2\u2019s will retail for $3,000, which includes a one-year subscription to every plug in Slate has. In case it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, that means you could have access to most of the greatest microphone /preamp signal chains in history. If you already have Slate gear, the VMS and VRS-8 retail together for $2,000. In the middle of the pack (price-wise) is a five pack of ML-2s and the VRS-8 for $2,499. If this system delivers what it is supposed to, we expect that it will become a staple of project studios everywhere. \u2014JL Who doesn\u2019t want a more powerful version of the Apollo Twin desktop interface for mixing on the go from your laptop? The new Apollo Twin MkII has improved A/D/A converters that provide increased dynamic range, and it now offers quad-core processing for all of those fantastic, hardware-accelerated, UA plug-ins. It also features improved monitoring options and a built-in talkback mic. \u2014SK Our studios have at least a few pair of Yamaha headphones, and it\u2019s nice to see (and hear) that Yamaha didn\u2019t leave well-enough alone in their latest revisions. Yamaha introduced the HPH-MT5 ($169) and HPH-MT8 ($329) studio headphones. The closed-back design features synthetic leather and low-resistance cushions to absorb excess vibrations and reduce sound leakage. Both include a detachable, straight, 3-meter cord and coiled 1.5-meter cable. The cables feature a corrosion-resistant, gold-plated, stereo mini plug and quarter-inch stereo adapter. \u2014JB"

      "value": "We saw a preview of the new Strike Pro kits with mesh heads and wooden shells last year, and they should finally be shipping. The finished product looks better than the early sample, and the new Strike module has over 1,700 multi-sampled instruments, a 4.3\u201d color, backlit LCD screen, and an onboard sampler! These are among the best feeling electronic drum kits thanks to the mesh heads and cymbals that feature a softer feel than typical plastic triggers. The fully loaded, six-piece kit with hi-hats and four cymbals, includes a chrome rack, snare stand, and hi-hat stand, all for under $2,400, making it a pretty significant alternative to Roland\u2019s vDrums in a similar configuration\u2026 for thousands more. \u2014SK Dialtune offers an innovative solution that enables completely uniform tuning of a drum head with one simple turn of a drum key. Unlike the standard method of adjusting each lug nut around the rim of the drum head, this new mechanism uses a high-tension wire snaked around the drum to each lug, tightened uniformly from a single drum key, and providing equal tension across the entire drum head. The end result is a quick, one-step tuning process, and it also speeds up replacement of a damaged head. Installation simply requires a screwdriver to replace your existing lugs with the new system. \u2014DD The DW Purpleheart snare was a thing of beauty, and this year, DW\u2019s Custom Shop showed off a spectacular kit made from this unique hardwood. Sure, you can get a great sounding DW kit in the familiar maple, oak, walnut, SSC configuration, etc., but we like that this kit has a particularly distinct (unique) sound. According to DW, this wood, which has a naturally purple hue, is more dense than oak. Another clever introduction was the Lowboy Hi-Hat, a 5000-series piece of hardware that enables you to place an hi-hat, tambourine, or other rhythmic accessory in your kit without taking up much prime real estate. We\u2019re sure many players will find creative uses for this mini-hat. \u2014SK Italy\u2019s Techra has created some really nice drumsticks in the CarbonPRO line (and other series). As the name suggests, they are made from carbon fiber, which offers perfect weight balance and 2-3x more durability than wooden equivalents. They feel great, and we\u2019re looking forward to testing them in the studio to see how they hold up compared with our favorite wood. \u2014SK The new, fifth-generation Mapex Saturn kit features a number of updates, most importantly: SONIClear bearing edges, designed to provide an expanded tuning range thanks to more precise mating to your drum heads, and SONIClear suspension mounts. The drums have beautiful figured tops, and we were happy to see that they ship with two-ply Remo Emperor Clear batter heads and a Powerstroke P3 batter head on the kick, so you may not need to factor a whole new set of heads into your initial purchase. \u2014SK They\u2019re back! We almost tripped over ourselves when we rounded the corner and saw an entire wall full of colorful cymbals. Welcome back, Color Sound! If you\u2019re looking for a little splash with your splash (or crash, hi-hat, ride\u2026), check out the new Color Sound 900 series, which are based on the traditional-finish 900 Series. Supposedly the colorization results in a slightly drier sound with slightly less sustain and a more focused attack, which could be desireable for some players. Guaranteed to be a big hit at your next \u201880s gig, or when you go on tour supporting Katy Perry. \u2014SK The best just keep on getting better. And while $7,000 is still your ballpark price for enjoying the best that electronic percussion has to offer, Roland\u2019s latest evolution of their full mesh vDrums kits, the TD-50KV and TD-50K, are fantastic. The biggest change is the updated TD-50 sound module (available separately for $2,400), which adds some great features in addition to upgrading the overall sound quality, depth of editing, and detailed performance nuances. Users can now load their own drum samples onto an SD card and trigger them from any of the pads. The brain can connect to your computer via USB and transmit up to ten channels of audio, and there are eight individual outputs and a pair of XLR outputs for live use and analog recording. The fourteen-inch PD-140DS Digital Snare has a new multi-element sensor and three-layer mesh head that connects via a digital link to the brain, and delivers more detailed response than the previous generation. A new ride cymbal also provides more playing dynamics, and you can purchase an optional acoustic kick drum with built-in trigger if you\u2019d like your vDrums kit to look more acoustic. We last reviewed the then-flagship and look forward to a fully in-depth review of Roland\u2019s latest vDrums evolution. \u2014SK Need something special in your kit? Special effect cymbals were all the rage with Sabian this year. Some of the unique cymbals introduced included the AAX Aero Splash, AA Mini Holy China, XSR Fast Stax, and the B8X Ballistic Crash, the last of which looks precisely like what might happen if your drum cymbals could catch a bad case of the mumps. The holy patterns are sure to make for interesting visuals on stage, but the sound is definitely going to be a matter of personal taste. There are nine new designs to check out, and we love that companies are now purposely matching cymbals in stacked cymbal sets. \u2014SK The stars in their lineup this year were the Star Series: Star Bubinga, Star Maple, and Star Walnut, each featuring the latest Tama hardware and spectacular finishes. These flagship drums have thinner shells than the Starclassic line and a refined bearing edge that has a rounder peak than Tama\u2019s traditional bearing edge. Another beautiful detail: the inside of the drum shells are hand finished with oil for a beautiful look. \u2014SK Happy 50th Birthday to Yamaha Drums! Hot on the heels of our review of the introduced-last-year Recording Custom kit ( ), we were treated to the limited edition, 50th Anniversary, drum set. It\u2019s based on the Absolute Hybrid Maple series and comes either featuring birdseye maple or curly maple. The comemorative kits have gold lugs and a cool 50th Anniversary badge (and custom artwork on the bass drum head). Priced with an MSRP of $12,000, we don\u2019t expect everyone to race out and purchase one, but\u2026 don\u2019t you just want to? \u2014SK Zildjian didn\u2019t have many new cymbals, but did offer some useful genre-based boxed sets containing a set of hi-hats, two crashes, and a ride: Rock, featuring A Zildjian cymbals; Country, featuring K Zildjian cymbals; Worship, featuring K Customs; and Gospel, featuring A Custom cymbals. The other product line of interest was the L80 Low Volume cymbal line. What started as the Gen X cymbals has evolved into a line of cymbals specifically designed for extremely low volume output. As their name implies, the L80 cymbals are 80% quieter than equivalent traditional cymbals, and totally useful if you want to practice in an apartment, condo, or other space where volume can\u2019t be tolerated. As with the Gen 16, the cymbals are as beautiful as they are functional. \u2014SK"

      "value": "The classic MPCs were standalone music production units, but more recent models have been hardware/software hybrids, meaning they required computer connectivity for operation. That is not the case with these two models, which combine modern features with standalone operation. The flagship MPC X has a multi-core processor and runs MPC Software 2.0 (this can also operate as a plug-in or standalone application on your PC/Mac. The MPCX has a 10.1-inch multi-touch screen and sixteen velocity- and pressure-sensitive RGB pads. There are also dedicated menu buttons, a large master encoder knob, and sixteen touch-sensitive, 360-degree, assignable pots (Q-Links) with adaptive OLED displays. There are multiple connectivity options as well: a 2-in/4-out MIDI interface, comprehensive audio I/O, and eight CV/Gate outputs! If your needs are more modest, Akai also released the battery-powerable MPC Live. It includes a 7-inch multi-touch screen, sixteen velocity- and pressure-sensitive pads, four touch-capacitive Q-Link controls, and a large, clickable, master encoder knob. It starts with an exapandable 2GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage. You get a 2-in/2-out MIDI interface, two selectable audio inputs (RCA and balanced 1\u20444-inch jack), and six configurable 1\u20444-inch jack outputs. Both are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2017. \u2014JB No, that\u2019s not a typo. Behringer is really making synths, and they are off to one heck of a great start! Although we had been following the hype and read the early SOS review, we still didn\u2019t know what to expect when it came time to actually put our hands on the DeepMind 12, and we came away with a favorable first imression. Here\u2019s a rundown for you: 12-voice analog synth with 49 keys. While it proudly displays the Roland Juno-106 inspiration it was purported to have stemmed from (check out the sliders), that core was just the starting point, as it\u2019s more powerful: two DCOs and two LFOs per voice, noise generator, unison detune, VCF, HPF, three ADSR Envelopes, eight-bus modulation matrix, 32-step sequencer, four digital effects engines, USB, MIDI In/Out/Thru, built-in Wi-Fi and remote control via an iPad running an editor app. One unique and groundbreaking feature is that the synth utilizes Microsoft\u2019s Hololens technology, allowing you to use Augmented Reality as an interface! Basically, you wear a visor which projects holographic images onto the surrounding environment (unlike virtual reality which puts you into a completely new environment). We saw a demo of this at NAMM, and it was interesting seeing projected lines and polygons in the air changing parameters in real time when they were \u201ctouched.\u201d Interestingly, now that the Musik brand owns so many partner companies, the DeepMind effects are curated from TC Electronic, Midas, and Klark Teknik Technolgies, plus reverbs from the Lexicon 480L. If all of this tech came with a $2,500 price tag, we would have found it interesting at the very least. But debuting for only $999, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find as much bang for the buck in a synthesizer, analog or otherwise. We look forward to reviewing one of these soon. \u2014JB Every year we show up at Winter NAMM and ask ourselves, \u201cWhat will Dave introduce that separates the cash from our wallets?\u201d This year, the REV2 keyboard handily won us over. It\u2019s an update of the Prophet \u201808 ( ), and Dave took that awesome keyboard over the top with his updates. At its core, you\u2019ll find the same sound engine as the classic \u201808 (you can even load your existing \u201808 sounds right into it), but now\u2026 polyphonic doubled to sixteen voices, a more complex modulation matrix, waveshape modulation for all of the waveforms, digital effects that can be applied to each of two sound layers (either split or stacked), a polyphonic step sequencer, and an internal PSU (the original keyboard used an external wall wart). Priced at only $2,000 (don\u2019t bother with the eight-voice version for $1,500, because hey, this is sixteen analog voices), this provides a great sonic alternative to other synths in the family, but with all of the modern updates that those synths have benefited from over the past decade. Oh\u2026 and did we mention that it has a full, 61-key keyboard? \u2014SK Digitakt is a new digital compact drum machine from Elektron. Available April 2017, there was only a prototype at NAMM, but it appears to be an interesting machine. Digitakt feaures include eight internal audio tracks, eight dedicated MIDI tracks, one multi-mode filter per audio track, one assignable LFO per track, delay and reverb send effects, sampling capability, 64MB sample memory, 1GB+ drive storage, two \u00bc\u201d inputs and two \u00bc\u201d balanced outputs, one USB 2.0 port, MIDI In/Out/Thru ports, and Overbridge support. Overbridge is an interesting technology that enables Elektron instruments to operate as DAW plugins, and even allows DAW tracks to be processed through the Elektron hardware. This technology also allows multiple Elektron devices to be interconnected directly to process each others\u2019 output. \u2014JB There was plenty to be excited about at the KORG booth, starting with ARP Odyssey synths that now include full-sized keys, while the multi-colored Monologue delivers true analog, mono-synth capabilities in a compact package that also featured full-sized keys. Korg also hinted at a fabulous new stage piano, the Grandstage, which incorporates some Kronos-caliber sounds (and seven sound engines) in a typical stage-ready format, with a fully weighted keyboard. It was just a prototype, though, so don\u2019t expect to see it hitting the streets just yet. But even more exciting perhaps (for some of us) was news from the Kronos camp. Last year saw a limited Platinum colored keyboard, while this year saw a limited Gold edition. But we were most thrilled by the almost-missed-it Kronos LS, a version of the 88-key Kronos 2 now sporting a synth-action keyboard and weighing fifteen pounds less that almost wasn\u2019t going to be released in the USA at all. \u2014SK The Toraiz AS-1 analog monosynth is an interesting collaboration between Pioneer and Dave Smith Instruments. You are getting essentially a single voice of the analog Prophet-6 synthesizer, with 495 presets (and an additional 495 user sounds), dual effects, 64-step sequencer, a touchpad-style keyboard, arpeggiator, slider, and an OLED screen. You can connect the Toraiz AS-1 to the Toraiz SP-16 sampler via MIDI and use the sampler\u2019s sequencer for interesting rhythms. Together, the two TORAIZ instruments can be connected to a DJM mixer via Pro DJ Link and MIDI. It will be available in March of 2017 with a US MAP of $499. Not into the whole DJ thing? Nobody\u2019s stopping you from using this as a cool, lower-priced, Dave Smith monosynth! \u2014JB Radial\u2019s new Key-Largo is an awesome keyboard mixer and computer digital audio interface built into a rugged metal footswitch enclosure. There are three stereo input channels plus a fourth USB audio input channel for your computer, and all four channels can make use of an effects loop, useful if you have a few vintage keyboards and want them to all share your classic BOSS CE-1 chorus pedal or wah pedal, for example. There are two sets of outputs (front-of-house and monitor send), and MIDI In/Out jacks that can be used with your computer via the USB interface, which provides MIDI in addition to audio. One footswitch provides sustain pedal capabilities (you plug it into any of your keyboard\u2019s sustain pedal input jacks), and the other bypasses the effects loop. \u2014SK"

      "value": "Take our money! Besides being an amazing producer, composer, and bassist, Jon Stockman worked closely with Darkglass Electronics to design the Alpha\u2022Omega Dual Bass Overdrive/Preamp pedal. It\u2019s everything you would expect from Darkglass, and this pedal will allow you to create some massive bass tones. We played it extensively and thought it sounded fantastic. \u2014KP Each year at NAMM we notice more bass manufacturers introducing multi-scale basses with fanned frets. We played so many different fanned fretted basses at NAMM this year that by the end, they started to feel quite natural and easy to play. We\u2019re just about ready to dive in for ourselves and purchase one. One company building these guitars longer than most, and only making multi-scale basses, is Canada\u2019s Dingwall Guitars. We were excited to put our hands on the Dingwall NG2, a totally hot, modern looking (and sounding) bass that plays effortlessly (though you do have to reach a bit for that first fret). It\u2019s based on Dingwall\u2019s Combustion model, and we loved how balanced the bass sounded. The string tension was perfect for us, as fanned-fretted basses fix the loose, low B string problem that many traditional five-strings suffer from. Multi-scale basses feature a tighter string tension on the low string thanks to the longer scale on that string, and you can really dig in with this thing. Also new this year was the D-Bird, sporting a familiar, vintage Thunderbird shape, married to the modern aesthetics of a multi-scale neck. \u2014KP The Reidmar line of compact bass amps has been a huge success for the premium Swedish bass amp and bass effects pedal builders, and this year saw the introduction of another model in the lineup: the Reidmar 500, which offers a familiar feature set, but with improvements in the areas of both size and weight reduction. They are available as a compact head as well as part of the new Session Combo amp. EBS also introduced their new Blue Label Pedals, a trio of analog overdrive pedals developed for use by both guitar players and bassists (optimized to retain clarity in the bass\u2019 low frequencies). Black Haze, Drive Me Crazy, and The Drive offer various differences when it comes to providing just the right overdrive, and we just received them for a full, in-depth, comparative review. Also cool were a series of flat jumper cables for your pedalboard. Available in various lengths, these premium cables for interconnecting your pedals are right angled, with very flat ends and flat cable. Even better, the Blue Label Pedals each include one of these, so you can see how cool they are right away. \u2014SK The Fender Booth at NAMM revealed hundreds of new guitars and basses, but of most concern to most players would be the new American Professional bass line. The Fender American Standard line has been replaced with the \u201cnew and improved\u201d \u00a0American Professional Series, which aims to make a number of Fender\u2019s formerly premium instrument options standard on their most popular line of American-made instruments. The Jazz Bass and Precision Bass will come in four- and five-string versions, with a leftie option for the four-string versions, as well as a fretless Jazz four-string. The most obvious differences you\u2019ll find are new HiMass bridges and tall-narrow frets, which have replaced the familiar medium-jumbo frets of the past. We already have the American Professional Jazz 5 and Precision 4 in the studio for review, and you\u2019ll be in for a treat with either instrument. We\u2019ll cover all the other little design upgrades at that time, too. \u2014KP It\u2019s great that all of the bass companies are now building pedal-based preamps. Bassists can finally have a stunning array of tones at their feet, and the Hartke Bass Attack 2 is the latest pedal to join the fray. In this case, the pedal includes Hartke\u2019s special Shape EQ circuit, which provides a custom EQ curve, along with a generous collection of tone shaping and distorting options, plus the obligatory, XLR direct output for use straight into a console. \u2014SK We were in the Ibanez booth for hours playing their latest basses\u2014there were so many to try out! The most interesting was certainly the SRAS7 Ashula, a seven-string hybrid fretless and fretted bass. A pit band player or session player would probably appreciate only having to bring one bass to the gig, assuming you\u2019ve got the chops to handle a bass with more strings and a larger neck. This was the most talked about bass in the Ibanez booth to be sure, and definitely an overall buzz-worthy instrument throughout the show. \u2014KP If you\u2019re looking for a cool combo amp that packs big sound in a lightweight package, check out the new Markbass Ninja 102-250 Richard Bona signature amp! This 2x10 combo (plus Pizeo tweeter) puts out 250W RMS into 4ohms, has an effects loop, direct out, and weighs only 36lbs. It sounded as good as it looks. \u2014SK The new SimS Custom \u201cSuper Quad\u201d pickups caught our eyes with the colored LEDs attached to a pair of humbuckers installed in an Enfield Fusion, a nice, boutique, J-bass-style instrument\u2026 except that these weren\u2019t humbuckers, per se. They were also single coil pickups, and split coil pickups, too, depending on the toggle switch settings. If you love tonal variety but worry in the live context as to which pickup sound you\u2019re playing, seeing color-coded LEDs on the individual pickups indicating what kind of pickup you\u2019re hearing is extremely practical. And, these are custom-shop pickups, so chalk this one up to being more than just another pretty face. \u2014SK Mayones Instruments has been making handcrafted basses and guitars since 1982 and is still a family-owned company based in Poland. The Jabba Mala 5 is the name of the signature bass belonging to phenomenal bassist and YouTube sensation, Federico Malaman. It\u2019s a great J-style bass that plays beautifully, and we can\u2019t wait to get our hands on one for review. \u2014KP Phil Jones Bass showed off the new D-1000, a compact bass head/amp that has a five band EQ, limiter, effects loop, direct out, and weighs only 5.3 pounds. Pair it with the new Cab 47, which houses 4x7\u201d woofers and a 2\u201d tweeter. Your compact rig never looked so cool, and then of course there is that classic, hi-fi, clean PJB tone\u2026 \u2014SK Bassist Mike Watt of the Minutemen and the Stooges introduced his Mike Watt signature bass, dubbed the Wattplower. This short scale, 30\u201dbass looks like it\u2019s something from the past, but the sound is timeless. The bass played and sounded great. Mike Watt\u2019s collaboration with Reverend has resulted in a killer vintage vibe instrument. \u2014KP If you were in too much of a rush, you might have run right past the Tech 21 booth and missed the awesome new, SansAmp GED-2112 Geddy Lee signature bass preamp. This awesome looking, single-rack space, vintage green colored, SansAmp is unique in that it provides two preamp circuits that run in parallel with each other. The Drive and Deep preamps have unique and complementary voices, and they can be blended together or run separately to individual power amps. The EQ section was customized to Geddy Lee\u2019s personal taste, and paired with a Fender Jazz Bass in the Tech 21 booth, it was almost as if the man himself was standing there playing with us. Expect a full review soon. \u2014SK and KP It\u2019s beginning to look like every amp manufacturer has now entered the pedal market. Do you think the pedal makers are going to get into the amp business, too? We were impressed by two new effects bass pedals from Trace Elliot, the Transit A for acoustic players, and Transit B for electric bass players. They look great on stage with their color-coordinated, backlit footswitch controls, but the real reason you\u2019ll want them is that Transit A features a chorus and reverb, tap-tempo delay, and boost, while Transit B features overdrive, compression and EQ. Or heck, maybe you just dig the cool colors. \u2014KP"

      "value": "Accel\u2019s FX Series Command Center is a great all-in-one pedalboard solution for players assembling pro-class rigs. And audio looper/function switcher with eight loops is integrated into the front of the aluminum pedalboard, with all connections running underneath the board instead of wasting space on deck. Use an Accel Audio power supply or install your favorite underneath, and enjoy the premium, bundled, patch cables in assorted sizes to get you up and running fast. \u2014SK The new BOSS Acoustic Singer Pro was one of those \u201cgame changing\u201d amps that impressed even the boutique tube amp snobs among us. As its name implies, the amp features two independent channels, enabling an acoustic guitar-playing singer to plug both a guitar and vocal source. What\u2019s special in this case, however, is that the amp analyzes the player\u2019s guitar chords and can provide instant harmonization to the vocal performance! \u00a0Add in a looper and a healthy complement of effects, and you\u2019ll be a one-man band in no time. The BOSS CP-1X Compressor pedal will be a welcome addition to many players\u2019 pedalboards. It\u2019s a digital, multiband compressor, providing more nuanced compression without muddying up tone like a classic, single-band, analog compressor, but it retains a familiar, easy-to-use interface. And for those of you who can\u2019t get enough Jazz Chorus in your lives, the new JC-22 is a compact, 30-watt version of the year-old JC-40 amp with a pair of diminutive 6.5\u201d speakers in a smaller, but similarly functional, package. \u2014BS & SK Breedlove introduced their new Concerto body shape, and on display were the Exotic Amazon and Masterclass Brazilian models, which really caught our eyes and ears. The company builds guitars with what they call sound profiling, meaning each instrument\u2019s wood is analyzed for its resonant properties and then is hand sanded and fine tuned to precise top thickness until target resonant frequencies are achieved in order to achieve consistency from one build to the next. The use of Brazilian rosewood, Cocobola, and other gorgeous tonewoods helped achieve a bell like sparkle when we played them\u2026 and we could hear this without taking an instrument into an enclosed sound booth. We were definitely surprised by the Purist Parlor Mahogany. With a paltry $665 MSRP, we played a surprisingly professional-grade acoustic! Indian rosewood fingerboard, mahogany neck, back, and sides all yielded a pleasurably brighter and louder guitar than we anticipated. This is one acoustic guitar builder who seems to keep getting better every time we see them. Look for a review of something spicy from these old hippies very soon. \u2014BS Calling all shredding southpaws! It was exciting to see the latest Charvel Pro-Mod San Dimas Style 1 and So-Cal Style 1 guitars available in left-handed models. Taking a page from the EVH guitars, these offer graphite-reinforced, compound radius necks (12-16\u201d), Floyd Rose trems, and a few of their own treatments such as the Seymour Duncan JB/\u201959 humbucker set in the San Dimas and Seymour Duncan TB-6/SH-6N in the So-Cal. \u2014SK D\u2019Angelico Guitars, New York City\u2019s flagship archtop brand, showed off their new Bob Weir SS guitar. With a vintage-style Bigsby trem, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant addition to the SS line. The guitar features dual humbucking pickups, push/pull knobs for coil tapping, a bound fretboard, and a rosewood neck. We also saw a pair of custom painted guitars with iconic pics of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis. Using american \u201850s icons was a nice nod to the D\u2019Angelico art deco design. We are not typically sceptics, but we eye-witnessed an Elvis guitar fall off a stand all by itself, where the guitar was well out of reach from attendees. Elvis has left the building. \u2014BS Keeping the DOD name more alive and well than it\u2019s ever been, Digitech released a fantastic, new, twin-button delay pedal called Rubberneck. It features over one full second of pure analog delay, which by itself is not anything new, but it can also pitch shift up to an octave from one time setting to the next in real time! Also featuring its own effects send and return, as well as a footswitch jack, allows for this unique delay pedal to be incorporated into complex rigs. Another extremely useful and cool pedal Digitech released was the FreqOut: a feedback pedal that works! We saw and heard right before our eyes and ears, very natural sounding feedback, even when playing single notes on an amp\u2019s clean setting. We nearly freaked out over this. \u2014BS What\u2019s a premium Swedish bass amp and bass effects pedal builder doing in our guitar report? Introducing their Blue Label Pedals, a trio of analog overdrive pedals developed for use by guitar players (and bassists, too). Black Haze, Drive Me Crazy, and The Drive offer various differences when it comes to providing just the right overdrive, and we just received them for a full, in-depth, comparative review. Also cool were a series of flat jumper cables for your pedalboard. Available in various lengths, these premium cables for interconnecting your pedals are right angled, with very flat ends and flat cable. Even better, the Blue Label Pedals each include one of these, so you can see how cool they are right away. \u2014SK We were very excited to check out the hot, new Inferno E766, otherwise known as ENGL\u2019s new Marty Friedman signature amp. This two-channel, fire-breathing, 100W, metal machine is built around four EL-34 tubes and features two channels with independent EQ, a gain boost on each, noise gate, series/parallel effects loop, and a second master volume switchable from a footswitch. \u2014SK Building on the wildly popular and fantastic sounding H9 ( ), Eventide unveiled a new algorithm; Pitchfuzz. Combining pitch, delay and fuzz-type distortion, we were able to hear some pretty interesting combinations further expanding the H9\u2019s already vast sonic palette. Pitchfuzz delivers three voices (non intelligent) which can be routed before or after the fuzz and delay. \u2014BS The EVH Wolfgang USA signature guitar was released in an array of finishes, and follows with a feature set we\u2019ve come to expect from the line. We are particularly fond of the EVH-branded Floyd Rose bridge (equipped with a D-Tuna) and the compound radius (12-16\u201d), graphite-reinforced, neck with its hand-rubbed finish. The feel of this one is slick and fast! Other features include a red kill switch (allowing for Eddie\u2019s typical stutter effect) and custom-wound EVH alnico pickups (the neck pickup is new for 2017). Ok EVH. Ya\u2019 really got us now. Continuing on with the lunchbox amp craze, EVH showed off its 5150III LBXII. The amp is a 2xEL84 and and 4x12AX7 package. In this second version of the 15 Watt, two-channel amp, we love how it can be dialed down all the way to 3.5 watts. Supplied with a single-button footswitch, the amp can jump from pristine clean to rich overdrive that sustains wonderfully. \u2014BS American Professional. The familiar American Standard line has been retired (somewhat) in favor of this new line, and we think it\u2019s about time as well. Borrowing some bits here and there from the fantastic Fender Elite series instruments (see our ), the new American Professional line guitars have improvements all over: upgraded bridges (the Tele has a redesigned bridge with three compensated, brass barrel saddles), new V-Mod single coil pickups designed by pickup guru, Tim Shaw, a new modern \u201cDeep C\u201d neck profile, narrow-tall frets, treble-bleed circuit (to preserve high-end frequencies when rolling off the volume), and more. There were plenty of new amps, too. After drooling over the custom shop\u2019s latest reproduction of the legendary \u2018 57 series of amps, we finally have one of these beauties in the studio for review. All of the nuances have been faithfully recreated right down to the vintage yellow capacitors and Schumacher transformers as featured in the original 5E5A circuit. We were also impressed by Fender\u2019s latest acoustic amp line. The Acoustic 100 and Acoustic 200 amps are housed in gorgeous wood cabinets and feature modern amplifier and small speaker array designs. Expect a full review soon. \u2014SK Building on Friedman\u2019s successful line of stomp boxes, Friedman released two more pedals aptly named after their amps. The Buxom Boost and the Dirty Shirley Drive were featured and upon listening, they got us scary close to their inspirational amps\u2019 sounds. Also new for Friedman was the introduction of a new, high end, single-cut electric guitar: the Metro D. Surprisingly light for a maple-on-mahogany, non-chambered instrument, it played wonderfully. Hmmm\u2026 making amps, pedals, and now, instruments? Could this be the start of the next Fender? \u2014BS Fryette introduced the Valvulator GP/Di Direct Recording Amplifier, a tabletop, 1 Watt, tube amp with integrated load. It has dual cascading gain stages, Sag control, cabinet and mike simulation, and a speaker output that can drive a 1x12\u201d cabinet. Fryette mentions four dual triode tubes, though we\u2019re not exactly sure what type of tubes they are. \u2014SK When we reviewed the Grandmeister 36 ( ), we were impressed with the stunning array of features packed into a compact, low-wattage guitar amp, and the sound was good, though nothing to specifically rave about to our discerning guitar audience. Then, along came the Hughes & Kettner flagship amp, the TriAmp Mark 3, which has spectacular tone, and a killer feature set ( ). Thus, we were excited to learn all about the new Grandmeister 40, because something good has been made better. We spoke with one of the product managers, who explained that after the design of the TriAmp Mark 3, the engineers were so in love with the new preamp designs that they decided to revisit the Grandmeister and completely replace the preamp circuits with new ones based on the TriAmp. We\u2019ll be getting one in the studio for review soon, and can\u2019t wait to hear (away from the NAMM convention noise) just how much this capable little amp has been improved. \u2014SK Ibanez has long featured guitar virtuoso, Steve Vai, as its ambassador, and his signature guitar, the Jem, is enjoying its 25th anniversary this year. Reissued in three original colors (Lochness Green, Desert Yellow and Shocking pink), these guitars are guaranteed to make players and fans reminisce about the times when fast guitars and big hair ruled the guitar landscape (and the airwaves). These aren\u2019t exact reproductions, but the subtle differences such as the five-piece neck (originals were just one-piece) are sure to add value to this line. Also worth noting in the signature guitar lineup were two new Paul Stanley guitars, the PS120L and the PSM10. The PS120L is loaded with Seymour Duncan pickups and a fixed Fulltone III bridge, and is sure to be an excellent hard rock guitar with or without face paint. Expanding on the premium line, we loved the RG1070 is now available in a striking charcoal black burst and cerulean blue burst finishes. These guitars come loaded with three DiMarzio pickups and the tried and true Edge Zero II trem. Across numerous hot looking, new RG- and S-series guitars from the Prestige and Premium lines, we noticed that the popular pickup choices are classic favorites of ours: DiMarzio Tone Zone in the bridge, and Air Norton in the neck position, with a variety of options on middle-pickup equipped instruments. Shred!!! \u2014BS Jackson released a number of new models in the Soloist and Dinky lines, as well as new signature models from Phil Collen, Gus G., Marty Friedman, and Misha Mansoor. Picking one favorite would be tough, but Phil Collen\u2019s latest revisions are pretty sweet: The USA Signature Phil Collen PC1 Matte and Satin models have mahogany bodies, bolt-on, two-piece quartersawn, carmelized, flamed maple necks with maple fingerboards and a hand-rubbed urethane gel treatment, compound neck radius (this 12-16\u201d radius thing appears to be the popular norm across the Jackson/Charvel/EVH range), 24 jumbo frets, DiMarzio pickups in an HSS configuration: DP-152-F (bridge), HS-2 DP116 (middle), and PC1 Sustainer Driver (neck), and a Floyd Rose Original tremolo. We especially loved the vibe of the cool satin finishes, blacked-out hardware, and fretboards without markers. \u2014SK Mark Kendrick has been in the music industry for over forty years as a player and builder. His signature pickups are the result of having a definitive taste in mind: a sonic difference from that of a Strat pickup, which he found to be a bit too much on the bright side. He was looking for something with more body and depth while maintaining the compression characteristics of early \u201860s pickups. Through searching raw material resources, trying different wire and magnet combinations along with a calibrated wind for each pickup position, he\u2019s arrived at a pickup that really adds its own voice to the mix. Mark\u2019s other product line includes the Advancing Drive Pedal. Each pedal is hand built by Mark to ensure they meet his every demand for both design and sonic ability. As he states, \u201cMy intention was to build a solid, old school piece.\u201d The pedal can be used as a buffer, drive, boost, and even visit the realms of compression and distortion. Each pedal is also hand painted by Mark, adding that personal touch and creative expression. \u2014DD Kiesel Guitars had a variety of new instruments on display. Many were familiar models sporting gorgeous, multicolored flamed and quilted top finishes (with multiple bindings) that have been featured prominently in the line\u2014and which are being emulated by many other builders these days. The latest model to catch our eyes was the Vanquish KV6C, a 25.5\u201d scale, solidbody electric with a unique, Strat-that\u2019s-been-squished body paired with a Holdsworth-esque headstock. The range of customization options are extensive as with all Kiesel instruments (you can even order this with a multi-scale neck), and we plan to get one of these guitars in for review soon. \u2014SK King Blossom Guitars were showing an interesting hollow-body guitar, the model 1M. You can\u2019t see this particular detail from a photo, but with sound slits on the inside of the horns of the DC instrument, this was definitely different. The mahogany-on-maple build was nice and light but still yielded a nice tone, in part thanks to David Allen Dirty Cats pickups. The guitar also featured a birdseye maple neck, and the product line showed some beautiful pieces of wood. The six-way toggle was also something different, providing a variety of tonal options for split-coil and humbucking pickup configurations. \u2014BS Our pal, Kyle Rhodes, has rebranded Rhodes Amplification as KSR, with styling as hot as the modern amps he has been designing for years. We were excited to see the new Orthos Mk. II combo (his first combo), which puts one of his versatile, two-channel amps into a 2x12 combo configuration, with cleverly applied weight relief and Celestion Neo Creamback speakers. Getting monstrous KSR tone from a 2x12 combo, all-tube amp that weighs under 75 pounds is a beautiful thing indeed. If demand ever lets up for just a minute, we might actually get one of Kyle\u2019s amps in for a formal product review. \u2014SK C.F Martin celebrated 2,000,000 guitars made since 1833. The Two Millionth guitar, as with most of their custom designs, contains some very elaborate inlay work. Much of the same design can be found in the D-200 Deluxe Limited Edition guitar. The dreadnought guitar sports a highly figured Bearclaw Engelmann Spruce top, Brazilian back and sides, and fourteen frets. Also new to the signature line are the Dwight Yoakam DD28 and the D-28 John Prine Dreadnought guitars. Another new product that caught our eye was the OMC-16E, a fourteen-fret, cutaway Orchestra model. Through the RainForest Alliance Certified and FSC initiative, the guitar contains an FSC-certified, Sitka Spruce top with FSC-certified, Cherry back and sides. \u2014DD No stranger to building fantastic sounding, early British-sounding amps, Metropoulos revealed their new 100 Watt Superplex. This amp had a bit less less gain on tap than their Metroplex flagship, but boy did it ROCK! We felt it copped the perfect Hendrix/Cream tone! Variac switch, footswitchable boost and mode options (tonal changes for the mode button), as well as a bypassable effects loop, make this the classic rock Plexi crusher we\u2019ve always dreamed of. Built on the 66 45/100 platform, the amp features kt66 tubes. Keep your eyes open for a spring launch. \u2014BS Mezzabarba was one of the true gems in Hall E this year (Hall E is where all the cool kids hang out). They brought a full compliment of their line, and the amp that really grabbed our ear was the MZero Overdrive. This two-channel, 100 Watt, EL-34 amp had a striking aesthetic, featuring two huge, no-nonsense, red transformers begging to be played staring you in the face. The amp sounded as good as it looked. The clean channel allows for a pristine clean but also offers a switchable boost. The overdrive channel was pure, hot-rodded, Marshall-like bliss, and we\u2019ve just received one in the studio for testing. Full report coming soon! \u2014BS Brian Neunaber was at it again, this time applying his expertise in amplifier design to the Iconoclast, a pedal-based speaker cabinet simulator designed to go at the end of your pedalboard chain and provide a simulated, direct output for live sound or recording. It provides a broad pallette of cabinet tone-shaping options, and a headphone jack, too! \u2014SK John Page, formerly one of the Fender Custom Shop co-founders, is gaining great attention from his Ashburn model guitar, a guitar intended to be \u201cUniquely Familiar.\u201d As expected from a custom built boutique guitar, it's comprised of a double cutaway body with C shaped, threaded bolt neck with contoured heel, staggered tuners, bass side fret markers, and his signature Bloodline pickups (JP-1 single coil S-style pickups). New models include the Ashburn HHS, Ashburn Special, and the AL Special. \u2014DD Peavey introduced the new invective .120 head and invective .212 speaker cabinet. The sharp looking amp was designed with input from Periphery\u2019s Misha Mansoor, and it features four matched JJ6l6GC tubes, three channels, two effects loops, cabinet simulated direct output over XLR, and similar characteristics to the 6505 head other than the new clean channel, which is voiced to be pristine clean. The amp has built-in MIDI control and memory for storing multiple presets, too! Expect a review as soon as it ships. \u2014SK We\u2019ve been reviewing guitars made from non-wood materials for years, but we were never sufficiently moved by non-wood acoustic guitars to pay much attention to them. A funny thing happened over the years, though\u2026 they got better! And this year, playing a few different RainSong acoustic guitars made from carbon fiber, we were genuinely impressed with the tone. These sounded like high-quality acoustic guitars, and the numerous admirable qualities of carbon fiber make it a great choice for building pricey acoustic instruments. How nice to not have to stress over humidity control in your studio or in your guitar hard case all the time! One very cool innovation was that RainSong found a way to cut sheets of carbon with uniform grain structure that looks more like a wood top (albeit in a grey color) than the quilted patchwork that typifies products made from carbon fiber. They call it unidirectional, and claim that it mimics the tight grain structure of spruce. The Concert-series instruments in particular sounded rich and warm. We are looking forward to formally reviewing some RainSong guitars this year. And we\u2019ll say it right now, for those of you who haven\u2019t experienced one of these guitars personally: they don\u2019t sound like hollow, plastic-backed fish bowls! \u2014SK Strymon, best known for its spacey, lush, time-based effects, unveiled a new drive pedal, the Riverside. Packed with interesting features such as an infinite sweet spot, this tailors several parameters under the hood as gain is increased. Input jacks allow for expression pedal control of any of the pedal\u2019s parameters (or simply volume control), and a boost jack allows for a switch to boost your signal. The Level and Drive knobs also offer secondary functions like boost level and noise reduction. The Riverside merges attributes of both analog circuitry as well as DSP with a refreshing, new approach to drive pedals. \u2014BS We were thrilled to see Suhr return to the NAMM Show this year, as it offers a great opportunity to check out so many of their fantastic electric guitars, amps, pickups, and pedals. The A.C.E (or Acoustic Cabinet Emulator) is a new stomp-sized box introduced by Suhr, and its name is pretty self explanatory. This cabinet output emulator provides basic tone shaping with sub, high, and presence controls, as well as including toggles for phase, ground lift, and bypass. It has two balanced outs (both XLR and TRS) and an input attenuator to assure proper levels in and out of the box. We were also excited to see Suhr proudly giving center stage to a new offset guitar body shape, the Classic JM Pro. Offered in many hardware and color combinations, the JM Pro looked and felt every bit a Suhr, and seemed to be a logical style progression in the Suhr guitar family. If you hated the shorter scale offsets of the \u201860s but otherwise enjoyed their vibe, no worries here. These guitars feature a 25.5\u201d scale and all the modern appointments we\u2019ve come to appreciate on Suhr instruments, like locking tuners and single-coil noise-cancellation technology. \u2014BS The masters of cabinet simulation were at it again, this time introducing the Torpedo Captor, an easy-to-use reactive load box. Very straightforward in operation, just plug the appropriate version in-line between your amp and your speaker cabinet and you can activate a -20dB attenuation of the output volume to listen to your pushed amp at reasonable volume levels. The built-in DI lets you connect to your studio gear or house PA system for direct recording or cabinet simulated live sound (switchable for guitar or bass). Just add the free, included Wall of Sound III plug-in to your DAW for a choice of cabinet and mic models when tracking direct. Torpedo Captor handles up to 100W, and there are three models to choose from: 4ohms, 8ohms, and 16ohms. At only $229, it\u2019s a lot less expensive than the full-featured Torpedo Reload and Torpedo Live. \u2014SK You might think that the world has enough pedalboard options, but along comes Ultimate Support, a bit late to the party, but packing exciting new beverages! Introduced were the Genesis Series pedalboards, which offer a few features that are truly innovative! Ultimate started with a pedalboard in the familiar style of a PedalTrain, but then made a few cool changes. First, they integrated a microphone stand base into the top row of the board. For players who struggle with mic boom stands that are too far away once their pedalboards are in place, this is a really great feature, and you can slide the mic base anywhere along the top set of slats. Things get more interesting underneath the board. There\u2019s a universal power supply mount, which accommodates any size/shaped power supply without the need for screws or drilling. And finally, cable management! We\u2019re surprised it took so long for someone to come up with a straightforward way of managing cables underneath, but integrated cable management clips slide along rails underneath the pedalboard. Nice! \u2014SK Although the Dingbat pedalboards can be purchased completely blank and ready for you to add your favorite Voodoo Lab power supply and effects, we especially loved the Voodoo Lab Dingbat PX, which has an integrated Voodoo Lab PX-8 Plus audio looper/switcher attached to the front, providing quick access to pedal loop presets without wasting any space on your pedalboard for the looping system\u2014all wiring takes place underneath the board. \u2014SK"

      "value": "Rock drummers hit hard. It's what we do. And broken sticks are par for the course. Perhaps even more so with mallets, due to the combination of a heavy head and a thin neck. But mallets do come in handy when you're playing some tasty cymbal rises or that groovy 5|4 bolero on the toms during the beginning of Cream's \"White Room.\" Travis Barker from Blink-182 is a hard-hitting rock drummer, and it's clear that he and Zildjian had this in mind when they designed his signature sticks. These are mallets for rock drummers. They're rock drumsticks. They're both. Or so it would seem. At 0.595\" diameter and 16 5/8\" length, they're based on the Zildjian Travis Barker Artist Series drumstick, with an overall length a quarter-inch longer than the stick they're derived from. That puts them at close to the 5B stick size, although these pick up a bit of length due to the mallet on the butt end. They\u2019re heavier overall as well. Both of Travis' stick models feature a fatter neck than a standard 5B, allowing them to endure more abuse than traditional sticks while providing some weight at the stick end to offset the additional weight at the mallet end. The stick end is adorned with a round bead tip. As hickory sticks, they're a bit heaver than a similar size stick in a lighter wood (i.e. maple), but hickory is an excellent choice for all-around durability and playability. We put a pair of these to work in two distinctly different settings: a hard-hitting rock gig and a mellow church service, and we found them better suited to the rock gig. The smallish, tight mallet ends are simply too hard for pianissimo-to-fortissimo cymbal rises. While contemporary gospel players might do well with the stick end of this combo, a 5B-sized stick can be a little hard to manage in any lower-volume situation, and the added weight of these sticks makes them even less suitable. As mallets go, they\u2019re pretty indestructible. But the design does have its drawbacks: unless you're playing with a French timpani grip (thumbs up, fingers underneath), you'll probably find the mallets more than a little intrusive. We found that they tended to smack the underside of our wrists while playing. So there\u2019s the rub: these sticks make great mallets for rock players, but their usefulness as sticks is somewhat limited. Do keep in mind the fact that while the larger bead-style tip will give you lots of definition, you're likely to experience faster head wear if you're a heavy hitter. The white finish looks cool, but you'll get a bit of it on your cymbals unless you just hit them with the tips (which are not painted). It's not a smooth finish, though, and we didn't experience a noticeable loss of grip due to the sticks' coating. Zildjian has made some of its other signature stick models available as a stick/mallet combo, so you might prefer a natural finish alternative. If you're a heavier player who also likes to use mallets from time to time but doesn't want to have to shell out another twenty bucks every time the guitarist calls \"White Room,\" Zildjian's Travis Barker Double mallet might provide the durable solution you've been looking for. With a street price under $20, these are an easy addition to your stick bag."

      "value": "Umlaut Audio may be not be familiar to many keyboard players, but they are certainly on their way. PADS and ARPS are two of their new commercial offerings, after working for years, privately, with leading film scorers such as Danny Elfman. Offering fantastic simplicity, while still presenting a solid feature set, and delivering fresh sounds, Umlaut Audio has introduced two unique virtual instruments that are worth your consideration. PADS is all about pad-type sounds. It is downloadable via the Connect application, is 4.9GB large, and requires Kontakt version 5.5.2 or higher (full or free version). There are over 140 presets, and these are divided via a drop-down menu into three categories: Clean, Complex, and Rhythmic. Sounds are made up of two independent layers, and have multiple filter options with configurable Attack, Release, Cutoff, Resonance and Tune controls for each sound source\u2014in addition to panning and volume controls. A nice touch is the Randomization feature, which allows sound sources to be changed while maintaining the existing configuration parameters. A thirty-two-step sequencer for each of the two sound sources is available, accessible when you click on the MIX/MOD button, which toggles between the two. It looks like this: Also in the modulation section are menus for the ENV and LFO section. While the knobs you turn don\u2019t display any numerical values, the center of the screen indicates your current value, and changes to reflect your adjustments. Effects include a Convolution Reverb, Delay, Modulation (Flanger, Chorus), Distortion, LO-FI (bit crush), and EQ, all with fully configurable parameters. These effects are represented towards the button of the window as icons, and\u2014it\u2019s a minor gripe, but we do wish they were labeled either directly or via tool tips pop-ups when moused over. Once you click on an icon, you see the name of the effect, but more info without clicking would be welcome. So how does PADS sound? Good, and sometimes great! The presets provide solid starting points, but by themselves aren\u2019t necessarily going to make you stop in your tracks. The company\u2019s origin with custom sound design for film composers is obvious, though, as half the pads we explored at the start made us feel like we were scoring Hans Zimmer\u2019s Interstellar (minus the organ). It\u2019s when you start changing the parameters and experiment that the fun really kicks in. The sequencer section was particularly exciting. Even better, if you\u2019re unsure of what to do, there are online videos to help guide you and get you started. Selling for $149, this is a decent deal, and it\u2019s NKS compatible, too, if your studio takes advantage of NI Kontrol-series keyboards. ARPS is an amazingly small 20MB (not GB!) plug-in, with the same method of install and Kontakt requirments as PADS. Just to be clear: this is a percussive instrument, so if you\u2019re expecting wild Jupiter-8 synth arps, you\u2019re looking in the wrong place. There are four \u201cinstruments\u201d within ARPS: kick, mid, tick, and perc, and each one has five presets. The GUI is very similar to PADS (particularly the SEQ window, not surprisingly). The arpeggiator features a configurable, free-draw, 64-step sequencer with latch and seven modes of operation. The pattern can also be modified with Step count, Rate, Release, Swing, Octave count and Repeat controls. ARPS also features seven effects including Filter, Distortion, LO-FI (bit crush), Transient control, Compressor, Delay, and a Spatializer to modify the spread effect of your overall sound. The graphical display is really a breeze to use, allowing you to easily draw your pattern with the mouse. Like PADS, this is where the real creativity comes in for making interesting beats. By opening each instrument and assigning them to the same MIDI channel, a single key can launch a wall of percussive sounds as intricate or simple as you create (and it\u2019s easy to go way beyond the presets). Out biggest disappointment was the lack of synth arps. How cool would it be to have a nice analog synth sound you could so easily manipulate with the user interface? Perhaps integration between PADS and ARPS will be coming in the future. Regardless, the sounds that are included are solid, and should be able to find broad use across the board. Also just like PADS, there\u2019s no label for the effects when you mouse over them. Not a big deal, but helpful to have. ARPS sells for $99, and while not unreasonable, could be considered by some players to be a little high due to the limited sound palette outside of percussion. Nevertheless, there is a lot of potential across multiple genres with what you get. In short, these are two easy-to-use virtual instruments with many good and great sounds. If you tire of the complexity of other soft synths, you may revel in the simplicity of these software interfaces. Sound design is straightforward and\u2026 easy! Umlaut Audio"

      "value": "We are not often asked to review studio furniture, so when we were given the opportunity to check out a cool looking new desk from Zaor, we really didn\u2019t know what to expect. The mammoth and heavy box that arrived for review was surprising, and the gouges in the box were further concerning, but when all was said and done, we were able to successfully assemble the Yesk (not a typo), as shown above, and put it to use in one of our project studios. The Yesk measures 1500x950x852mm (59\u201dx37\u201dx34\u201d), and has eight rack spaces underneath the monitor shelf split into two rows of 4U each. The top shelf accommodates your computer display and monitor speakers; the middle and largest work surface is presumably for your master keyboard controller; the bottom pull-out shelf can hold your computer keyboard and mouse (or another MIDI controller). This shelf shows Zaor\u2019s obvious attention to detail: the shelf is flush with the guide rails on which it retracts, so you could place a MIDI keyboard controller on it that is longer than the actual width of the shelf, and it can still slide most of the way underneath the desktop surface when not in use. Obviously, your setup is your prerogative, and having an open frame design like this allows cables and odd-shaped items to fit wherever you need and be accommodated. Once we peeled back the layers of shipping materials, we found the instruction manual, bag of nuts and bolts, and all the pieces to be put together. This was very Ikea-like from the assembly perspective, right down to the \u201cvague-at-first-instructions-but-easier-once-you-start-doing-it\u201d technique. One gripe we did have was that some of the bolts were not Phillips, but required an Allen key, which was not included in our box. Fortunately, we had a few on hand and were able to proceed. Once assembled, any initial concerns we had about stability dissipated. There was no rocking or swaying. The frame is made from solid Linden wood (a basswood), brushed with copper bristles (by hand!) to give it a rough surface texture, and then light gray and black paint is applied with a special technique that yields a brushed metal look. Sure, the vibe struck us as somewhat reminiscent of \u201880s parachute pants for lack of a better reference. But coupled with the black, melamine-faced shelves, the end result looks quite modern and stylish, and photos fail to do the design justice. We did wish, however, there was an option to add locking casters to the base. While you\u2019re not commonly wheeling desks around, there are times when repositioning equipment can benefit from a desk that can be rolled out of place. Overall, our impression was that this is a good, solid, studio desk that is quite stylish. Allen key and caster quibbles aside, we liked the Yesk. And get this: The Yesk costs $999 including shipping to anywhere in the continental USA or Canada! It isn\u2019t cheap when compared to budget-priced, particle-board furniture, and there are functionally similar products that cost half the price, but quality-wise, this desk is a step up from the cheap stuff, and when you factor in shipping costs, it\u2019s a very nice value overall. Photos don\u2019t adequately capture the unique qualities of the finish\u2014it really is pretty cool looking. If you would like your project studio desk to combine form, functionality, and vibe, we say Yes to the Yesk. Zaor"

      "value": "Two years ago we reviewed the latest revision of the venerable Apex columnar keyboard stand from Ultimate Support. Admittedly, we have personally used these stands since the 1980s, so the Apex is something we were very familiar with. The V-Stand takes on quite a different shape, and recently, Ultimate Support has not only revamped the design, but also introduced an optional second tier. The basic stand can hold up to 150 pounds, and is height-adjustable from twenty-seven to forty inches. The stand weighs just slightly over eighteen pounds, which is heavier than expected when you see its initial, compact size. A cool feature is that the stand can fold down into a smaller configuration for easy transport (see below), and it includes a travel bag. Assembly is a bit more involved than users of the Apex columns are used to, and we had to put a little more sweat equity into putting the V-stand into operation, though this was not difficult. The bottom legs need to be pulled out (width), and the height is adjustable via clamps that snap into place. Each leg has clips to hold cables, continuing the sleek look. The second tier also takes a little bit of effort to set up as well, though again, not too difficult. There are instructions that show you what do to (which includes prying off the plastic end caps of the main stand arms), and with this particular stand, we encourage reading the instructions. The second tier is both height- and angle-adjustable, which is a nice touch. Perhaps coolest of all, there is a leveling window on each clamp to help you get things perfectly balanced (see below): When all is said and done, we liked the V Stand. The obvious advantage of the stand (especially compared with the Apex) is that there is plenty of room for your sustain and effects pedals (yes, keyboard players use those too)! As great as the Apex is, having little room for pedals in front while playing has always been a challenge. Not so with the V Stand. And another advantage over the Apex is that although there is a little more work to set it up, it folds down into a very compact size, which is great for transport or storage when not in use. The only main quibble we had was that there was a little bit of wobble once set up\u2026 because we didn\u2019t fully read the instructions! After discussing our seemingly unstable stand with the good folks at Ultimate Support, we were made aware of a feature we completely overlooked: the V-Stand Pro uses a unique end cap on the support arms (a patented design) that is meant to combat this precise problem. One of the two end caps has an unusual, asymmetrical shape. The idea is, you simply rotate that cap to achieve a desired height/balance adjustment to compensate for any uneven playing surface, essentially an elegant way of putting napkins under a table leg. Now you know\u2014if the stand wobbles on you, there\u2019s a built-in adjustment. Price & Contact Information The V Stand Pro VS-88B sells for $199.99, and the second tier VSIQ-200B sells for $79.99. It\u2019s a solid, modern looking stand that many keyboardists will be happy with, pedals and all. Ultimate Support www.ultimatesupport.com"

      "value": "We know first hand the horror story of our most prized instruments tilting past the point of no return from a cheap stand and falling (in seemingly slow motion) onto the floor of a dingy bar.\u00a0 It makes no sense at all to risk your pricey instruments to inferior, ten-dollar, budget guitar stands. Aptly named for its five-legged design, the Starfish Active guitar stand features something D&A calls an active locking head. The locking head works in two ways. First, the head of the stand has rubber teeth, which firmly grab the headstock of the instrument. Once you release the guitar and allow it to rest on the stand with its own weight, an active, bullet-proof (we did not test bullet resistance claims; we will take their word for it) split gate closes around the headstock, forming a perfect circle for your headstock to sit in. The rest of the stand is a sleek, streamlined design, consisting of metal tubing and plastic, with the exception of the front two legs. As the only other contact point on the guitar, the front legs are covered in T.P.E. plastic (feels like foam), which according to D&A is safe for all finishes. Finally, there is a tab on the back of the stand, which allows you to compact its height for easy breakdown and storage. We put one of our prized Ibanez Jems on the stand. We then proceeded to start to tilt the stand forward, slowly, five degrees at a time. [ ] Once the guitar was at about a 15-20 degrees tilt, it was well off the stand\u2019s front supports. Other stands we own would have undoubtedly lost the guitar already. The headstock of the guitar did not move off of the rubber teeth in the locking head. The guitar, now no longer on a recessed angle, was now standing straight up at a 90-degree angle from the floor. Letting the stand go returned the stand to its standing position. Our budget stands by comparison would have dumped our instrument on the floor. Passing the point of no return pushed the headstock off of the rubber teeth and on to the split gate. As long as the stand wasn\u2019t totally knocked onto the floor, our guitar stayed safe. Easy to use and rock solid, this is easily the best single guitar/bass stand we\u2019ve ever used\u2026 and we intend to keep using it wherever we go. The D&A Guitar Gear Starfish Active Guitar Stand (MSRP $ 89.95) sells for approximately $65. There are certainly more economical options on the market, but do you trust them? This is the one to get."

      "value": "Building pedalboards or racks with clean cable management is a goal that all serious musicians strive to achieve. Cable management keeps everything organized, clean and tidy, reducing accidental tripping over long cable runs, reducing accidental cable breakage, and gives your rig a professional look. Pedal Python does one thing, and it does it well: takes a bundle of your long cables and zips them up into a very tidy snake that is easy to install and works fantastically well. For our latest pedalboard build, we had six cables running from our pedalboard\u2019s RJM Mastermind PCB audio looper/switcher and Voodoo Lab power supply to our amp: instrument out, effects loop send/return, a pair of TRS cables for amp channel switching and a power cable so that our pedalboard could plug into the same backline power conditioner as our amp. In less than twenty minutes, we had a custom-made snake wrapped beautifully around our lengthy cable run. It was the perfect finishing touch for a board we had worked hard to feature a quality, custom cable job throughout. The installation video on Pedal Python\u2019s homepage walks you through the very straightforward process: lay out your cables, cut the snake to length, apply Velcro straps to make cable bundles, slowly feed cables through (feed your power cable with bulky connector first if that\u2019s going into your snake), secure the ends with Zip ties, then apply a larger, fabric Velcro wrap over the Zip ties (eliminating sharp plastic edges that would otherwise cut your hands). Installation instructions were extremely clear, and all of the Velcro wraps and Zip ties that you\u2019ll need are included in the kits, which come in sizes from ten to fifty feet. Important note: the ends of the elastic-like snake can (and will) fray easily if you simply cut the snake to size with scissors. An electric hot knife is recommended, though the average player probably doesn\u2019t have one of those laying around at home. By cutting with very sharp scissors, however, and feeding cables through the un-cut end first, we experienced very little fraying at the other end, and once we applied the final Velcro wrap, everything remained fixed neat and tidy. We love this simple solution and heartily recommend it for anyone who desires to use their own collection of cables rather than having a true \u201ccustom\u201d snake engineered or built. With prices starting under $20, Pedal Python is inexpensive and does a great job. This installation video shows how easily you can install this cable management solution. Pedal Python"

      "value": "Known for their high-quality studio microphones, Blue has now introduced the Spark Digital.\u00a0 Based on the analog Spark studio condenser microphone, Spark Digital offers USB 2.0 and iOS connectivity via interchangeable cables. Like other mics from Blue, Spark Digital is solidly built, sounds great, and should find its way into a number of applications that require high-quality recording on the go. We were impressed by the heft of the mic itself.\u00a0 Not so much that it is so heavy, but rather the construction felt extremely solid.\u00a0 In our reviews of mobile products, there\u2019s typically a lot of plastic in use, but not so with the Spark. It feels like a studio tool (and thankfully sounds like one, too). When you open the box, besides the mic itself, you will find an equally solid tabletop shock mount, instruction booklet, and two sets of connector cables: one containing a USB connector for connecting to your computer, and another containing a 30 pin iOS connector to/from the mic.\u00a0 For those with newer iPhones or iPads, you will either need a Lightning adaptor, or a future connector cable Blue is likely to make. A cool feature is that both cables also provide a headphone jack allowing for zero-latency monitoring, something we think is a very desirable feature. The Spark mic itself has four small blue LED lights on the front to show levels, and underneath that is a combination knob and button that controls the gain, volume, and muting.\u00a0 This also, not surprisingly, glows with a blue LED.\u00a0 On the back of the mic is the Focus Control switch.\u00a0 While set to Off (which is considered Normal Mode), the microphone provides increased low-frequency sensitivity, but while set to On (Focus Mode), there is more upper register sensitivity, intended to provide increased clarity. When the knob light is blue, turning it will control the headphone volume- and this will be reflected in how many of the four LEDs light up.\u00a0 If you hold the knob down for three seconds, all the LEDs change color to orange. This indicates the knob is now controlling the mic gain, which again is reflected in the number of LEDs glowing orange, and adjustable by the knob.\u00a0 You may toggle back and forth (orange and blue) by holding down the button for three seconds. To mute the mic completely (i.e., when our editor in chief tries to sing), simply depress the knob briefly (in either mode) and the LED will flash, indicating the mic is in mute mode. The last item included in the bag of tricks is exactly that- a bag. The included drawstring bag is large enough to carry the Spark even while mounted in the tabletop shock mount (but we don\u2019t recommend transporting it this way for anything but local stuff). For those who like the hard spec numbers: We were very impressed by the shock mount design. No matter what position we put it in, the mic stayed locked in position.\u00a0 We even tried it at ninety degrees\u2014parallel to the floor\u2014and it stayed in position. We fired up Apple\u2019s Garageband on both a MacBook Pro and an iPad 2 to test the Spark Digital.\u00a0 In both cases, it was pretty much plug and play (though you may need to choose your input source in the preferences).\u00a0 We thought for vocals, the Spark delivered a nice, warm sound. The Focus setting was very subtle, at best, but we think it did improve the sound of our intimate, close to the mic, vocal recordings. We did, however, feel that a pop screen should be added for best results with close vocal recordings (if that\u2019s of use for your mobile recording purposes, Blue sells an optional, custom pop filter/shock mount for the mic). We also tried using the Spark Digital mic recording an acoustic guitar, and it captured the tone nicely as well. Finally, we tried the Spark on an acoustic piano, and though our down-and-dirty setup for this was certainly less than ideal, Spark still did a decent job of capturing our performance in a \u201clive\u201d kind of way. Really, it was nice hearing studio-quality audio through fully mobile recording technology. If you\u2019re a podcaster this mic seems a bit over the top quality-wise, but certainly, if used in that capacity and recording in a quiet room, you\u2019ll deliver broadcast quality podcasts with minimal effort. For direct-to-USB recording, the Spark Digital made us feel anything but blue. Blue Spark Digital: $199.95"

Now we\u2019ve got EP-4, and it\u2019s a worthy upgrade. With more sounds, more effects, and a new interface for better organization (just a small gripe about the on-screen virtual knobs being a little small), there\u2019s even more to like than before. If you were a fan before, you\u2019ll like it even more now! We certainly did. for an in-depth look at Lounge Lizard; here we will focus on the new features of EP-4 version 4.0.1: The interface was previously split across two screens; now it is three. The Play screen, pictured above, is where you select your presets and have access to basic parameters. The Edit screen gives you access to fine-tuning, including hammer stiffness, noise, pickup, tine, and damper parameters, as well as the tremolo control (an essential ingredient for many electromechanical piano recordings). Finally, the FX screen provides access to effects, including the equalizer, compressor, delay, chorus, reverb, wah-wah, phaser, distortion, and notch filter. Within each screen, there are some new things from the previous version. The most obvious is that there are more sounds! Over 200 presets are included to get you started. We appreciated that the names themselves are now a little more descriptive than before (instead of Rhodes 1, Rhodes 2, etc.) and there is a Manage button that reveals a pull-down menu to quickly access the preset you want. Included are a compressor, equalizer, limiter, and new effects, and we liked the new \u201ccharacter\u201d control which gives the choice of five emulations of signal paths: the cabinet, preamp, microphone and recorder chain that follows the piano output. Installation was painless, and the install consumed less than 12 MB, which is remarkable considering all the multi-gigabyte sample libraries out there. We did wish that some of the virtual, on-screen knobs and their labels were larger. However, you can make the argument that if you MIDI assign them to a controller, you will be using a hardware control instead of the on-screen control, so it becomes less of an issue. Alternatively, if the window allowed for user re-sizing, that could help too. A small gripe, for sure, but something that we suspect a number of users would appreciate. In the center of the application window, there is a little arrow you can click which reveals\u2026 a manual! It gives some history of electromechanical pianos, and of course the use of the software itself. At 52 pages, it\u2019s one of the more complete manuals out there, which is ironic given how limited your need for the manual actually is with this easy-to-use soft synth. As we said earlier, if you liked EP-3, you\u2019re going to really like EP-4. For those who are new to Lounge Lizard, you really should check it out. While everyone\u2019s taste is different when determining what the \u201cbest\u201d sound is, EP-4 gives you plenty of great-sounding presets, which are all editable to your taste. As in previous versions, there is a \u201cClassic Tracks\u201d section for you to choose pianos emulating famous recordings from Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Queen, and Supertramp. Good stuff, with the very welcome addition of modern effects processing. Lounge Lizard EP-4: $199 USD. Upgrades from EP-1, -2, -3: $39. Apple Acoustic Systems"

      "value": "\u201cHey man, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have a wrench on you? How about a blade? I really need to get this thing fixed before the first song. Oh no, I need a screwdriver, quick!\u201d As working musicians both on the local and national circuits, we\u2019re sure that all of us have run into situations like this, sometimes multiple times a night at the worst possible moments. Since what can go wrong will go wrong, having a set of tools with you on the gig is essential. As if us drummers don\u2019t have enough to worry about at a live gig. The team at MusicPlayers.com is always interested in discovering new tools that make our musical lives easier, and if you\u2019re the kind of drummer who leans towards accident prone, then the American Recorder Technologies\u2019 Drummer\u2019s Wrench is something you\u2019ll want to keep in your gig bag or on your belt. The Drummer\u2019s Wrench resembles a Swiss Army knife and features a drum key, \u00be\u201d adjustable box wrench, 2\u201d knife blade, 2\u201d saw blade, a slotted screwdriver, a Phillips screwdriver, bottle opener, scissors, and a belt holster. It is made of stainless steal and has a solid, rubber grip. Each of the eight individual components would be handy to have on a gig. For instance, a blade may be useful to cut anything from cable ties to very heavy-duty tape. Loose screws on mic stands or drum hardware can always be a problem and are easily remedied with the right tool. And let\u2019s not forget the most important of the included features: a bottle opener. Sure, this might be one of the more cumbersome bottle openers by design, but the tool might be a great attention getter or icebreaker at the bar. Let\u2019s see the guitar player top this with his little Allen keys!!! All kidding aside, the standout feature, and thus the part that truly makes this a drummer\u2019s tool, is the tuning key. It\u2019s almost hysterical how many of these get lost by drummers. However, the importance of having at least one around cannot be overstressed. As they seem to have legs of their own, attaching one to a multipurpose tool makes it easier not to misplace. However, because of the bulkiness of the Drummer\u2019s Wrench compared to a standard drum key, it may pose a usability problem when trying to get into tight places where lugs have come loose during the course of a show. We mention this because it has happened all too many times. We were disappointed with the action on the box wrench, as the adjuster kept getting jammed in a number of different positions. The Drummer\u2019s Wrench sells for $29.95, which we feel is typical pricing for this sort of utility device. Overall, The Drummer\u2019s Wrench is great idea that could use a few refinements in its design. Perhaps if the drum key were placed on the end of the tool it could allow for longer/better reach into tight spaces, and if there were any way to add a couple of Allen keys in place of a knife blade, that would enhance its usefulness. Feature requests asside, we\u2019d still rather have this handy tool with us than not. Drummer's Wrench: $29.95 American Recorder Technologie"

      "value": "Imagine that you\u2019re playing a show and feeding off the contagious energy of the audience. The crowd is so loud that you can\u2019t hear yourself, so you begin to dig into your kit a little deeper. They can take it, so you dish it out. You get to the bridge of the tune and lay into a steady four on the floor. You close your eyes and revel in the moment when all of the sudden, something doesn\u2019t feel right. Is the stage rumbling from the energy in the room? No. Soon, reality hits you and you are reminded that you forgot your drum rug. As a result, your bass drum has decided that it needs some space in your relationship, just a hair out of reach of your foot. Wait! This second scenario gets better. Here, you realize that the crowd is really feeling your band and you have, yet again, forgotten your rug. Better yet, those in charge of the backline forgot to tell you that the kit had no throne. Now, you are stuck with your kick drum tied with rope to the back of the folding chair you are playing on. We think that by this point, the sanctity of a good drum rug is important. American Recorder Technologies has their own unique answer to this problem in the Drumsetter drum mat, and while we feel that it is an admirable product (does the job and is super-comfy), we find the Drumsetter best suited to players on gigs where they aren\u2019t pressed for time at setup, and for studio/session use. The Drumsetter is essentially not a rug, but rather a bundle of smaller pads \u2014 six 2\u2019x2\u2019 interlocking square sheets that make up a 4\u2019x6\u2019 rug, constructed of a combination industrial grade stain resistant carpet and \u00bd\u201d closed-cell foam. The outer edges of each segment are beveled for a smooth transition from the rug to the stage floor. The rug\u2019s design is intended to resist the movement of your drums, protect the floor beneath, and provide dampening of unwanted noise and vibration. The underside of each panel has directional arrows to ensure proper setup, and the segments come in a carrying case for easy transport. Carrying our drum rug in a gig bag of its own is certainly a nicer, cleaner alternative than rolling up a dirty drum rug and throwing that in our car (or worse, hauling it through New York City on the subway). We found the Drumsetter only took us a few minutes to assemble, but under the stress of a lightning-fast setup at a club gig, we would still lean towards simply throwing down a one-piece drum rug. As anyone who has played a rock gig with multiple bands on the bill in Los Angeles or New York City knows, every minute of setup time matters, and having to first assemble a rug is a luxury many of us can\u2019t afford. For our cover band gigs, though \u2014 where we\u2019re setting up to play multiple sets over the course of an evening, setup time is a non-issue. Aside from being used as a drum rug, American Recorder Technologies suggests that the Drumsetter could also be used as stage rug for standing players, and it comes in other sizes in order to suit various configurations (in case you\u2019ve got a nice triple kick drum 13-piece setup for your \u201880s hair band tribute act). Finally, the package comes with a drum key and belt clip (as we all know how easy it is to loose those). It should be reiterated that once the carpet was assembled, it held our drums quite well. And for other musicians, we observed that standing on the rug felt very comfortable. On the American Recorder website, the claim is made that the Drumsetter is the \u201c\u2026 easiest to use and most portable drum rug ever made.\u201d We can\u2019t agree with it being the easiest \u2014 it\u2019s a rug with some assembly and tear-down required, but it is indeed highly portable, with none of the nasty, dirty side effects of hand-carrying a beer stained, dirty and dusty rug. We do support their claim that this is the \u201cmost comfortable drum rug ever made\u201d \u2014 or one of them, at least. For studio use, it\u2019s a great choice for both the comfort and the dampening that it provides (the latter of which is likely to go unnoticed on a live stage). But for the busy gigging musician, we think it\u2019s going to be up to you to decide if the extra setup time is worth it or not. Drumsetter $99.95 American Recorder Technologie"

      "value": "We love racks loaded up with music gear, but hate moving them (or more specifically, lifting them in and out of our vehicles for personal transport). If you\u2019re like us, you\u2019re always looking at how you can shave a pound or two here and there, since a ten pound difference (or more) overall can make transporting your own equipment a much more pleasant experience. Calzone has been one of the leading manufacturers of custom music cases to the pro audio and touring industries for decades. If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cYeah, but Anvil is better,\u201d relax, as they are both the same company, just operating under different names on each coast to preserve the history of each brand since their first customers aren\u2019t quite dead yet, though probably still sporting silvery gray mullets. Typically constructed from layers of plywood with steel hardware, bracing, rails, rugged locking casters, etc. and (in the case of shock racks) packed with dense foam inserts, Calzone cases deliver whatever level of protection your gear requires, and the company can build any case you can dream of. We own Escort-series cases of theirs manufactured almost twenty years ago that are still just as rugged as when we ordered them, and the foam lining in one 76-key keyboard case hasn\u2019t even deteriorated! We\u2019re big fans of cases made from poured plastic molds since those tend to be just as protective as their plywood alternatives at a fraction of the weight, but those do have their limitations and just aren\u2019t suited to all tasks. First, the hardware is typically of a lighter grade best suited to local transport. And second, if you\u2019ve ever tried to attach anything to the walls or covers of those plastic cases (either mounting equipment to interior side walls or placing some cool stickers on the covers), you\u2019ve probably ended up disappointed. Not much fun for custom/complex rig installations. Imagine our excitement to learn that Calzone introduced rack cases that blur the lines between these seemingly disparate worlds of wooden cases and plastic. Made from XLT-1 Polypropylene, a corrugated plastic composite cut in sheets and installed like a traditional plywood case, these new rack cases deliver the best of both worlds: the usability of wooden cases (with some actual improvements) with a real weight saving advantage. And, they\u2019re eco friendly too! XLT material is available in 1/4\u201d, 3/8\u201d, or \u00bd\u201d density (the later by sandwiching two layers of \u00bc\u201d XLR together) and comes in blue, black, or a black tread plate pattern. Handing samples of the material, it is extremely robust, with just the slightest flex to the \u00bc\u201d material. Place a pair of sheets together for \u00bd\u201d thickness and you can\u2019t flex them at all (that\u2019s about it for our \u201cscientific\u201d rigidity testing). As we were getting ready to build a new effects rack for our guitar rig, this proved to be the perfect opportunity to check out the new material, and we ordered a \u201ctypical configuration\u201d for effects rack purposes: \u00bc\u201d XLT, 10U rack spaces, 18\u201d depth, rear rails installed, heavy duty locking casters, dual handles on each side. The case features familiar Calzone construction: pneumatically machine-driven steel split rivets, tapered aluminum edging, zinc plated steel corners, latches and handles, tongue-in-groove valance extrusions, and rivets only in a handful of locations where absolutely necessary. One of the coolest things about these cases \u2014 definitely a unique feature compared with other builders, is that rather than rely upon wooden shims between the exterior case and the rack rails, Calzone uses a high-density foam shim. This subtle difference adds a touch of shock absorption to the case without it truly being a shock rack. Everything can\u2019t be perfect in the world, but fortunately our only gripe with the case is extremely minor. Because of the foam shims, the spacing from left to right in our case was just barely off enough that we couldn\u2019t use our beloved Humfrees rack isolation tabs when mounting our gear in the case. But Calzone provided a bag of steel screws with plastic washers, so all was not lost. We love this XLT material! Another cool difference over plywood cases besides the obvious weight savings: a smooth finish on the inside of the case! Because adhesive materials do stick to the XLT material, we were able to Velcro our Voodoo Labs Pedal Power 2 Plus power supply for a pedal shelf to the interior of the case, as well as our RJM Mini Line Mixer, thus not wasting precious space on our shelf with the pedals. Alternately, you can actually drill into the material, too. In the end, our case ended up weighing only 46 pounds, a 15% weight savings vs. construction with \u00bc\u201d plywood. The raw XLT material is 30% lighter than plywood of equal size, but all of the steel hardware is the same, and the caster board was made from plywood, so the larger the case you order, the greater the percentage of overall weight savings will be. And if you\u2019re outfitting multiple musicians in your band for touring, the weight savings could add up to better fuel efficiency or lower shipping/freight charges. It should be noted that while the XLT material is ideal for effects rigs, it is not useful for rack cases that hold amplifiers, so if you\u2019ve got rack-mounted guitar tube preamps and power amps, those are still best suited to traditional shock rack cases. Because the XLT material is plastic instead of wood, over time, the extra heavy weight of power amps could stretch the holes through which the rails are attached to the side walls, thus loosening them. But for your rack gear and shelves with boutique pedals, no worries. Keyboard players would also be well advised to check out the XLT material, assuming they aren\u2019t sticking power amps in the bottom of their rack cases. If our effects rack isn\u2019t quite what you need, racks constructed with XLT are available in sizes ranging from 2U to 10U in non-shock style (like the case we reviewed here) or 2U to 8U in the shock mount. The Calzone Escort XLT rack as configured here sells for only $575. And here\u2019s a real treat: order this case just as we spec\u2019d out (ok, go ahead and choose black if you must), and mention discount code MP10. MusicPlayers.com readers get a 10% discount on the case. Not quite what you need? This discount code may be applied to any XLT rack cases offered! Happy holidays! Calzone Case Co."

      "value": "Pedaltrain 3 Pedalboard, emptyWe\u2019ve been huge fans of Pedaltrain pedalboards for years. In fact, we regard them as the benchmark against which we judge all others (see our review of the original Pedaltrain Pro here). In the new Pedaltrain 3, we\u2019ve found more cause for celebration. The Pedaltrain 3 is sized in between the Pedaltrain 2 and the Pedaltrain Pro, making it \u201cjust right\u201d for players who thought the Pro was just way too big, but for whom the Pedaltrain 2 was just a bit too cramped. With dimensions of 24\u201d x 16\u201d x 3.75\u201d, the Pedaltrain 3 is perfect for mid-sized pedalboards that include a variety of pedals, a floor-based looper, and perhaps an amp footswitch. It is made from the same rugged and lightweight aluminum as other Pedaltrain pedalboards, and the Pedaltrain 3 weighs a mere 4.5 lbs. The opening underneath the Pedaltrain 3 is sized to perfectly accommodate mounting a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus underneath anywhere you prefer (left, right, near middle, etc.), and a set of brackets for mounting your power supply is included with the pedalboard. Velcro is provided as always, and we had no trouble applying it to the entire surface of the pedalboard. Once you\u2019ve applied the Velcro to the Pedaltrain, you can easily place your pedals anywhere on the surface as needed\u2026 and that\u2019s where the fun really begins. Thankfully, these pedalboards are both rugged and extremely lightweight, because once you load them up with pedals and a power supply, they can definitely start to tip the scale. The Pedaltrain Booster accessories are three different sized platforms that literally give your pedals a lift off the surface of your pedalboard. The idea is to make it easier to step on pedals on different rows of your pedalboard, and they work great! Be sure to apply the included Velco in the same orientation as you\u2019ve done on your pedalboard. We recommend putting the loop (soft) side of the Velcro on the surface of the Pedaltrain pedalboard as well as on top of the Booster, and use the hook (hard) side of the Velcro on the bottom of your pedals and the bottom of the Boosters. This arrangement made it a breeze for us to reconfigure the layout of our pedals. With three different size Boosters, you can lift standard-sized pedals individually, double-wide pedals, or a combination of pedals, and depending on the direction in which you place the Booster, your pedals can be raised at an angle or without any pitch. The PT-PB1 measures 3.5\u201d x 5.5\u201d x 1\u201d\u201d, the PT-PB2 measures 7\u201d x 5.5\u201d x 1\u201d, and the PT-PB3 measures 10\u201d x 5.5\u201d x 1\u201d, but we recommend purchasing PT-PBK, a combination pack that includes one of each sized Booster. The Pedaltrain PT-3 HC includes a hard case (26 lbs.) with built-in wheels and a pull handle, whie the PT-3 SC comes in a padded gig bag (8 lbs.). We recommend the hard case for larger Pedaltrain configurations like the 3 or Pro, because once these pedalboards get loaded up, the gig bag gets very heavy! At least you can wheel the hard case around. Pedaltrain PT-3 HC (MSRP $459.95) sells for approximately $270 street. Pedaltrain PT-3 SC (MSRP $239.95) sells for approximately $140 street. PT-PB1 (MSRP $19.95) sells for approximately $13 street. PT-PB2 (MSRP $24.95) sells for approximately $17 street. PT-PB3 (MSRP $29.95) sells for approximately $20 street. PT-PBK (MSRP $59.95) sells for approximately $40 street. Pedaltrain"

Our favorite rack shelf when weight is a concern and we\u2019ve got tons of pedals to rack, the VS1 takes only 1U of space, is made from lightweight but strong plastic (only 7.5 pounds!), snaps securely in place when retracted, and\u2026 has a hook and loop surface built right into the shelf! In testing, we had no trouble sticking pedals to the padded surface of the shelf, taking gear right off of our pedal boards and transplanting the effect units to our rack for safer keeping (not to mention remote operation via an audio looper installed in our rack). There\u2019s a small latch on the face that snaps the shelf in place, but there\u2019s plenty of friction to the rolling mechanism as it is \u2014 even without fully retracting the shelf, we haven\u2019t found that it slides in or out of place after months of use. The padded surface area measures 14.5\u201d x 14.5\u201d, and you\u2019ll want to allow 2-3 spaces in total in your rack to actually accommodate placing pedals on the shelf. The SKB-VS1 (MSRP $154.99) sells for under $90, making it a no-brainer if you want to rack your pedals. It lacks anchor points for screwing into in the rear of your rack \u2014 like some other shelves that each weigh at least a few pounds more, so you\u2019ll want to reserve use of this product for pedals and other lightweight items.

      "value": "Capos are cool. In a world where so many guitar players are looking to drop their tunings, a capo heads in the other direction and really opens you up to a world of new sounds from your guitar \u2014 especially when applied to an electric guitar in a rock music setting. We\u2019ve been using capos for well over a decade and have seen our fair share of different capo designs. The recently introduced Newport capo from G7th gets our vote as the coolest capo ever designed for use on electric guitars. The low profile, rounded, brushed aluminum design screams iPhone, but is vastly more useful when mated to the neck of your guitar. It\u2019s also extremely light in weight and doesn\u2019t require a service agreement. While many capos have a bulky design, and our previous favorite was large enough that it could (on occasion) obstruct our fretting hand when playing in the first position, the Newport\u2019s design renders it not much larger than an oversized \u201czero fret.\u201d At a glance, someone might not even notice that you\u2019ve got a capo on your guitar! The Newport clamps onto your guitar neck easily with its very cool pivoting hinge, and a small thumbscrew enables you to easily adjust tension. The tension control is an absolute necessity in our book \u2014 particularly for capos used on electric guitars, since these instruments have widely varying neck thicknesses. Too much tension can easily pull the pitch of your notes sharp, while too little tension can decrease sustain of your notes. Be sure to adjust the tension of your capo so that it\u2019s comparable with the force you normally apply when fretting your guitar by hand. The fretting surface of the Newport capo is a familiar hard rubber material, and should it ever wear down, G7th provides a lifetime warranty on their capos. There was no perceptible loss of tone or sustain when using the Newport on a variety of different electric guitars. It should be noted that for best results, you\u2019ll want to use both hands when applying this capo or moving it from one fret to another. Single-handed operation is a bit awkward given the diminutive stature of this device. At $39.95, this is one accessory anyone can afford to add to his or her electric guitar rig. Whether you\u2019re writing your own original material or covering some classic singer/songwriter tunes from the \u201870s, this is one monster capo that has no business at a jazz festival. Still, Newport has a nicer ring to it than calling this device the iCapo. G7th"

      "value": "Players with custom pedalboards and/or lots of rack gear turn to custom cabling solutions whenever they want the cleanest installation and highest quality sound from their guitar and bass rigs. Cutting cables to just the right length gives you a tidy solution with the highest degree of audio quality as your signal doesn\u2019t pass through extra feet of unused cable. There are a handful of companies making custom cable solutions for the do-it-yourself rig builder, and while they all boast outstanding audio quality, the guitar gear editors at MusicPlayers.com proclaim the Planet Waves Cable Station solution our hands-down favorite of the bunch. The tested Cable Station Custom Cable Kit includes fifty feet of uncut Planet Waves instrument cable. This is great sounding instrument cable, and we use Planet Waves standard, soldered cables for guitar-to-amp connections whenever we\u2019re not running around wireless. The kit also includes four straight plugs, six right-angle plugs, and a mini cable cutter. Assembly of the cables is one part of what makes this solution so fantastic. With ease, we cut cables with the supplied cutter, inserted them into the extremely heavy-duty plugs, pushed and twisted gently, then turned a set screw in the side of the plug until it turned no further. Voil\u00e0! You should always test your cables before installing them into a rig, but we achieved 100% success on the first try with these cables, a feat we never matched with any other cable solution this side of a soldering iron. If there aren\u2019t enough plugs included in the kit for your wiring project, you can order extras \u00e0 la carte from the Planet Waves online store or other retailers. The intention of this kit (based on the ratio of plugs-to-cable) seems to be to connect just a few pedals and then to make some lengthy instrument cables, but although these cable connections are extremely solid, we recommend sticking to cables with soldered ends wherever you find yourself repeatedly plugging and unplugging cables. For permanent installations like your rack or your pedalboard, though, have no fear \u2014 these custom cables rock. Just plan to order a few extra connectors along with the kit, which at $80 street (MSRP $150) is a fantastic value. If you\u2019re just wiring up a pedalboard, also consider the Cable Station Pedalboard Cable Kit. This less expensive kit includes ten feet of uncut cable and ten right-angle plugs for $60 street.

      "value": "We recently reviewed a Jackson Soloist USA guitar and were extremely impressed by the custom-designed hard case it shipped in. Knowing that the case was of SKB origin, we set out to discover if the fantastic case was available as an after-market accessory for other guitars. Sure enough, we found the nearly identical SKB-66 case and purchased a few of them for ourselves. The SKB-66 accommodates right and left-handed Stratocaster and Telecaster style guitars, and is made from SKB\u2019s familiar plastic shell over a foam core with plush padding that cradles the guitar like a pair of cozy slippers. At just over ten pounds, it has a solid feel to it but is light enough for easy transport. The redesigned case features larger external bumpers around the corners than the previous generation case, and a rubber-covered handle lets you grip the case with authority. SKB TSA-approved security locksMost important to the gigging artist are a few key features. First, these cases feature TSA-approved locks, so you can securely lock your case before the baggage handlers at the airport do their famous luggage acrobatics with your prized axe. Also, the fiberglass-reinforced, nylon trigger latches are a new design that is definitely more rugged than found on the previous generation case. If you have an older generation SKB guitar case, you\u2019ll instantly notice the more refined and rugged construction of the new design. The other feature we loved: exterior stacking points. The case is sculpted externally so that multiple guitar cases can stack very securely on top of one another without risk of your guitar sliding off the pile and crashing to the ground. We might have overlooked this important feature had we not purchased a few of these cases, but players with multiple instruments on the road will really welcome this detail. Inside, the case is notched at the bottom for the strap peg on the bottom of your guitar, so the instrument rests with its butt flat against the case, critical if you tend to stack cases vertically or when being handled for transport. There\u2019s a large cutout that can accommodate a strap and various accessories, but it lacks a cover. Fortunately, the top of the case is formed to cover the compartment, and we haven\u2019t experienced any items falling out of the compartment, which could otherwise ding your prized instrument. We put the case to use with a variety of guitars to see what kind of a fit could be achieved. Marketed for Strat-type guitars, we put a USA Fender Strat and a Japanese Squire Strat into the case and they fit perfectly without any wiggle room. But we also wanted to see how the case fared with a variety of other guitars. The case worked well with Ibanez RG-series guitars, a Music Man JP-6, and a Gary Kramer Guitars Cathedral Deluxe (Strat-style boutique guitar), but the fit wasn\u2019t initially snug enough on its own to instill confidence. There was enough wiggle room that would have enabled these guitars to shift by more than an inch or two in a few directions (which could have damaged them in transit), but by simply gluing or taping two or three pieces of foam inside the case (one along the edge of the body cavity, one where the guitar\u2019s upper horn rests, and one at the headstock), we easily eliminated the risk of movement with about two minutes of work and created a totally custom fit. The SKB-66 case (MSRP $209.99) sells for under $130, a good price for such a nicely made case. If you don\u2019t mind making a tiny tweak to customize the fit, it will work great with many Strat-style guitars, and we definitely prefer our modded SKB-66 to the \u201cvintage\u201d style case that ships with many of our favorite boutique guitars. If you\u2019re looking for extreme guitar protection, a nineteen-pound, injection-molded ATA-rated case is available, too. This impressive case (not reviewed here, but we have examined it) has a handle on one end, wheels on the other, and in the event of a water landing, can be used as a floatation device or a surfboard.

      "value": "When we reviewed the Mono M80 dual-guitar gig bags, their functionality, design, and level of gear protection blew us away. Mono set the benchmark against which we judge gig bags for guitars and basses. We have yet to encounter a gig bag we like more, and at least half of our editorial team now owns at least one Mono case. So when Mono introduced a new line of guitar and bass straps, we couldn\u2019t wait to see what founder/designer Daniel Kushner did with this otherwise familiar item that we all use. We took three different straps from the GS-1 line for a spin on our guitars: The Betty, The Doolittle, and The Warsaw. The straps are beautifully constructed and feature minimalist styling \u2014 very basic patterns and earthy solid colors, and they are constructed from a few different materials that make each of these models special in its own way. The Betty is an ideal strap for bassists and players with heavy electric guitars. This strap has fabric on top, a thin memory-foam core for padding, and neoprene on the under-side. We loved the feel of this strap, as it makes wearing a solid mahogany body electric guitar feel much more pleasant. However, a bassist friend of ours who likes to play with instruments higher on his body than we\u2019d consider \u201ccool\u201d wasn\u2019t able to adjust this particular strap short enough for his tastes. We didn\u2019t even notice the cool, hidden holder for picks (or a slide) on the strap until we read about it on the Mono website. The Doolittle is more of a general-purpose strap, and a good choice for players who like the feeling of cloth more than the feeling of \u201cstrap.\u201d The two-inch wide cotton weave was soft to the touch, and the strap length was adjusted from an understated but totally stylish metal buckle, shaped in the style of Mono\u2019s logo. The strap appears traditional at first glance, but modern with its little details. The devil is in those details, you know\u2026 Finally, we adorned our guitar with the Warsaw strap, made from automobile seat belt material. If you\u2019re the musician who considers guitar or bass playing a life saving experience, how can you resist this one? We wouldn\u2019t have expected it to feel comfortable, yet we wear a seatbelt in our car for hours every week without ever complaining about the feel. Sure enough, this strap was almost frictionless against our clothing, and there\u2019s probably zero chance of it ever just breaking or tearing. The stylish buckle was present on this strap, too (but not at all on the Betty strap). All of the strap ends are made from industrial rubber instead of leather, and they are so strong that we had trouble installing the straps on some of our guitars. We were actually scared that we might break off a strap peg on at least one guitar the fit was so tight. Regrettably, we can\u2019t imagine using one of these straps with a strap lock system because there just doesn\u2019t seem to be enough give in the openings. We\u2019re not sure how simple it would be to drill out the holes in the industrial rubber, but that might prove to be a workable option. The GS-1 straps (MSRP $50) can each be purchased for $39.99 directly from the Mono website. If you appreciate understated beauty or simplistic elegance, you owe it to your guitar or bass to pick up one of these expertly crafted straps. Mono Hybrid Cases"

      "value": "Semi-hollowbody guitars seem to be making a comeback, especially with younger artists today. We can remember The Beatles and other classic bands from the Fifties and Sixties sporting these large, chambered guitars. Not only are they seen in pop and jazz settings, but now they\u2019ve made their way back into the realm of rock n\u2019 roll. Not all semi-hollowbody guitars have what it takes to stand in front of a Marshall or other high gain amplifier without squealing like a pig and sounding as muddy as that pig in a mud bath, but The Taylor T3/B isn\u2019t like those other semi-hollowbodies. The T3/B would make Wilbur do back flips while Charlotte weaved messages into her web saying \u201cRockin\u2019\u201d and \u201cOh Yeah!\u201d The Taylor T3/B provides everything we\u2019ve come to expect from a Taylor electric-acoustic guitar, and all the standard behavior we\u2019d expect to get from a semi-hollowbody. But\u2026 don\u2019t be afraid to plug this one into your rock rig, as it just may surprise you. This is one bad chameleon, able to sip tea with the jazz and pop crowd and then down shots of Jaeger with the rock gods. And we haven\u2019t even talked about the dreamy Bigsby tremolo, either! The Taylor T3/B is, in essence, an offspring of the Taylor T5 acoustic-electric and the Taylor SolidBody electric. In keeping with some very key design points that inspired its predecessors, the T3/B contains the same body design and neck as the T5 mated to the electronics (pickups) from the Taylor SolidBody collection. Our review model (the /B) also sported a cool Bigsby tailpiece. Specifications are as follows: Taylor loves to create their own electric guitar hardware, and in the case of the T3/B, they took a classic Bigsby tremolo and improved upon the design. Rather than attaching the Bigsby to a fixed bridge (traditional approach), they created a roller bridge so that the strings bend over a rotating end piece instead of the hard edge of a fixed bridge. The end result is designed to provide for better tuning stability and less wear on the strings at the point of contact. Like all of the Taylor guitars we\u2019ve reviewed, the T3/B provided excellent playability. There\u2019s just something special about a Taylor neck and string action that is rarely matched straight from the factory (especially on acoustic instruments). If you\u2019re an accomplished player looking for one guitar that provides versatility and is able to adapt to almost any playing situation, look no further (it\u2019s not the right instrument for metal guys). The T3/B provides a multitude of tones that include acoustic, electric, single coil, double coil, full-bodied jazz tones, and any combination thereof. For the weekend warrior playing a variety of styles, this is one guitar that can cover just about anything, all with an exceptional tone as well. You won\u2019t feel like you sacrificed anything by leaving your prized collection at home. The Bigsby vibrato tailpiece is a favorite of many jazz players. The only problem is that they usually have tuning issues and performance tends to be inconsistent. Not so with the Bigsby on the T3/B. Equipped with Taylor\u2019s custom Roller Bridge, we found that this Bigsby provided smooth vibrato without any tuning issues. The single Master Volume control and Master Tone control provided some limitation only when blending the neck and bridge pickup together. However, there were so many other options due to the push/pull operations of the controls that we didn\u2019t miss the other two knobs at all. And with the capability to split the coils and engage a second tone stage, we had more tone options at our fingertips than we could possibly make use of. Taylor\u2019s control knobs for volume and tone include optional rubberized O-rings that fit around the knobs to provide extra grip for non-slip pinky control moves. The lip on the top of the knob also provides extra grip for push/pull action. We test-drove our Taylor T3/B through a Bogner Ecstasy, which provided an excellent clean tone without robbing the guitar of its true colors. The T3/B delivered everything you would expect from a Taylor. The humbucking pickups provided excellent attack and clarity in the clean channel of the amp. In the bridge pick-up, the sound was crisp and clear but slightly mellow due to the semi-hollowbody configuration. You can definitely hear the slight hint of an acoustic guitar in the tone. Switching to the neck pickup provided a deep, rich open tone. And with the second tone stage engaged via the Tone knob, we were able to achieve an excellent mellow jazz tone that would make any jazz artist proud. Engaging the coil splitter via the volume control knob really expanded our options, giving us a multitude of tonal colors. Not only did it provide a single coil strat-like sound, but also provided an additional acoustic guitar characteristic. Combining the coil split and second tone stage along with the various three way pickup selector options, the tonal spectrum of this guitar seemed endless. Enough of the pretty stuff, though. If you\u2019re keeping up with music videos and what guitarists are playing today, you\u2019ll notice a lot of young artists using semi-hollowbody guitars. They looks cool, but still need to have a great rock edge and tone. The Taylor T3 didn\u2019t let us down there, either. Positioned on the bridge pickup and with everything wide open, this guitar had a voice to be heard. The sound was cutting edge and still remained smooth and sustaining, unlike some semi-hollowbodys that just turn into mud or feedback squeal with the addition of overdrive. The coil tap added an additional crunchy tone for a vintage vibe. And if you love playing fusion, it\u2019s all in there. The T3 provided everything from a subtle bite to a mellow singing voice for the jazz-fusion enthusiast. The Taylor T3/B includes a tech specs sheet, info about the Elixer strings, warranty information, etc. The Taylor website provides excellent information regarding the guitar\u2019s Push/Pull knob operation and other components of the guitar. The Taylor T3/B (MSRP $3,398.00) we reviewed sells for approximately $2,500. The guitar isn\u2019t cheap, but you\u2019re getting a beautiful custom top and Taylor engineering on an instrument whose fit and finish are superb, not to mention a cool guitar case covered in faux alligator skin! If you don\u2019t need a Bigsby Tailpiece, the T3 with traditional stop tailpiece starts at approximately $2,400.00 street. Taylor offers a number of color options including Tobacco Sunburst, Honey Sunburst, Natural or Red Edgeburst along with a Stop Tailpiece or optional Bigsby/Roller Bridge. Taylor Guitars"

      "value": "I don\u2019t know what it is, but people in the studio just can\u2019t seem to keep their hands off of my knob. It\u2019s solid, silky smooth, and\u2026 brushed aluminum, you know. Yes, folks, never before have we had the pleasure of reviewing a piece of gear so ideally suited to a pornographic product introduction, but keeping our mind in the gutter for just another moment, we have to say that this is one smokin\u2019 hot little piece of gear. The TC Electronic Level Pilot is a high-resolution volume knob for your studio monitors. It sits inline between your monitors and your mixer or DAW to provide easy volume control wherever you need it. It does so with a level of luxury and precision that must be felt up, err\u2026 felt, to understand. The review of a volume knob may seem trivial, but this is a product you didn\u2019t know you needed until you put it on your desk. In the MusicPlayers.com studio, a computer keyboard sits front and center on the desk these days, and a Mackie mixing board (relegated to basic input/output/patching activity these days) is off to the side, beyond arms length reach\u2026 and that is where we used to have to reach to raise or lower the volume for our studio monitors. With the Level Pilot, we now have a rugged, studio-quality volume knob anywhere we want it \u2014 near the computer keyboard, on top of a MIDI keyboard controller, and so on. It\u2019s a solid knob, about 1.5 inches in diameter, brushed aluminum, with a silky-smooth action that lets you adjust volume with extreme precision whether using your entire hand or just your fingertips (like scrubbing video in a production suite). The Level Pilot is weighted and has a rubberized base that holds it solidly in place on your desktop. Placing anything in-line in your audio path seems like a scary proposition, but if done properly, you won\u2019t diminish the quality of your output in any way. And that \u201cproperly\u201d comment means that you\u2019ll want to invest in some good cables if you decide to add this knob to your studio and you\u2019re as anal about audio quality as we are. The Level Pilot has a hard-wired length of cable attached that runs from your desk a few feet and then fans out to a pair each of male and female XLR connectors. The design is completely passive, and balanced or unbalanced use is supported. We purchased two pair of short Monster Studio-Link balanced cables to interface the Level Pilot with our studio monitors and the mixing board. The results are transparent from an audio perspective, and the Level Pilot makes adjusting volume in your studio extremely convenient. With a street price under $80 (MSRP is $119), this is a great studio addition, and a great gift for the studio lover in your life (even if that lover is yourself). So head down to your favorite retailer and ask if you can play with their knobs. We dare you. TC Electronic"

      "value": "Whether you play live gigs or studio sessions, you almost always need to bring two guitars to a gig. In a typical set, there\u2019s no time for string changes if you break one \u2014 you need to be able to grab another instrument and keep on rockin\u2019. This necessitates bringing two instruments along, which is usually a cumbersome affair since you\u2019re likely dealing with two guitar cases. And the problem is only confounded if you\u2019re traveling to the gig on an airplane, where only a single gig bag will make it onto the aircraft with you. Bass players have less to worry about in the live setting regarding string breakage, but studio players may certainly want to bring a few different instruments to a recording session. We\u2019ve been waiting for something like the Mono M80 Dual case for years, and this superbly engineered gig bag delivers the holy grail of guitar and bass transportation: it transports two instruments securely in a single case, is lightweight and structural rigid, is weatherproof, and it conveniently holds plenty of extras in multiple pockets. We examined the Electric case and fell in love within a matter of minutes. With sleek looks that remind us of gear for protecting photographic equipment, the waterproof outer shell has weatherproofed zippers, and ABS rubber panels around the bottom and headstock areas add to the structural rigidity. Internally, each guitar has its own compartment, accessed by unzipping either the left or right side of the case. Inside each compartment, the instruments are secured in a very plush environment, held securely in place by a padded neck brace with a strap that runs across the fretboard. The case has room around the headstock so that your tuning pegs don\u2019t brush against the case, and foam bumpers in the bottom of the case are split in the middle to allow room for your strap pin. With this design the guitar\u2019s bottom rests directly against the padding, so if you drop the case hard on its ass, your guitar doesn\u2019t crash down on the strap pin, and the foam captures the impact instead of your instrument(s). It\u2019s a subtle detail, but a very nice one. Storage is abundant in the M80 Dual case. The external storage compartment has a Velcro hook to attach an instrument cable (for the anal retentive gear junkie, obviously, who doesn\u2019t want the strap to just flop around loose in the compartment like in other bags), and it has room for miscellaneous stuff like your tuner, headphones, bag of earplugs for your friends, etc. There is also a shallow zipper compartment at the headstock \u2014 useful for storing things like pens (for autographs and groupie phone numbers), cell phone, your wallet, etc. It has separate holders for these types of things inside. And the Velcro cover that secures your instrument neck to the padded neck brace has a clear zipper compartment for stashing picks. The case even has space to stash the dual shoulder straps in case you just want to carry it by one of its handles (top or side). We loaded the case with a few guitars: our very heavy Ibanez RG-series guitar with a mahogany body and a Music Man JP6. It was very easy to transport our guitars, and so convenient! Carrying guitars in two hard cases would be far more inconvenient, and the case is so well padded and protected that we wouldn\u2019t worry about the occasional tumble at a gig if someone knocked it over. And thanks to the rigid bottom, it even stands upright when fully loaded! The dimensions of this case make it suited to guitars in the solid body family \u2014 don\u2019t expect to stuff your ES 335 into one of these (but you\u2019re OK with your Les Paul). Most rock and country guitar players should have no issues. The Dual Bass case is identical in its feature set, but is longer to accommodate that instrument\u2019s size difference. Mono also makes single instrument cases, and that range of products includes similar cases for acoustic guitars and semi-hollow instruments. We have other gig bags that provide far less protection for individual guitars than this bag provides to two, and while the bag isn\u2019t going to offer full hard case-like protection, the usefulness and cleverness of its design leaves us with no interest in using our hard cases for anything other than transportation by way of a shipping company and road crew. This is the case we\u2019ll be carrying on board aircraft and bringing to local gigs. It is exactly what we\u2019ve been waiting for, and with a street price under $300, it\u2019s the case you\u2019ve been waiting for, too. Bravo, Mono! Mono Hybrid Cases"

      "value": "When we took on the task of scrutinizing the full line of Nomad Factory plug-ins, we were eager to get our hands dirty. With so many studio tools available we felt like kids in a candy store, but there was one set of plug-ins that kept catching our eyes (and ears) \u2014 the Retrology - Motown EQ package. When we installed the plug-ins on our ProTools 8.0 LE system we were instantly impressed with the look, feel and sound of these EQs. This pair of plug-ins would be helpful to any engineer looking to expand their arsenal of useful EQs, and thanks to a free ten-day trial download from www.NomadFactory.com, you can find out for yourself. We found numerous applications for these EQs on everything from instruments to vocals. The Nomad Factory Retrology - Motown EQ package includes two retro EQs: the Retro Film-Tone and the Retro Music-Tone. Each plug-in sports a seven-band equalizer with preset frequencies and proportional Q ratios. Depending on how great of a boost/cut you need, a greater boost/cut translates into a narrower Q. Despite the impression from their names, both plug-ins work great with music applications, and from what we could tell the two EQs are differentiated only by their frequency bands. The Film-Tone has frequencies 80, 200, 500, 1250, 3200, 8000, and 16,000Hz while the Music-Tone addresses frequencies 50, 130, 320, 800, 2000, 5000, and 12,500Hz. You can use both of them in conjunction on a given track, effectively creating a 14-band. They are each packaged behind a very cool interface which is as pleasing visually as the EQs are pleasing sonically. An iLok (not included) is required to use these plug-ins. We found these EQs to be extremely user-friendly and quite helpful in expanding our approach to EQing recorded music. Both EQs come loaded up with presets that are well categorized, making it very easy to find a starting point for your audio (great if you haven\u2019t mixed many sessions with a vintage vibe). With the resurrection of the Motown sound in modern music through artists like Amy Winehouse and Raphael Saadiq we wanted to try to use these for what they are intended \u2014 put a little old-school feeling into our mixes. But where do we start? We weren\u2019t even born when Motown was thriving! Working mostly with hip-hop, rock, pop and generally modern music, we needed a little help deciding how they would have EQ\u2019ed the instruments back in the day. The presets had some very cool starting points and gave us some good mixing ideas. The seven big knobs in the vintage-styled interface were very simple to work with. Every control on the face of the EQ was easily automated within ProTools, which further helped make operation a breeze. Considering how useful these EQs are as a pair, we would love to see them incorporated into a single plug-in, perhaps one that gives you a user-selectable choice of each seven-band EQ, plus a third setting to use a \u201csuper\u201d fourteen-band EQ. The sonic qualities of the plug-ins were top notch, but they especially shined in the higher frequencies. This was very apparent when working with drums. When we applied the Retrology Music-Tone to our overheads we heard a new life and brightness from cymbals that were previously flat and dull simply by running through the preset options. With a few final adjustments and the addition of the Retrology Film-Tone's overlapping frequency bands to hone in on exactly what we wanted, we had a beautiful marriage of modern recording and classic sound. This was also the case with vocals and guitars that we ran through the plug-ins. Equally, the low end had some shining moments. To test this we ran our bass through the EQs. Despite being recorded with a flat EQ the introduction of these plug-ins gave us a thick, thumping low end. With a little low end removed and a boost to the low-mids, we again found ourselves with an authentic, retro-sounding instrument. There was no documentation supplied with these plug-ins, but technical support is provided via the Namd Factory website. These plug-ins can be downloaded directly from www.NomadFactory.com and installed pretty easily. We found the $149 price tag to be very reasonable, and as with most of the Nomad Factory products, it can be purchased as part of several bundles (which saves a ton more overall). Nomad Factory"

      "value": "Guitar players with rack gear are constantly swapping rack modules, preamps, and pedals in and out of their racks as they try to create just the right tone that defines their signature sound. And once the rack gear is figured out, the patch connections can easily turn into a spaghetti tangle of mismatched cords of various lengths, making it extremely difficult to troubleshoot rack issues in a hurry (especially on a dimly lit stage). Custom cable solutions are extremely popular with the rack crowd \u2014 not only do they result in better tone than tying up long cables, but they enable you to custom fit cables into your rack without any mess, making for a nice and tidy setup that is easy to troubleshoot and maintain. George L\u2019s has been making custom cable solutions for guitar players for over thirty-five years. Widely regarded for making some of the best sounding cables available, we decided to put their latest offering \u2014 the .155 Effects Kit, to the test. Armed with nothing more than some wire cutters and a small screwdriver, it was only a matter of minutes before we had replaced the cable mess behind one of our guitar racks with a beautiful custom solution that sounded fantastic. The .155 Effects Kit includes ten feet of cable (.155mm is the cable diameter), ten straight \u00bc\u201d plugs, ten right-angle plugs, and an assortment of colore d stress-relief jackets. Although available in multiple color choices, we opted for the slightly more expensive blue cable kit \u2014 not just because we love blue, but because this package features gold-plated connectors instead of the standard nickel-plated plugs (gold is the best sounding, commonly-used material for conducting electrical signals). Assembling cables was a straightforward affair, though not entirely easy until we got the hang of it. The process is as follows (for the straight plugs): cut the cable straight across, back out (loosen) the set screw in the plug far enough so that you can insert the cable into the end of the plug, push it firmly so that it makes contact at the end, and then tighten the set screw enough so that it breaks through the outer sheath of the cable and makes contact with the wires inside. The trick is twofold: pushing the cable in far enough to make contact with the tip, and then tightening the set screw enough to make contact with the sleeve. The instructions suggest turning the screw between one and two rotations, but we found that we had to tighten it significantly more to break through the heavy-duty sheath. A cable tester is useful for checking your cables, and we had to reassemble some of our cables a number of times until we got the hang of it. Assembling the right-angle connectors was an easier affair, and no screwdriver was necessary. We just inserted the cable, bent the cable to exit the plug from the side, and then just tightened a thumbscrew at the rear of the plug to make the wire connection. Color-coded stress-relief covers were provided. On the straight plugs, remember to slide the covers onto the cut wire , before you attach the jacks, or else you\u2019ll be reassembling that cable, too! (Yes, every hard lesson to learn was, in fact, learned the hard way while rewiring our rack.) The right-angle covers slide on after you\u2019ve assembled the cables. The end result? The cables sound great, and our rack is significantly more impressive when we look at it from the rear (not to mention easier to figure out the signal paths visually). We still have to replace a few cables with additional parts \u2014 ten straight- and right-angle plugs may not work best depending on your particular rack situation, and in our case we could use a few more straight connectors. Reviewing the audio quality of cables in a scientific manner is a challenging process to say the least, and it\u2019s impossible to accurately pick one wire as sounding truly than the next. But suffice to say that premium quality cables in general (like these) sound significantly better than cheap store-brand cables. Our George L\u2019s sounded quiet and full-spectrum with regard to our tone \u2014 just what our thousands of dollars worth of rack gear and tube amps demanded. Our rack couldn\u2019t be happier. The .155 Effects Kit with gold plugs sells direct from the George L\u2019s website for $114, or the standard kit can be purchased for only $99. You can also purchase an assortment of cables and connectors a la carte, including some pre-manufactured instrument cables featuring George L\u2019s premium cables and connectors.

      "value": "Many 2x12 and 4x12 speaker cabinets are wired for monaural operation, but if you're one of the many guitar players with a stereo rig, this sometimes limits your options when you only want to bring a single cabinet to the gig. Romanian manufacturer BECOS has created fantastic replacement jack plates that converts your beloved 2x12 or 4x12 cabinet from mono-only to stereo-or-mono operation at the flip of a switch! These jack plates were specifically engineered to match the physical dimensions of the jack plates that come in Mesa/Boogie Rectifier and Roadster series cabinets, and we installed one of these plates into a 2x12 Rectifier Horizontal cabinet perfectly in less than ten minutes, most of which was spent just locating our screwdriver and wire cutters. Speaker jack plates tend to be somewhat universal in their dimensions, so there\u2019s certainly a chance that these plates should install easily into other manufacturers speaker cabinets without the need for any modifications (like cutting out the opening on the rear of the cabinet to accommodate a different-sized plate). The dimensions of the plate are 112 mm x 102 mm (also, we\u2019ve included a diagram at the end of this review containing all the measurements you\u2019ll need if you are a cabinet builder).\u00a0 Note that theses jack plates were designed for use with cabinets that have either two 16-ohm, 60-Watt speakers or four 8-ohm, 60-Watt speakers. The BECOS jack plates are precision manufactured using premium components. There are \u00bc\u201d TRS Neutrik connectors for the input and outputs, and a heavy-duty metal switch for selecting between Mono or Stereo operation. Installation couldn\u2019t be any easier \u2013 no soldering required! First, we unscrewed the Mesa/Boogie jack plate from the rear of our Rectifier cabinet. Making note of which wires were the positive and negative leads from each speaker, we cut the wires near the soldered end at the jack plate to remove it and then spliced approximately \u00bc\u201d of the sheath to expose some bare wire. The BECOS plate uses thoughtfully designed screw post terminals to attach the speaker wires. We just slid the exposed end of the speaker wires into the corresponding (labeled) terminals, tightened the set screws with a small screwdriver, and then attached the plate to the back of our speaker cabinet. The fit was truly identical to Mesa/Boogie\u2019s jack plate. Although we didn\u2019t install it, we also examined the 4x12 jack plate (our Rectifier 4x12 cabinet was wired for Mono or Stereo operation from the factory). This jack plate is nearly identical to the 2x12 plate, but features twice as many speaker contacts. Additionally, BECOS is preparing an alternate version of the 2x12 jack plate that includes a speaker output jack to daisy chain an additional cabinet. A few other nice touches: BECOS label the jacks with proper Ohm ratings based on Mono or Stereo use, and they provide space on a scribble strip on the plate to record your speaker cabinet\u2019s serial number (since it was etched onto the Mesa/Boogie plate that we removed). Operationally, the switch worked perfectly! There was no difference in tone whatsoever from the installation of this jack plate, and we now gained the ability to run our 2x12 cabinet in stereo with various stereo guitar rigs of ours. If you play a stereo setup, and especially if you play Mesa/Boogie Rectifier cabinets, this product is a no-brainer. And of course if you\u2019re building your own custom speaker cabinet, you won\u2019t go wrong with the BECOS jack plate. Priced at only 29,75 Euros (approximately $40.00 USD), and 34,50 Euros ($45) for the 4x12 jack plate, this simple upgrade is easily worth the small investment."

      "value": "Every so often you hear about innovative new products that will change the way you think about the norm, and the Drumnetics Pedal is no exception. When we first heard about the Drumnetics Pedal, we were interested to learn about its completely different approach to function. At the risk of sounding like a physics professor, what\u2019s revolutionary about this pedal is the replacement of the traditional spring apparatus with powerful magnets that generate the source of kinetic function. More importantly, the Drumnetics Pedal accomplishes this feat while creating a smooth, natural pedal feel that is extremely dynamic, completely silent, and can be used for any musical application. The meticulously engineered, aluminum-constructed Drumnetics Pedal contains features you won\u2019t find on any other drum pedal. For starters, this is the only pedal we know of that uses a repulsive magnetic field as the basis for pedal tension and rebound. Two powerful magnets are encased in cartridges and positioned along the centerline of the pedal. One magnet is located under the middle section of the pedal board along a track; the other is mounted to the base board at a slight angle parallel to the pedal board. Both magnets can be adjusted to increase (or decrease) the repulsive force in the pedal\u2019s overall action. One particular advantage of this design (with magnets along the centerline of the pedal) over conventional springs is that it provides for a direct transfer of energy that is otherwise reduced (to varying degrees) by a traditional spring design. Unlike more traditional pedals that use chains or nylon straps, the Drumnetics Pedal uses an adjustable linkage to connect the pedal board to the rotor cam. Set in the center section of the rotor cam is the housing block used to mount the beater shaft. By adjusting the housing block via a set bolt, you can adjust the angle of the beater shaft. The housing block is also drilled out with a few thousands inch variance to accommodate different sized shafts from other manufacturers. The Drumnetics Pedal includes a medium-size rubber beater that is manufactured by SuperBeaters. At first glance the Drumnetics Pedal looks like any other pedal \u2013 but something seems to be missing. That\u2019s right\u2026 springs! Those archaic coil contraptions that protrude from the sides of the more traditional pedals are gone. The days of noisy, cumbersome springs are finally over. Welcome to the wonderful world of magnets! Without making any adjustments to the pedal or pondering on the complex physics behind the pedals magnetic forces, we simply attached the pedal to our bass drum and started playing. This pedal has the same sensation of spring tension and rebound that we\u2019re used to with traditional pedals. How did they do it? Drumnetics replicated the function of traditional spring-based pedals in a non-traditional manner. In order to understand how this pedal works we decided to take a step back and consult the literature that came with the pedal and this is what we learned: The patented Drumnetics Pedal offers four conjunctive adjustment settings. Out of the box we found the default magnetic force to be too strong for our tastes. In other words, it took too much force to depress the pedal board down for the beater to reach the drum head. When we examined the positioning of the magnets for both the pedal board and base, the magnets were spaced directly on top of each other. This turns out to be the position that generates the largest level of repulsive force between the magnets, and thus, the greatest amount of resistance for the pedal board. Understanding how these magnetic forces work is the most important aspect for attaining the correct feel of the pedal. We adjusted both the top and bottom magnet cartridges to their furthest positions away from each other. This involved moving the top magnet to the furthest position back on the pedal board toward the heel while moving the bottom magnet as far forward as possible. The result was the loosest possible feel for the pedal board, almost as if there was no magnetic force. Next, we gradually moved the top magnet forward in very small increments. Each time the magnet was moved we played the pedal for a few minutes to see how the change felt. Eventually we found a setting that provided just the right amount of resistance. Another adjustment made was with the pedal board height. By default the pedal board was a bit high for us and by loosening the two small hex screws on the linkage we were able to lower the pedal board to a position that felt comfortable. While we were at it, we also made some small adjustments to the beater shaft and housing block [ ]. The Drumnetics Pedal ships with a rubber beater made by SuperBeaters. Although this rubber beater provided a decent feel we opted to swap out the supplied beater with our own felt beater. The beater shaft adjustment is made using a standard drum key and the housing block accepted our alternative beater shaft without any hassles. Setting the beater angle was very simple. Using one of the supplied hex wrenches we loosened the set bolt in the cam assembly and moved the center-shaft housing block to the position and angle that felt best for us. It\u2019s possible for the two magnets to touch as you play. We didn\u2019t find this to be an issue, but speculate that if you set the pedal board to the lowest position and set the beater angle as far back as possible, the greater travel distance for the beater would result in the magnets touching at the bottom of the down stroke. The adjustment guideline documentation supplied with the pedal addresses this with suggested base plate and beater angle settings. On a side note, the two hex wrenches used for adjusting the pedal slide nicely into two conveniently located slots in the base of the pedal. Since these slots are located underneath the bottom magnet, the magnet\u2019s attractive force pulls the wrenches into place. Did we mention these magnets are strong? Make sure to keep any metal objects with iron, like drum keys, away from the magnets on the pedal or you find they\u2019ll fly towards the magnets. The feel of this pedal is amazing. The down and up stroke of the pedal board is extremely smooth with virtually no friction at any of the contact points. Unlike other pedals where the beater bounces forward and back repeatedly after the pedal is released, the Drumnetics Pedal returns to its original position in a very precise manner allowing for greater control. It\u2019s clear that Drumnetics set out to create the most technically advanced and dynamic pedal on the market. This pedal is second to none. Ordinarily, the review of a kick pedal wouldn\u2019t include a Sound section, but we have to comment on what you won\u2019t hear with the Drumnetics Pedal. An amazing quality of the Drumnetics Pedal is how stealthily quiet it is! The use of magnets results in the reduction of moving parts that are typically the culprit for pedal noise. In addition, the pedal board has self-lubricating brass bushings impregnated with oil on both sides to further reduce friction. Studio engineers would do well to keep one of these pedals handy for drummers who come in with old, beat-up kits that feature \u201csqueaky\u201d pedals. There is a single sheet of documentation included with the pedal that covers all the features and adjustment options. We found this lightweight documentation sufficient as the pedal layout is intuitive and easy to use. The website also has some helpful information and pictures that explain each of the pedals features. The Drumnetics Pedal costs $300, plus $15 for shipping and handling, and is currently sold directly through the company\u2019s website. This is a bit pricey for a single pedal, but then again, no other manufacturer offers a pedal as advanced as this. When asked about future product development plans, Michael Van Dyk, founder of Drumnetics, stated that both double-pedal and hi-hat prototypes are in the works. A prototype of the double-pedal might even be ready for the Winter NAMM show in January 2008 \u2014 we can\u2019t wait to check out. Drumnetics www.drumnetics.com"

      "value": "Typically, we\u2019re very hesitant to apply cleaners and polishes to our expensive guitars \u2013 it would be quite upsetting to inadvertently destroy the finish on a beautiful instrument. We don\u2019t care for spray products because it\u2019s easy to inadvertently get the spray on components you\u2019d otherwise not wish to clean, and paste/wax-related products can leave a residue if you\u2019re not careful in their application. Thankfully, Ernie Ball came to the rescue with Wonder Wipes \u2013 a line of guitar cleaning products that are applied as easily as taking a pre-moistened baby wipe from the dispenser and applying it to your infant\u2019s bottom. [Editor\u2019s Note: We strongly discourage the use of baby wipes on musical instruments, and we further discourage the use of Wonder Wipes on your youngest family member.] The three products in the collection are Instrument Polish, for removing smudges and grime from your guitar/bass body; Fretboard Conditioner, for cleaning your instrument fretboard and neck; and String Cleaner, for wiping down your strings to remove sweat, thus extending the life of your strings. We figured that if the folks at Ernie Ball are willing to use these cleaning products on Music Man guitars, then we shouldn\u2019t have any reason to worry about using the wipes on our instruments (many of which are Music Man guitars and basses). All products come in plastic bins that are designed for you to pull wipes from the top of the canister. We found that with a new, large-sized container of forty wipes, it was a bit tough pulling the first few wipes from the container without popping the lid. Our favorite of the bunch might be the Instrument Polish. It worked great for removing grime, smudges, and fingerprints from the glossy finishes on our guitars \u2013 better than a damp rag, and much less fuss than with typical polishing agents applied to a cloth. We found that it was quite easy to clean two guitar bodies with a single wipe, too! We also used the wipes on a guitar with a flat finish (an Ibanez RG-series model) and though it required a little more \u201celbow grease,\u201d the wipes worked just as well on this finish, and in all cases, never left any sort of residue behind. N ext up was the Fretboard Conditioner. Featuring a \u201cunique blend of orange, jojoba, and linseed oils,\u201d not only did this product do a beautiful job of cleaning and restoring our maple and rosewood fingerboards, and the natural finishes on our hand-oiled/non-gloss guitar necks, but at least one staffer contemplated the product\u2019s use as a natural insect repellent when applied to their body. We don\u2019t have any official test results for that application! As its intended purpose is to really clean your fretboard, you\u2019ll have a much better experience with these wipes after removing the strings from your instrument. If you have a floating tremolo system, be sure to block it first before removing all of your strings or you\u2019ll spend hours wrestling your guitar back in tune. In all seriousness, though, follow the instructions, simple as they are. The Fretboard Cleaner gets applied, then sets for a few minutes, and then you\u2019ll most likely need to wipe off the excess with a dry cloth (as we did). We might suggest purchasing the smaller sized package of this cleaner since cleaning your neck probably doesn\u2019t need to happen more than once or twice per year, and the product might dry up in that amount of time. Or\u2026 buy the large pack and share it with your friends! The String Cleaner, last but not least, is great for wiping down your strings after a gig, rehearsal, or extended jam. Typically, we\u2019ve used a rag, but over time, the rag gets pretty nasty looking (and less effective) until washed. We liked using the string cleaner: simply wipe off your strings and discard, but as we\u2019re not significantly sweaty shredders, we don\u2019t know for sure if these will extend the life of our strings any better than a regular cloth. If you\u2019re in the habit of doing nothing after playing, though, then it\u2019s a certainty that these wipes will indeed work wonders. Priced at $15.99 (MSRP) for the large forty-wipe containers and only $8.99 for twenty-five smaller wipes (in a smaller container that can fit in your guitar case or gig bag), these can be purchased at a discount from numerous retailers. It\u2019s a small price to pay for simple cleaning products that work great with little fuss. Ernie Ball"

      "value": "If you like to use effect pedals, most likely you\u2019ve made use of a pedalboard to hold your pedals. Many players build their own pedalboards from plywood, and numerous options are available for sale from various accessory product manufacturers. Many pro-level players we know have been using the Pedaltrain series of pedalboards from Pro Stage Gear, and after spending time with the large Pedaltrain Pro, we understand why these are the pedalboards for serious pedal setups. Made from lightweight (but strong) aluminum, the 32\u201d x 16\u201d x 3\u201d Pedaltrain Pro is significantly lighter in weight than an equivalent plywood pedalboard \u2013 only seven pounds before you load it up with music gear. The Pedaltrain Pro/SC that we tested comes with a lightweight and attractive soft case, while the more-costly Pro/HC comes with a hard case. The latter adds a hefty thirty-two pounds to the overall package, but the case has built-in wheels and a handle \u2013 perfect for the heavily gigging or touring musician. There is much that we loved about the Pedaltrain Pro. After attaching the included two-inch wide strips of Velcro to the rails of the Pedaltrain (and cutting Velcro strips for the bottom of our pedals), it was a simple matter of deciding where to place our assortment of pedals on the large pedalboard. Because there are large gaps between each of the four rows on the Pedaltrain, it was very easy to route power cords and connecting cables underneath the pedalboard, keeping our setup nice and tidy. Pro Stage Gear also includes a bundle of zip ties with the product, so securing our cables was further simplified. The angle of the pedalboard is handy for more than just easy stomping. With a few careful cuts to remove part of the aluminum bracing underneath (fully described on the Pedaltrain.com website at ), a power supply such as the popular can be mounted underneath so that it doesn\u2019t take up any room on the pedalboard. The Pedaltrain Pro/SC (MSRP $259.95) sells for $150 \u2013 a good price for such a nice pedalboard that includes a carrying case. For the less handy among you, Pro Stage Gear will perform the under-mounting power supply surgery \u2013 just ship them your pedalboard, power supply, and $50. Really, there\u2019s nothing not to love about the Pedaltrain Pro. And for those of you who don\u2019t need a pedalboard this large, Pro Stage Gear also makes two other Pedaltrains in smaller sizes.

      "value": "IK Multimedia\u2019s extremely inexpensive StealthPlug provides the absolute simplest way to connect your electric guitar to a computer. With the included copy of AmpliTube 2 Live, we were up and running within a matter of minutes on the Apple Power Macintosh G5 in our home office while other family members remained completely unaware that we were \u201crocking out\u201d at extremely quiet volume levels. The StealthPlug is a guitar and bass instrument cable with a USB connector at one end, a \u00bc\u201d instrument connector at the other end, and a small plastic control unit wired closer to the instrument end of the cable. The control unit has a headphone jack and volume controls. It\u2019s basically just a simplified tool for easy at-home practicing and for laying down your demo ideas while everyone else in the house is sleeping. Of course the more adventurous among you might consider taking a laptop and a StealthPlug to a gig \u2013 it certainly weighs less than bringing an amplifier, and it would also be useful to bring along to a song-writing session where you are less concerned with your tone but still want to have a variety of sounds and effects at your disposal. This is not a pro-quality product, so don\u2019t expect the same kind of results as you\u2019d get from using dedicated audio hardware in your studio. The somewhat thin instrument cable has molded connectors that could be easily broken if you attempted to use it in a live band situation. We\u2019re surprised that IK Multimedia didn\u2019t just put a \u00bc\u201d female connector at the instrument end so that you could use higher-quality audio cables of your own choosing, but that probably would have increased the cost of manufacturing. One of the StealthPlug\u2019s many nice attributes is its extremely low price. The included copy of AmpliTube 2 Live is scaled down compared to the full-blown Amplitube 2 that we have previously reviewed ( ). This light version of AmpliTube 2 has fewer amp models (only a British and American amp, and one bass amp) and speaker models, fewer controls, and fewer effects, but functions in a nearly-identical manner. Those of you familiar with the full product will be immediately at home with AmpliTube 2 Live, though. In use, the StealthPlug was a little noisy with both a DiMarzio humbucker-equipped Music Man guitar and a Fender Strat with Vintage Noiseless pickups. This wasn\u2019t an issue at all for our practice purposes \u2013 just not a good choice for \u201cserious\u201d recording. One feature of AmpliTube 2 Live that we absolutely loved in the stand-alone version of the software (it also runs as a plug-in in RTAS and VST environments) was the SpeedTrainer feature. This enabled us to easily load MP3s (or other audio files such as .WAV, .AIF, and .WMA) directly from our iTunes Music Library to practice along with. Not only could we adjust the volume/mix in relation to our guitar, we could also adjust tempo without altering pitch. This worked extremely well for helping us to relearn some of our own solos from various recordings with our band. Those of you who are more cover-tune minded will find the feature especially handy. You can also adjust the pitch to transpose the key of songs. One minor gripe with AmpliTube 2 Live was that every time we loaded one of the preset sounds, our Input and Master Level controls reset themselves (because they are saved with each individual preset), so we couldn\u2019t quickly flip through various sounds without having to adjust levels. Fortunately, though, when we saved new sounds (or edited existing presets), the levels we needed were saved with them, so once you dial in your personal sounds, the levels will stay properly adjusted. There is a volume control on the StealthPlug, but it controlled our Macintosh system volume. It would have made more sense (to us) for it to adjust the AmpiTube 2 Master Output volume, or even better: a preference setting that would have let us choose which volume control was affected by the buttons on the StealthPlug. Performance was excellent. Once we adjusted the buffer size, latency was barely detectable. Only the fastest of shredders might find reason to complain, but we, on the other hand were quite satisfied. A folder on the installation disk includes 500 MB worth of grooves to jam with from Sonic Reality. We had a lot of fun jamming along with them. An additional CD is bundled with some other software products such as Traction 2.1, SampleTank 2 SE, and a T-RackS EQ plug-in, but we didn\u2019t test any of these \u201cextras.\u201d Despite any shortcomings from a professional\u2019s perspective, at only $99 street (MSRP is $129), we\u2019re quite happy with the package. We can take our laptop and guitar on weekend getaways, play quietly at home without our amp, and find a variety of uses for it where we don\u2019t need the quality of our high-end amps and outboard effects.

      "value": "If you\u2019re like us, a pedal board with lots of loose cables running every which way is completely unacceptable. Likewise, a tangle of wires from your keyboards to a mixer is just as unsightly. While there are some dedicated snake systems for managing audio, those prevent you from utilizing your favorite premium cables. What\u2019s a neat freak to do? We tried a few other general-purpose solutions \u2013 Ikea sells some conduit for organizing your television/stereo cables, and our local Home Depot had conduit for organizing electrical wires. But running twenty-foot cable runs with four or more cables into those long conduits took a long time, and the twenty-minute ordeal left our fingers raw. Further, removing individual cables messed the whole system up, and where you need the cables to flex, the general-purpose solutions we tried would buckle and come apart slightly. We even resorted to tying bunches of cables together with plastic cable ties, but if you ever coil up your cables to pack for a gig, you\u2019ve felt the pain of those sharp plastic edges where you cut the excess tie length away, and of course changing a cable requires cutting all the wraps off and starting over again. Enter AudioSkin \u2013 an ingenious cable management system that works great for your pedal board, rack, and yes, even your home theater. Unlike the cable solutions above, using the AudioSkin system, we were able to zip up six audio cables plus one power cord from our pedal board to our amp and effects rack in less than twenty seconds! Further, the interlocking weave of the AudioSkin cable organizer gives it plenty of room to flex without buckling, and you can pull individual cables out part-way while leaving the other cables wrapped up. This was useful on our pedal board where most of the cables ran to one side of the board, but one or two cables needed to be routed to the other side of our setup. AudioSkin is one of those clever, inexpensive ($17 from the Audioskin web site) products that will make your life easier, the grass a little bit greener, and your cable management a heck of a lot easier. Check out the demo video on their home page \u2013 this system absolutely works as simply as they demonstrate. AudioSkin"

      "value": "A dead amplifier or electronic instrument is useless, so making sure it receives a constant supply of clean power is the simplest way to protect your investment \u2014 especially if you gig in locations where you can\u2019t be assured of isolated, regulated, or even grounded, three-pole power. There\u2019s nothing especially glamorous about power conditioners, but you need to invest in them. As with previous generations of Furman products, the recently updated models of Furman PL-series power conditioners are sure to keep your gear in top form. You\u2019re not running your gear into a cheap power strip, are you? The first thing to realize is that surge protection is just one small part of what power conditioners like the PL series provide. Equally important, if not more-so, the PL-series devices provide noise filtration to ensure that clean power reaches your amp, which translates into less electrical noise. This can make a big difference in the quality of audio you hear coming \u2014 especially for guitar players using tube amplifiers. We spent some time with one power conditioner from the Plus series, and one from the Pro series. The principle difference between the product lines is that the Pro series features a 20 amp rating for use with big power, while the Plus series has a 15 amp rating. The PL-Plus C and PL-Pro C models have a series of colored LEDs that show incoming voltage levels, while the PL-PLUS DMC and PL-PRO DMC models have a numeric display that provides exact readings of the incoming voltage. Furman\u2019s Extreme Voltage Shutdown (EVS) feature shuts your equipment Off in the event of extreme voltage being sent to the device, such as if it were accidentally connected to an outlet running at a much higher voltage (handy if you\u2019re on an international tour and your tech plugs your gear into the wrong outlet). If you haven\u2019t upgraded from your old, first generation PL-series power conditioner, the first thing you\u2019ll notice is the weight \u2014 these things are heavy! If you were hoping to keep rack weight to a minimum, you\u2019ll probably be upset by the fact that these weigh twelve pounds apiece (significantly more than the first generation products, but similar to the Series II products on the market since 2001)! The PL-series power conditioners each have eight outlets on the rear split into two isolated blocks. While the first bank of five outlets is pretty typical, the second bank (of three outlets) has additional spacing between the outlets in order to accommodate wall warts. One especially cool feature of the Pro units is that they also include special securing loops with straps that let you physically secure your wall warts to the back of the power conditioner \u2014 a fantastic feature if you ever end up placing your rack gear on its back or side (like sticking it in a car for transportation to a gig). We think this handy feature should appear on all units in both product lines. Both models featured retractable LED lights with dimmer switches on the front, and BNC connectors on the rear for standard goose-neck lamps. They also provided an additional outlet on the face \u2014 handy when you have some random device you need to plug in that isn\u2019t part of your rack (like the rechargeable batteries for your wireless systems). But the Pro series added another cool feature \u2014 a front-mounted USB power socket for charging your portable electronic devices! We found this great for charging up iPods and Blackberry mobile devices during band rehearsals. Both units worked great, and both the multi-segment LED voltmeter and digital meter (on the DMC model) provided useful and accurate monitoring of our power levels. Even in a studio with new wiring, the line coming into our building from the pole is beyond our control, and it was interesting to observe the subtle fluctuations in power that we had in our studio. We loved the cool blue light of the digital meter, too. It should also be noted that the pullout lights didn\u2019t generate any appreciable heat. If you plan to plug a Pro-series unit into a typical 15-amp outlet, keep in mind that you\u2019ll need an adapter from a hardware store. The power cord is designed to plug into a 20-amp outlet with the neutral perpendicular to the hot (i.e. a rotated prong similar in appearance to certain household appliances). The other features are identical. Contact Information Furman Sound"

For the first time in years, we\u2019re not afraid to wear belts or button-down shirts while playing our expensive custom shop guitars for fear of scratching the back of our prized instruments. We\u2019ve seen other protectors with elastic straps that wrap around your guitar \u2013 not our guitars of course, because those protectors are horrifically ugly, plus they don\u2019t stay in place very well. The Scratch Pad has a soft velveteen surface on one side, available in black, red, blue, and brown. It feels great and looks nice. The other side is a copolymer gel-like material that is made up of thousands of microscopic suction cups. After peeling the Scratch Pad off its protective storage sheet, you just place it where you want on the back of your guitar. It sticks beautifully, and through numerous repeat applications on a few different guitars over the past month, it\u2019s still working as good as new for us. If you have a uniquely shaped instrument, the Scratch Pad is thin enough that you can easily trim it to size for a custom fit. When not in use, Scratch Pad LLC recommends storing the Scratch Pad on its storage sheet to keep the copolymer surface clean. This worked fine for us, and presumably leads you to wonder why you\u2019d even take it off your guitar. The copolymer is compatible with acrylic guitar finishes, but if your guitar has a nitrocellulose finish, it\u2019s not recommended that anything be left touching the surface for prolonged periods of time. If you can\u2019t find out from the manufacturer of your guitar whether its finish is acrylic or nitrocellulose (most are of the safe acrylic variety), you can err on the side of caution and just remove the scratch pad after playing. For only $26.95 MSRP (but typically selling for only $20), we think this is an essential accessory for anyone who cares about protecting their guitar\u2019s rear finish from scratches.

      "value": "No matter how technology progresses with effects, amp modeling, and signal processing, one simple fact remains constant: you have to connect your guitars to your amps! Wireless systems have been around for some time, and Audio-Technica\u2019s 3000 Series wireless system is a solid performer that maintains a very good balance of features, ease of use, and price. Sonically, this is a good system, though it isn\u2019t as refined as other products in its class. We were very happy using it since the audio quality was good, and it was fairly easy to troubleshoot the few times we needed to. However, there were a few elements we wished were different, most notably the poorly-designed power supply. While there are some easy workarounds for the few issues we had, they limit this unit from being the ultimate plug-and-play wireless system. The 3000 Series is a 200-channel UHF wireless system designed for a wide range of applications. We tested the ATW-R3100 receiver and ATW-T310 UniPak\u2122 transmitter. The 3000 Series systems and components are available in two UHF frequency bands: 541.5 to 566.375 MHz (TV channels 25 to 30) and 655.5 to 680.375 MHz (TV channels 44 to 49), with 200 selectable frequencies in each band. Soft-touch controls offer quick, easy access to functions during setup and operation. The receiver features two independent antennas, offering true diversity operation and automatic frequency scanning. Audio-Technica claims a usage range of about 300 feet. Both the transmitter and receiver have LCD displays that are easy to read. However, unlike the receiver, the transmitter does not have a backlit screen \u2013 likely to preserve battery life. The transmitter runs on two AA batteries (not included). Both the transmitter and receiver display the frequency being sent and received at all times, so it is easy to check if the pair are \u201cseeing\u201d each other. Frequency matching can be accomplished either manually (setting both transmitter and receiver to the same frequency by hand) or semi-automatically (the receiver scans via a menu command to find an unused frequency, then you manually set the transmitter to match it). The receiver sports both unbalanced and balanced outputs (XLR and \u00bc\u201d), allowing for flexibility in signal routing. The receiver shows the transmitter\u2019s battery life at all times (in addition to the transmitter), which is a very nice touch since it\u2019s easier to glance at your rack than at the transmitter attached to your guitar strap during a performance. Although the included rack ears made installation into our guitar rig easy, there was no provision for moving the antennas from the rear of the receiver to the front of our rack, common with other products in its class. If your wireless system is placed beneath deep equipment in a rack, you may have difficulty aligning the antennas upward in a 45-degree angle (as recommended by Audio-Technica), and having the antennas hidden behind your rack could cut down on the system\u2019s usable range. An optional kit is available for relocating the antennas to the front of your rack, something you\u2019ll need to purchase when placing this system into a guitar rack. Further, the ATW-T310 UniPak transmitter does not include the special instrument cable necessary to connect your guitar to the transmitter. Be sure to review our price section to make sure you order all the parts necessary to get up and running with this system. There were some minor but surprising items that arose with this system. Though we were evaluating the instrument version of this product, unbeknownst to us, the receiver\u2019s default setting was for receiving a microphone signal. As a result, our system (using a guitar) did not produce any sound when we hooked it up. After checking everything a few times, and making sure the frequencies were correct, we finally discovered in the User\u2019s Guide that the default settings were for a microphone signal and needed to be changed for instrument use. We think a bright-colored \u201cRead This First\u201d paper notice would be useful to include with the packaging of the transmitter so that musicians will know immediately that an adjustment to the factory defaults is necessity (of course, MusicPlayers.com readers shouldn\u2019t have any problems since you\u2019re now aware of this minor-but-crucial detail). Settings on the UniPak transmitter were navigated by a series of simple menus, which include Input Selection (microphone/lo-impedance or instrument/high-impedance), RF Power (to boost the signal, though it means shorter battery life), Audio Input Level (to choose between -6 dB or other levels), and Frequency. We found the meter hold function particularly interesting: when set to On, the receiver displayed the highest and lowest audio signal levels received as bars on the LCD display, useful for initial system configuration or troubleshooting. We used the ATW-3110a system in two settings. The first was with a five-piece band utilizing two other wireless systems from other manufacturers. Our Audio-Technica 3000 system worked very well with no problems. Dropouts did not occur, and there was no interference to or from other systems. Changing frequencies on this system was easy, but requires some manual intervention. The automated search capability in the receiver has a few methods of discovering available frequencies. We found the \u201cwrap-around\u201d setting yielded fastest results for locating open frequencies. Once the receiver locked into an open frequency, though, we had to manually select the matching frequency in the transmitter. Our biggest complaint has to do with the horrible power supply. Rather than an internal power supply, or even a typical wall wart, the Audio-Technica system uses a \u201cmiddle of the cord\u201d wall wart. While this may be suffice if you are placing the unit on top of a guitar amp, it is not acceptable to have a loose wall wart rolling around in the back of your equipment rack. Tape or Velcro will provide a simple fix inside your rack, but a better-designed power supply should have been implemented. The ATW-3110a system sounded very good. The system was quiet and did not produce any distortion or noise in our guitar signal. The sound was almost as good (or as bad) as our playing! If you\u2019re just stepping up from an older and less expensive system, you shouldn\u2019t be disappointed. The frequency response is rated at 70 Hz \u2013 15 kHz. Your guitar\u2019s normal frequency response falls slightly below 70 Hz, and we found the wireless guitar tone to sound slightly compressed compared to our wired tone. Tests using a single-coil Fender standard strat and a Schecter guitar with Duncan Design humbuckers and a piezzo bridge revealed that sonically, our wireless sound was full and rich, but the wireless sound was slightly brighter than our wired sound, apparently getting a mid-high EQ boost with a slight roll-off of the lowest bass string frequencies. While you can compensate for this with slight adjustment to the EQ on your amp, if you routinely switch back-and-forth between wired and wireless (during rehearsals vs. live on stage), this could become a minor annoyance. The bass roll-off combined with the very slight compression resulted in less overall richness or depth of tone, but it was only apparent when strumming acoustic passages using the piezzo pickup in our Schecter or playing other clean rhythms on the guitars. For our distorted sounds, the Audio-Technica system sounded great. In a live setting, your fans should not be able to detect this subtle difference in your acoustic tones. Overall, Audio-Technica did a good job of explaining features and how they work. Unlike many other manuals, there were even brief explanations of terms used in sound production. This was a well-designed, to-the-point manual that will enable anyone to get up and running with the system\u2026 but it should still draw better attention to the details regarding Mic and Instrument level settings! The Audio-Technica ATW-3110a wireless system ($699 MSRP) sells for closer to $400. You need to add the AT-GCW instrument cable ($24), and if you plan to install this in your rack, also be sure to order the ATW-RA1 kit ($48) for mounting the antennas in front of your rack. Despite the \u201ca la carte\u201d offerings, this system is still well priced compared to other systems in its class, and this may place a good UHF wireless system within your price range.

      "value": "The Rocktron MIDI Mate is a well-constructed and easy-to-use MIDI foot controller. Its compact footprint and simple layout combined with an easy-to-read display make it a great controller for guitar preamps and a decent performer for controlling your effects processors. We found that its use of a 2nd function button for changing banks of sounds was inconvenient and awkward, especially for use in a live situation where you\u2019re making changes rapidly, but we liked the Controller mode that enabled us to select from five patches at a time while having direct access to five continuous controllers plus an external expression pedal. While you can accomplish complex programming with relative ease, the MIDI Mate\u2019s functional operation and layout left us wishing for a few more CC pedals and dedicated bank Up/Down buttons. Still, we loved using it as a simple patch selector/controller for our Mesa/Boogie Triaxis guitar preamp. If you would prefer to control your rack-mounted preamp from its own dedicated controller (independent of your effects) as we sometime do, the MIDI Mate is a perfect solution, but it is less suited to controlling complex MIDI rigs than some similar products within its price range, or the significantly more advanced (but more costly) Rocktron All Access. If you\u2019re new to using MIDI foot controllers, we have an in-depth tutorial on the subject that you may wish to read before diving into our foot controller product reviews. The MIDI Mate is easy to use, and we had no trouble controlling a TC Electronic G-Major and a Lexicon MPX-1 with it. The foot controller starts out in Program Change mode, and an Access button lets you step through its three operating modes: Bank mode (ten pedals let you directly select effect presets from within a bank, and then bank Up/Down buttons switch between banks), Instant mode (press two buttons to directly select presets without having to change banks), and Controller mode. We had no problem assigning Program Change messages to a single pedal so that both of our effects processors could be set to new presets at the touch of a single button. The bank Up/Down buttons are actually secondary mode buttons that share pedals #0 and #1. To change banks of patches, you have to first step on a 2nd function button that converts pedals #0 and #1 to Up/Down selectors and then either step on a button #3 through #9 to select a program in that bank, or you have to step on the 2nd function button a second time to exit that mode \u2013 necessary if you want to select patch #1 in the new bank. In Controller mode, five buttons across the top row of the MIDI Mate provide the ability to send CC messages while the bottom row of pedals continue to send Program Change messages to your MIDI gear. Each of the top five buttons can be configured to send CC messages to devices on different MIDI channels. We easily configured the MIDI Mate to direct some CC messages to our G-Major and others to our MPX-1. This flexibility is great, but with only five CC pedals, the functionality is somewhat limited. Programming the MIDI Mate is straightforward, but we had some confusion initially activating the CC pedals. After assigning CC numbers to the pedals and to the expression pedal input, you have to assign the pedals to specific MIDI channels before they are enabled on the foot controller. Once we did this, everything worked fine. The pedals only function as latching devices, so if you have an effect processor that requires momentary pedals for features such as Tap Tempo, the MIDI Mate may not work for you. Additionally, we attached a Roland EV-5 Expression pedal and had no difficulties controlling various parameters in our G-Major. The documentation provided with the MIDI Mate was excellent and shouldn\u2019t scare away novices. It guided us through easy procedures for most of our configuration efforts, the only caveat being that it wasn\u2019t obvious that we needed to assign the CC pedals to specific MIDI channels before they would function. A one-minute call to Rocktron\u2019s knowledgeable technical support resolved this issue. There are no support documents on the Rocktron Web site for any products at this time \u2013 only downloadable copies of the User\u2019s Guides. Other vendors provide various help documents related to using their MIDI foot controllers (and other gear) online, and we think it\u2019s time for Rocktron to step up and add this useful service. The Rocktron MIDI Mate ($229) typically sells for near $160. Given its simple functionality with secondary mode switches and only five CC controllers, we think it is a little expensive compared to some of its competitors. Rocktron"
