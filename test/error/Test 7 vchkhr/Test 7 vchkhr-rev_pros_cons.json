      "value": "When you hear the name \u201cOcean Way,\u201d you probably picture the iconic studios that bear, or once bore, the name, where countless hit records have been recorded. Allen Sides, the legendary engineer behind those studios, also makes high-end studio monitors through his Ocean Way Audio brand. In commercial studios, you\u2019re more likely to find the company\u2019s three-way monitors with horns, often soffit-mounted in a control room. With large footprints and price tags north of $10,000, they\u2019re not practical for all but the most elaborate personal studios. But recently, Ocean Way Audio released the Pro3, which is the latest in its smaller (and less-expensive) OWA monitor line. The company refers to the Pro3 as its \u201cmost affordable\u201d monitor pair yet. At $3,000 for a pair, some might quibble with the term \u201caffordable,\u201d but it is within the range of many studios and recording musicians; to many, its high-end, pro-level sound quality makes it an exceptional value. The Pro3 monitors are the smallest that Ocean Way makes. The cabinets are designed to reduce baffle reflections and low-frequency resonance. Each monitor features a circular port at the top of the back panel. With dimensions of 9 x 14 x 13.5 (W x H x D) inches and weighing 23 pounds each, the Pro3 is small enough to fit in any-size room. They\u2019re two-way active monitors with plenty of power\u2014125W per side for the aluminum low-frequency driver and 90W for the silk fabric dome\u2013type tweeter. Compared to most studio monitors these days, you could call their control set \u201cminimalist.\u201d What there is resides on the back panel. The front of the Pro3 has only the woofer and tweeter. The power indicator light is on the rear, not the front. I\u2019m not sure I understand that design choice; to me, it makes more sense if you can see it from the listening position. The Pro3s offer two input options: Analog and Digital AES/EBU, both on XLR connectors. An AES/EBU digital XLR output is also included. The monitors can be switched between four different presets: Preset 1 is the default, with the analog inputs active. Preset 2 is also analog, for use with a subwoofer. When it\u2019s on, a fourth-order highpass filter rolls off at 85 Hz so as not to get in the way of the low frequencies coming from the sub. The other two presets are for digital input. Preset 3 sets the monitor to digital left input and Preset 4 to digital right. The process for changing presets is not what I\u2019d describe as user-friendly. Each monitor features a small recessed button on the back panel called the LED Selector. Near it is a series of four LEDs: two white and two red. The manual recommends using a \u201csmall blunt tool,\u201d or breaking off the end of a cotton swab to make adjustments. Pressing and holding the LED Selector for a second or more switches the white LED from 1 to 2, which toggles the active status of the analog and digital inputs. Quicker presses set the two red LEDs, which blink when you first adjust them. The combination of white and red LEDs that are lit determines which preset is active. Fortunately, you probably won\u2019t have to adjust them very often, if at all. I never thought I\u2019d find myself wishing for dip switches, but I did in this case. Each speaker also features a Master Volume control for trimming the output. It\u2019s recessed and requires a small screwdriver or a tweaker to adjust it. It\u2019s not detented, but has 10 position indicators printed around the recessed area, making it pretty easy to set the left and right evenly if you need to lower the volume. That\u2019s it for the controls, save for the power switch and voltage selector. Ocean Way Audio includes IEC power cables for each monitor. Somewhat surprisingly, there\u2019s no room correction filtering or EQ that you can deploy on the Pro3s other than the high-pass filter for subwoofers that\u2019s available with Preset 2. I set up the Pro3s in a nearfield configuration, placed on speaker stands on top of Primacoustic Recoil Stabilizers, which are thick and heavy monitor pads. The Pro3s don\u2019t have rubber feet, so you\u2019ll want to use pads or decoupling stands. I connected the Pro3s to the outputs of my Cranborne Audio 500R8 interface, opened Ableton Live and hit Play on a song I\u2019d been working on. My first thought was, \u201cThese monitors are really bright.\u201d But I soon realized that what I was reacting to was clarity. Everything in the mix sounded clearer and more present\u2014 the drum loops, the bass, the guitars and the keyboards. The transient reproduction was beyond impressive. When I switched back and forth between the Pro3s and my regular monitors (I\u2019m not naming names because it\u2019s an unfair fight), which I like a lot, the contrast was enormous. Not only are the Pro3s excellent for mixing, their sonic clarity makes them extremely helpful in adjusting mic placement when setting up for a tracking session. The bass response on the Pro3s is extremely tight and defined. The specs show that it goes down to 45 Hz. Mixing on the Pro3s, I found it easier to accurately gauge the level of the kick drum and bass than with my regular monitors. The imaging on the Pro3s is also impressive. According to the company, the frequency response between the two speakers is within \u00b10.5dB. I was curious how the Pro3s sounded at higher levels than the 70 \u2013 80 dB range I\u2019d been listening in. I cranked the music up to over 90 dB\u2014which, with the speakers less than three feet from my ears, was quite loud. I expected to hear the clarity diminish, but it didn\u2019t. The monitors sounded louder but otherwise no different than at lower volumes. If by chance you push the level up too high, the monitors are equipped with overload protection circuits that would prevent damage to the drivers and other components. I mixed a couple of full songs on the Pro3s and got excellent results. I noticed less ear fatigue than I was used to on either pair of monitors that I use regularly in my studio. The ability to listen longer before you have to stop for a long break, or until the next day, could be a real boon for mixing productivity. The last thing I tried was hooking up a subwoofer. I own a KRK 10s sub and connected its left and right outputs to the inputs of the Pro3s. After switching the monitors to Preset 2, to activate the high-pass filtering, I let it rip. With that extra bass, the overall sound of the system was magnificent. Ocean Way Audio makes a couple of subs, the S10A and the S12A, which would probably sound better matched with the Pro3s than what I tried out here. But even with a sub from another manufacturer, the results were stunning. Doing this review has been an eye-opening, or rather, an ear-opening experience for me. The Pro3s are hands-down the best-sounding monitors I\u2019ve used in my studio. I\u2019ve reviewed quite a few, but these stand above. As noted, I have a few small issues. One is the lack of room correction features. Incredible as the Pro3s sound, if you have acoustical issues in your studio that you need to compensate for, they\u2019ll be there no matter which monitors you use. I also wish they would add a front-panel power LED and that the switching system for the Presets was easier to use. But when weighed against the stunning sound quality and performance of these monitors, those issues pale to insignificance. The headline here is that from a sonic standpoint, the Pro3s are a revelation and definitely worth every penny. If you\u2019ve never considered spending three grand on a monitor system, you might want to change your mind.

      "value": "This was Mix\u2019s 20th most-read article of 2022! The Tolerance Modeling Technology developed by Brainworx is much more than a marketing term. It\u2019s a powerful and effective system for creating realistic software console emulations. With TMT, Brainworx (and its partner, Plugin Alliance ) builds its modeled components with the same tolerances as their hardware counterparts. That gives the console similar channel-to-channel variations as would be found in the hardware. Brainworx TMT plug-ins can have up to 72 independent channels, and none are exact copies of each other. Brainworx has already released models of SSL, Neve and Focusrite desks, and its latest product is an emulation of the AMEK 9098i, a legendary console built by the late Rupert Neve. Not only does the plug-in replicate that console\u2019s circuitry, it also adds plenty of useful \u201cdigital only\u201d features. According to Brainworx, the AMEK 9099 has the deepest feature set of any of the company\u2019s TMT channel strips. As you would expect from Brainworx, the plug-in is well designed. You can resize the GUI from 50% to 150%\u2014 a useful option\u2014while in addition to a global Mute button, every major component can be switched on and off, even the individual EQ bands. The signal chain begins with the input preamp and highpass and lowpass filters. The HPF defaults to a range of 20 Hz to 300 Hz, but you can press the x3 button to shift it up to 60 Hz to 900 Hz. The LPF defaults to 4.5 kHz to 30 kHz. It has a \u201c/3\u201d (divided by 3) button that lowers it to 1.5 kHz to 10 kHz. Both filters roll off at a healthy 18 dB per octave slope. The switchable ranges provide more filtering flexibility and were not on the 9098i. You can also switch the placement of the filter section in the signal chain from after the input to after the Gate and Compressor, or in the dynamics sidechain. The Gate section offers both Gate and Expander modes. The latter features an over-easy response. Pressing the Invert button lets you hear only what the Gate is attenuating, which can be useful when adjusting it. Other controls include Threshold and Range knobs. If you\u2019re dealing with really low-level signals, you can press the Threshold Range button, which lowers the whole range by 30 dB. The Ratio knob is for Expander Ratio and Gate Hold, depending on which mode you\u2019re in. Expander mode governs the attenuation ratio; Gate mode controls the time it takes for the gate to close after the signal drops below the threshold. The Gate Release control works the same in both modes, controlling the speed of attenuation. For the attack speed, you get three buttons: Fast, Medium and Slow. Finally, the Linear button toggles between the default linear release curve and the alternate, exponential one. The Gate section also offers an HPF with a Q control and an LPF that functions as a sidechain. The Key Listen button lets you hear the sidechain input signal soloed. I found the Gate/Expander to be both deep and flexible. I was able to dial in natural-sounding settings for reducing drum bleed, guitar buzz and more. The Compressor section, which emulates the hybrid digital-and-VCA Compressor in the 9098i, offers plenty of options, including the standard Threshold, Ratio, Attack and Release knobs, plus a button that turns on the handy Auto-Release feature. A Makeup Gain knob is available, as well. With the press of a button, you can toggle the Compressor between hard- and soft-knee operation. I was initially puzzled by a button labeled AMBNC, which stands for Ambience. When activated, it changes the Compressor\u2019s output to the difference between the compressed audio and the input signal. When there\u2019s no gain reduction, you won\u2019t hear anything with AMBNC on. The manual promises that the AMBNC lets you hear better what the Compressor is doing, but, for me at least, it was more confusing than helpful. That said, you can use it as an effect to create sounds that differ from either the compressed or uncompressed signal. Brainworx also added two \u201cplug-in-only\u201d features to the Compressor section\u2014a Mix knob for dialing in parallel compression and a dedicated High-Pass Filter situated at the beginning of the Compressor\u2019s sidechain. The AMBNC control notwithstanding, I found the Compressor section to be excellent for dynamics control. Its tone is quite transparent, which is either a plus or minus, depending on what you\u2019re trying to do. I was hoping it would have a little more of a \u201csound\u201d to it. Fortunately, if you want character, the Limiter, which is separate from the Compressor and a mix of 9098i features and plug-in-only additions, has plenty to offer. The original features include the Threshold and Release knobs and a Fast Attack button. One of the plug-in-only features is a Makeup Gain knob, which is handy considering the Limiter\u2019s ability to squash the signal. The Mix knob is also not from the original, but I\u2019m glad Brainworx added it. Often, I got the best results by dialing in an extreme setting and then backing off the Mix knob, making the limiting parallel. The Clip button was also added. When you press it, the Release Time knob disappears, and both the attack and release times become extremely fast. The result is a saturated sound that you can further intensify by pressing the Fast Attack button. I definitely liked the Limiter and found ways to use it on almost every channel. The EQ section is mainly true to the 9098i, although Brainworx made it more versatile for frequency selection. It offers four bands: High-Frequency, High-Mid Frequency, Low- Mid Frequency and Low-Frequency. Being able to switch each band on and off was handy for checking their effect on the sound as you go. The HF is semi-parametric with a knob for frequency selection (2 kHz to 21 kHz). You can switch it between a high-shelving filter and a peak filter. A button called Sheen switches either filter to a more gradual curve. The HMF is fully parametric, with Gain (\u00b118 dB), Frequency (500 Hz to 4.5 kHz) and Q knobs. The HMF x2 button, which wasn\u2019t on the 9098i, changes the frequency range for the band to double the original, moving it to 1 kHz to 9 kHz, which significantly overlaps the HF. If you want to apply a more surgical boost or cut, the HMF x2 button is handy. Speaking of surgical, you can press a button and switch the HMF filter from Peak to Notch, which is unusual for a channel strip but a nice capability to have in your back pocket. Other than its frequency range, the LMF band is a lot like the HMF. It has all the same controls except that instead of a x2 button, it has one labeled \u201c/2\u201d (divided by two). Pressing it switches the LMF range from 100 Hz to 1 kHz to 50 Hz to 500 Hz. It is also similar in architecture to the HF, with a range of 30 Hz to 300 Hz, and you can switch the filter from low-shelving to peak. A Glow button, rather than Sheen, softens the filters. An EQ In switch globally bypasses all the bands and a Routing button lets you choose where in the signal chain the EQ will reside. Finally, you get an Auto Listen button that solos the section where you made your most recent adjustment of frequency or Q. Without question, the EQ section is more complex than is typical on a channel strip, but it\u2019s quite powerful and flexible. The Master section of the AMEK 9099 is fully stocked, starting with a nice-sized meter section that offers both a VU and a Peak version that reads out in dBu. You can switch them to show input or output. Right below are five-step LED ladder meters for the Gate, Compressor and Limiter. Two knobs with on/off switches\u2014Mono Maker and Stereo Width\u2014sit at the bottom of stereo channels. Mono Maker is useful because any signal below the frequency you set gets folded into mono. That allows you to, for example, tighten up the stereo image of a track in the sub 200 Hz range (which sound more focused in mono anyway) while leaving the higher frequencies intact. Stereo Width is excellent for widening tracks without making them lose punch. It stays natural-sounding until you get above about two-thirds of the knob\u2019s range. Other controls include Phase (polarity) invert and the global Mute button. You also get several features specific to the TMT emulation, including the THD knob, which lets you add harmonic distortion to the channel. You can also add extremely subtle noise to the signal for increasing the analog simulation by turning up the V (virtual) Gain knob. Also in the Master section are buttons that let you randomize which of the 72 available virtual channels you\u2019re using on a given instance of the plug-in. You can randomize a particular channel with the One button, or every instance in your session with the All button. On the far right, where it says Stereo Mode, you have two choices: Analog means that all stereo channels will have different channels assigned to their left and right sides. Digital means that stereo channels will have the same virtual channel assigned to them. All of the TMT features are subtle, particularly when you\u2019re dealing with one channel. But by using instances of AMEK 9099 on all mixer channels, you get a consistent sound reminiscent of a mixing desk. The AMEK 9099 gives you what you need to sculpt and mix in any genre. If you want clean, it gives you that. If you want vibey, it can do that, too. Some of its features are relatively complex, but its essential functions are intuitive enough, even for a novice. It\u2019s the kind of plug-in that you can grow into. The more you use it, the more you\u2019ll get from it. Overall, it\u2019s highly impressive. It is somewhat pricey, but Plugin Alliance runs plenty of sales if you\u2019re patient. If you want it right away but don\u2019t want to spring for the full price, it\u2019s included in several of the Plugin Alliance subscription bundles, which allow you to get your hands on a huge range of plug-ins for a low monthly fee."
