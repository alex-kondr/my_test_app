      "value": "Since its inception in 2004 as a stereo-only unit, the Avocet Discrete Class-A Monitor Controller has evolved through revisions and functional enhancements to become Crane Song\u2019s most successful product, with the Avocet IIA the pinnacle of Dave Hill\u2019s design. Reviewed here is the Avocet IIA stereo system, comprising a two-rackspace audio chassis connected (over a 25-foot cable) to the Avocet Remote II tabletop unit. For surround sound monitoring, up to four 2U audio chassis can be controlled from a single Avocet Remote to accommodate up to 7.1 channels (three chassis required for 5.1). For surround operation, the rear panel 25-pin D-sub accessory sockets are repurposed (internal ribbon cable change) so that each chassis is interconnected to operate in designated pairs of surround channels. An experienced tech can handle the proper connections. The Avocet Remote IIA (firmware 12) retains the familiar and basic look of previous versions, with its 24 flush-mounted push-buttons surrounding a large green master volume/gain parameter control (encoder) knob and 20-segment LED level meter. The horizontal top row of Left, Right, Center, LFE, SL, SR, EXL, EXR channel selection buttons includes an additional row of eight Shift-Setup Mode sub-functions. The encoder and all buttons are made by Grayhill. The switches are rated at 500,000 cycles, while the encoder is rated at 1 million operations. On the rear panel of the remote is a 15-pin D-sub for connection to the audio chassis, plus an XLR input for a talkback mic. I have the Remote II sitting on the right side of my desktop, angled slightly up. All behaviors, setups and configurations of the Avocet system are handled through the remote. After selecting a function and then holding its button down until its LED flashes\u2014about a half-second\u2014you\u2019ll be in Gain trim mode. There is also a blue Shift-mode button for setting certain functions, static configurations, and Talkback mic level and monitor Dim level. The IIA allows all output levels to be adjusted in .25dB steps (maximum -15.75 dB), so there is no more need of inline attenuator pads to match different level requirements of powered speakers and/or power amps. The Avocet IIA (stereo version only) also adds a fourth full-range balanced output, called Direct Sub Mode, making it possible to set individual subwoofer levels for each of the three monitor speaker outputs. I like that the Avocet does not do bass management. I prefer to use a sub with a built-in variable low-pass filter. When powered on, the Avocet comes up in Mute mode while the saved settings and firmware load, with enough time allowed for stabilization of the new Quantum digital-to-analog converter. When powered off, all configurations and resident firmware version are held in an EEPROM chip. I tested Avocet\u2019s latest stereo audio chassis (firmware 13.1). The entire audio path is discrete analog electronics with balanced output amps and premium op-amp chips around the Quantum DAC, the same converter and clock used in Crane Song\u2019s standalone Solaris DAC and Hedd Quantum A/D-D/A and Clock Generator products. It is the company\u2019s fifth-generation design, with less than one picosecond of jitter that upsamples to 211 kHz and uses a proprietary reconstruction filter. The chassis\u2019 rear panel bristles with 12 analog and five digital connectors. There are three stereo sets of XLR analog line-level inputs, each with recessed individual channel \u00b18dB input trim pots and three sets of stereo monitor speaker XLR outputs. I use the three analog inputs for computer core audio output (bumped to +4 dBm), a 2-track analog tape deck, and my turntable\u2019s RIAA preamp line out. There are five digital input connectors with up to 192kHz sample rates possible. The DAW input is an AES/EBU XLR connector, as are Digital 1 and Digital 2. There are also S/PDIF RCA and Toslink optical inputs. Using the remote\u2019s Setup mode, you can designate the main DAW input to be either the AES, S/PDIF or Optical, while the Digital 1 and 2 remain fixed AES/EBU\u2013only. I found this to work out well by using the DAW input connected to my Pro Tools I/O\u2019s Enclosure out XLR; my Tascam CD player\u2019s output to Digital 1; and a Panasonic DAT tape deck for Digital 2. Volume level is adjustable using the large green encoder volume knob in 1dB steps. Level settings are accurate and repeatable, with green LEDs surrounding the knob in 2dB steps. The relays switch in various precision, thin-film (1 percent and 0.1 percent) resistor values. The channels match within 0.02 dB. The familiar sounds of relays clicking when touching any button or adjusting volume up or down are still there, though significantly quieter than my Avocet 1. Even with the audio chassis in my outboard rack next to my mix position, I couldn\u2019t hear them. The rear panel finishes with a DB15 Remote connector, a power on/off switch, IEC/fuse power jack, and a 1/4-inch jack (mirrored on the front panel) for the built-in headphone amp. Headphone audio is also available as unbalanced audio on channels 3 and 4 of the rear panel DB25 accessory socket wired in Tascam format. The remote functions/buttons include: a 16-bit mode for hearing 24-bit audio dithered down to compare to CD digital input; Phase (polarity) flip; a Mono (L + R) sum; programmable Dim level; and Mute and Talkback buttons. Talkback switching and audio is available on the accessory socket, as are the metering voltage and the Direct Sub Mode balanced outputs. Having used my Avocet I since 2008, I am familiar and happy with its operation as a full-featured analog console \u201ccenter section,\u201d The Avocet has been critical for creating stereo mixes, as I require the ability to quickly reference disparate yet level-matched digital or analog stereo sources at any time quickly and without compromise. I also like the precision of the volume control, as well as the stereo LED meter built into the Remote II. It is handy to log a specific number around the level knob to reference the playback volume of various mixes or music cues for comparison. Since switching over to the Avocet IIA, I\u2019m noticing a big improvement in the monitored sound of my mixes and other sources I know well. With the Quantum, panned track elements are more stable laterally between the speakers and the sense of stereo width, space and the reconstruction of the sound stage are much more vivid. In a recent mix I did, I heard a distortion on the lead vocal I didn\u2019t catch before. Going back and listening using my old DAC, it was there but not as obvious and in my face! I like the fidelity improvement when using the Direct Sub Mode since the entire stereo mix is not running through my subwoofer with my two Adam S2.5As running as \u201csatellite\u201d L/R speakers. Plus using the remote, it\u2019s easy to toggle the sub on/off and set its level for each of the three monitor speaker outs. I can turn on and set an appropriate level for my NS10Ms and my little Reftone cubes\u2014so much fun to hear. With complete instructions included, I also found calibrating all outputs much easier. If you change power amps or powered speakers, you can get them dialed in immediately. With the Quantum DAC, Direct Sub Mode, and precision output level adjustment now included, the Crane Song Avocet IIA is the best version yet of this stalwart stereo, 5.1 or 7.1 monitor controller. I can\u2019t work without it! Barry Rudolph is a Los Angeles\u2013based audio engineer and educator. Visit him at www.barryrudolph.com Company: Crane Song Ltd. Product: Avocet IIA Monitor Controller Website: cranesong.com/avocet.html Price: $3,149 (stereo version) Pros: High-fidelity, transparent analog monitor controller; expandable to 5.1 or 7.1 surround. Cons: None found. The Avocet has both a Phase flip and Mono button. By pushing both buttons while listening to a stereo mix, you can hear all non-correlated audio (L-R) in your mix or any other stereo source. It\u2019s revealing and another essential audio tool."

      "value": "For the past year, I\u2019ve been running into Apollos everywhere, and it seems like anyone who has heard UAD plug-ins immediately realizes that they can\u2019t live without them and buys an Apollo or a UAD-2 system. Granted, there are plenty of other innovations coming from new-school plug-in manufacturers that do things that could never be accomplished by outboard gear. But when you instantiate a UAD processor, it\u2019s like firing up the real thing. When using any classic hardware, I get this feeling like I\u2019m harnessing the power of every great engineer and musician that has ever passed signal through that same circuit. The UAD plug-ins give me that same feeling. If you have them, you want to use a lot of them, but there have always been a few key hang-ups and roadblocks. Unlike SSL, Universal Audio has never issued Native versions of its plug-ins; they only run on UAD-2 hardware. This means you have to buy UAD-2-friendly hardware and get it connected to your computer. But when you use up all of the chips in your UAD-2 hardware, it doesn\u2019t matter how much CPU headroom you have left on your computer because you cannot insert any additional UAD-2 plug-ins. However, recent developments have helped to alleviate these concerns. The issue has always been that UAD-2 processors are going to do a lot of math and try to turn it around fast enough so that latency is kept to a minimum. In order for that to be possible, data has to get to those chips through a high-bandwidth bus. PCIe is preferable, and while FireWire 800 has been deemed an acceptable solution, the low bandwidth relative to PCIe means that the FireWire Satellite introduces more latency than its PCIe equivalent. Also, Universal Audio offers a QUAD version of the UAD-2 Satellite DSP Accelerator. For a while, the solution to this has been a Thunderbolt PCIe expansion chassis for UAD-2 cards, or a Thunderbolt expansion card for Apollo. The newest devices in the UAD-2 family, however, are Thunderbolt-ready powerhouses right out of the box. On the Apollo side, there is the slick, compact Apollo Twin. This is a small, desktop interface with one or two SHARC processors. On the UAD-2 side, there is the new UAD-2 Satellite Thunderbolt, a low-profile, fan-free, Thunderbolt-connected box that can house your choice of one, two, four, or eight SHARC procoessors. Apollo Twin DUO The Apollo Twin features a stylish, well-built housing with a small footprint that doesn\u2019t eat up too much space on a desktop. On the back panel, to the far right, is a pair of XLR/TRS combo jacks that can receive mic or line-level signals. To the left of those are four TRS outputs, two of which are designated \u201cMonitor L and R.\u201d The other pair is an additional set of line output jacks. These can be used to feed a mixdown deck, or would be useful in creating a hardware effects loop. On the far left of the back panel, there is a connector to attach the wall-wart power supply, and next to that, a power switch. Above these, you\u2019ll find a Toslink connector that can accept eight channels of ADAT while also accommodating S/PDIF or S/MUX. Next to the Toslink connector is a single Thunderbolt jack. The Thunderbolt situation is absolutely something to consider when contemplating the purchase of an Apollo Twin. For one, no Thunderbolt cable is included, so you will have to make that investment. But the bigger issue is that the Apollo Twin only has one Thunderbolt connector. If your machine only has one port, you will not be able to daisy-chain anything else to that connector. I have not yet seen a simple multi-port Thunderbolt hub, so you won\u2019t be able to use an external display unless it is an Apple Thunderbolt Display that has two connectors. Fortunately, newer Macs have multiple Thunderbolt ports. The top surface of the Apollo Twin slopes up from front to back, making it comfortable to view and reach the top panel controls when seated. At the center of the top panel is a very large knob attached to an endless rotary encoder. The knob feels well built. It doesn\u2019t wiggle or tilt when turning. Overall it has a smooth, comfortable feel. The knob can be made to control the level of either of the two inputs, or it can be repurposed as a monitor level control. Buttons labeled \u201cPreamp\u201d and \u201cMonitor\u201d toggle the selection, while single-tapping \u201cMonitor\u201d repurposes the knob as a level control for the front panel headphone jack. Flanking the knob on either side are two pairs of five-segment LED meters displaying the input level of each channel on the left, and the level of whichever output signal is being controlled. Tapping the Preamp button repeatedly toggles control of the two inputs, and the two inputs can be linked with a Link button. Controls for highpass filter, phantom power, pad and polarity flip are addressed by individual hardware buttons on the top panel. Switching between mic and line-level gain controls is accomplished by pressing the Input toggle control, but a connection present on the front panel instrument jack will override either selection and take over input Number One. Having dedicated buttons for all of this functionality means that it is rarely necessary to take trips to a software control panel. More and more, it seems that the alternative route is taken, but it just seems so much more efficient and ergonomic to have the buttons right there next to the level control. Apollo Console Building headphone mixes, including low-latency input signals, requires a trip to the software mixer. While many devices include a purely utilitarian mixer, with the sole purpose of blending low-latency inputs with software outputs, the Apollo Console sweetens the deal with a plethora of bells and whistles. The theoretical design of any software mixer is to replace the need for a small routing console in the control room. The Apollo Console gives you a full-on, large-format console with your choice of mic preamps, a variety of different routing buses, cue sends, effects sends and returns\u2014any of which can be combined and sent to any of the hardware outputs. Its built-in DSP provides access to the entire fleet of UAD plug-ins for use in any part of a zero-latency mix. You can use either of the Twin\u2019s hardware inputs and run them through an entire channel strip of low-latency processing. In the first place, signal can run through a virtual mic preamp; currently, a Neve 1073 with EQ, a UA 610 with EQ, and an API Vision channel strip are available. The wildest part is that adjusting the preamp knobs within the plug-in actually sends the message back to the hardware, and adjusts the analog gain accordingly. Once the desired color is achieved, the signal can be dressed with a chain of up to four hardware inserts. Running through four plug-ins plus a virtual preamp without picking up any noticeable latency seems utterly impossible to me, but after hearing it, I can attest to the fact that Twin can absolutely pull it off. I also assumed that only a stripped down set of plug-ins would be available, because there would be no way that some of the more complicated processors could turn around the math that quickly, but everything was there. Even with some heavy-hitters like an AMS reverb and an ENGL guitar amp and others all running in coincidence, the guitar pick called and the system responded in perfect sync. Apollo Console\u2019s potential applications span beyond studio recording, considering all of its available processing power and the fact that Apollo Console is a stand-alone application that doesn\u2019t require a host DAW. Given its low latency, DJs and musicians could absolutely use Apollo Console as a live rig. Console configurations can be saved and any snapshot can be recalled with a click of the mouse, so having a hardware setup per song is totally feasible. Radio broadcasters and podcasters could also certainly benefit from using the software\u2019s virtual preamps and processors in real time. Field Test When I first fired up the Twin, I spent a lot of time just listening to its D/A converters and getting familiar with them. I listened to a lot of music, and when I felt like I had a handle on the sound I mixed a trailer using the unit as my DAW back end, feeding my monitors. My initial impression was that it sounded extremely clean and clear. The bottom end was generous, respectably tight, and seemed honest. The midrange was incredibly open and detailed, and there was a great separation of the individual components in every mix I heard. The top end extended nicely, without being edgy or garbled in any way. The more I listened, the more I noticed that the upper midrange did seem slightly forward. It didn\u2019t sound bad. In fact, it actually made everything sound a little clearer, even when listening at lower volumes, but that kind of dishonesty can sometimes lead to real troubles when mixing. As I got into doing actual work with the Twin, I found myself in a situation with a lot of noisy production sound requiring treatment. When applying noise reduction, there is always a fine line between making it sound better and adding artifacts. The Twin\u2019s circuitry was kind of like a magnifying glass, zeroing in on that area where the articulation of the dialog lives and where garbled digital artifacts are most noticeable. I was able to find that edge of reduction versus destruction with ease, and always stay on the safe side of it. Processing the dialog and keeping it ahead of the music bed also came very naturally when monitoring with the Twin\u2019s outputs. When all was said and done, I took the mix around to the usual tour of iPhone, laptop, TV and other consumer speakers to check compatibility, and the mix translated incredibly well. Even in the worst-case scenarios, the dialog was clear and intelligible, and the music was not lost. The Twin\u2019s inputs have a sound that is similar to the outputs. I heard an especially wide dynamic range as the noise floor seemed very low. The detail and clarity of everything the Twin captured was impeccably preserved. The converters are really nice, and the preamp has incredible definition throughout the entire frequency spectrum, and imparts only the slightest color in the upper midrange. There is a little sparkle, but only in the best way possible. Running the preamp through the 1073 preamp model was exciting. In contrast to the stock sound of the preamp, the 1073 model had that dark, warm, British character that Neve is known for. Shooting the UAD version against a hardware clone of that circuit was eerie: The sound was nearly identical. On a snare drum, both circuits presented the same warmth throughout the body of the snare. The top end, in both cases, cracked open into a pleasant, subtle, harmonic overdrive. A similar sound was present in a kick drum recording. The beater had a nice bristle that could cut through a mix, while the bottom was actually a bit fuller on the UAD version than the hardware. Altogether, the Apollo Twin\u2019s build, sound quality and overall operation are impressive. Once I installed the software, my computer recognized the unit every time it was attached. If there is anything to complain about, it would be the fact that we always just want more UAD plug-ins, and the two cores inside the Twin DUO are, at times, just not enough. With just the included DSP, the system maxed out at eight tracks of Studer A800. One EMT 140 eats up nearly 20 percent of the DSP. Putting a pair of 610s across the inputs takes about 30 percent of the DSP available. Granted, a healthy complement of 19 1176 Legacy compressors can run simultaneously. If you need more, however, Apollo Expanded has you in mind. Now, you can string together a number of UAD-2 Thunderbolt devices and aggregate their processing power. This is where the UAD-2 Satellite Thunderbolt comes to the rescue. TRY THIS When tracking guitars or re-amping them through miked amplifiers, sometimes multiple mics on one amp are required to get the right sound. Soloing each mic and placing it at the ideal position can lead to good individual sounds that combine into a comb-filtered mess. This problem can be eradicated before the 1s and 0s ever hit Pro Tools by using the UAD Little Labs IBP plug-in across the appropriate channel within the Apollo Console and sending the result to Pro Tools. Product Summary COMPANY: Universal Audio PRODUCT: Apollo Twin DUO WEBSITE: www.uaudio.com PRICE: $899 PROS: Hardware buttons for controls. Well-built. Loaded with features. CONS: Only connects with Thunderbolt. No second port to daisy chain. Satellite Thunderbolt OCTO The Satellite is a very attractive, extremely portable, sturdily built black box housing your choice of additional DSP for your system. It can run on its own, providing UAD-2 processing to your DAW. Multiple Satellite units can be attached, or you can pair the Satellite with an Apollo system to gain additional DSP. The Satellite is not bus-powered and requires a provided external power supply, through a 4-pin XLR-type connector on the back panel. Other than that, the back panel features a rocker-style power switch and two Thunderbolt ports. I could attach the Satellite and then still connect an external display to my MacBook. Alternatively, I could daisy chain the Apollo Twin through the Satellite and combine the processing power of both units. Installing the Satellite\u2019s software was a bit of a process, but once it was done, as with the Twin, there were no issues of any kind. When I first started out, I was running UAD-2 Version 7, and the unit was recognized immediately whenever I would connect it. There were never any hang-ups or issues, the system ran flawlessly all of the time. The UAD software displays a small usage meter that is small enough to stay open on a corner of the display. Three meters display available DSP, Program Memory and UAD RAM. As different processors use different amounts of each, one could max out before the others, so it is useful to monitor each factor. When attaching the Twin and the Satellite, the total resources available when combining the two were summed and displayed on these meters. When it comes to the individual devices and their individual chips, opening the larger UAD Control Panel can provide more insight. Here, each hardware device is listed in a scrolling menu, and within each device the status of each core is displayed. The system does a round-robin allocation of processing, distributing little bits of work to each available chip. With eight cores to work with, I never came close to running out of DSP when doing music mixes. Considering that you could run 384 mono dbx 160s, or one EMT 250 takes up 1 percent of the total processing power, the sky is the limit. A full instance chart is available on Universal Audio\u2019s Website: www.uaudio.com/support/uad/compatibility/instance-chart.html . Via the plug-ins tab, additional UAD-2 plug-ins can be authorized or demoed. It\u2019s almost too easy to start a demo and fall in love with a new must-have plug-in. Part if this ease is due to the fact that all of the UAD-2 plug-ins are installed in the initial setup, whether they are licensed or not. While this makes the addition of new plug-ins to your system a snap, it is a little awkward when accessing the plug-ins in a DAW. Whether you have a license for the processor or not, the lists in Pro Tools are exploding with options. I constantly find myself loading a plug-in only to find out that it is not authorized or that the demo is timed out. It\u2019s a cruel tease. I suppose the solution is to simply buy them all. The UAD-2 Satellite Thunderbolt OCTO is a no-brainer. Considering that the PCIe OCTO card is the same price, the fact that Universal Audio is essentially throwing in a Thunderbolt chassis with power supply for no extra charge makes the Satellite Thunderbolt a killer deal. If you\u2019re adding on to an Apollo system, it seems like you can probably get away with just adding a QUAD, because I feel like six cores are plenty. That said, I was using it on music mixes with right around 30 tracks. If you do much larger mixes than that, you might need to go bigger. My only words of warning would be to proceed with caution. Every plug-in has a 14-day demo, and if you try one, you will almost certainly buy it. TRY THIS I really like the sound of the Thermionic Culture Vulture emulation from UAD. It\u2019s great for warming and thickening a 2-bus or for mastering. Working with the Triode setting and the overdrive switches engaged, push the Drive until the track starts to distort. Then, tweak the Drive and Bias to the point where the track is crispy and buzzing, but there is still clear intelligibility to the key elements of the mix, like snare and vocals. Then take the mix control all the way down, and slowly sneak it back up until you hear the mix thicken up.
