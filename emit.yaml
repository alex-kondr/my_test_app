      value: The Sony ZV-E10 is an APS-C mirrorless camera designed for vloggers and video creators, and faces powerful rivals in a fast-growing sector. Our reviewer Richard Sibley checks it out
    - type: conclusion
      value: Based on price alone the ZV-E10 should prove a very popular camera and certainly improves on the video credentials of its chief rival at launch, the Canon EOS M50 Mark II , which is a go-to camera for most YouTubers. It also serves as a gateway to purchasing a high-end full-frame camera such as the Alpha 7 IV in the future, as well as any of the 60 Sony E-mount lenses, not to mention the equally numerous third-party options. Its rivals include the Canon EOS R50 (essentially an RF-mount EOS M50 II) and the Nikon Z30 which is slighter cheaper than the Sony, although both lack the wide lens choice enjoyed by the ZV-E10. For content creators there are few creative things that the ZV-E10 won’t allow you to do, and beneath its lightweight plastic exterior it packs quite a punch. For photographers it is the equivalent of a modern day point and shoot when left with its rather average kit lens. But paired with a better lens the full potential of the sensor can be realised. The more limited controls will slow you down and they may frustrate at times, but with the extensive feature set, excellent autofocus and an 11fps shooting rate, you will rarely not be able to get the shot that you want. Perhaps the bigger question is where the ZV cameras leave the future of both the A6000 and RX-series cameras, particularly with the Sony Xperia Pro-I smartphone featuring a 1-inch type sensor. But that is a discussion for another day.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Sony ZV-E10 is a low-cost entry-level camera designed for beginner vloggers and smartphone upgraders who want to get more serious about video, though it also works as a pretty good 24-megapixel stills camera. Could it be one of Sony’s best cameras for those on a budget? This sector has developed into a very competitive market, though, and its rivals include the slightly cheaper Nikon Z30 which is aimed at a similar audience, while Canon is represented by the EOS R50 with its impressive AF system. Whilst internet forums may ring to the wails of photographers exclaiming ‘I don’t care about vlogging!’ there is a whole generation beavering away over on Web 2.0 documenting every facet of their lives via short videos on TikTok or Instagram , or even live streaming on Twitch. It is this these, generally younger, creators that Sony is catering to with its ZV-E10 – a camera with a fully articulated screen that can face forwards, a large, dedicated record button and a Product Showcase mode. In fact, it’s all unsurprisingly similar to the earlier ZV-1 . Except this time, the 1-in sensor and fixed 24-70mm equivalent lens has been replaced with an APS-C sensor and a choice of lenses thanks to the adoption of Sony’s E mount, which presumably is what the ‘E’ in ZV-E10 stands for. For more options have a look at the best Sony cameras and also the best Sony E-mount lenses . Sony ZV-E10 at a glance: Although the ZV-E10 camera itself may be Sony’s newest APS-C model, the technology and design are not. It uses much of the core technology from the more stills-focused Sony A6400 and A6100. What differentiates the ZV-E10 from those cameras is a range of features designed for entry-level video, including a 3-capsule microphone, Product Showcase mode and a Background Blur feature. Video creation is very much at the forefront, with photography playing with the reserve team. Sony ZV-E10 Features With the emphasis on tried and tested technology it is no surprise that the ZV-E10 uses a 24.2-million-pixel APS-C size Exmor CMOS sensor. Sony has been using 24-million-pixel APS-C sensors for a decade now, since we first saw one in the NEX-7, although the ZV-E10’s is no doubt the same more modern sensor that is found in the current Sony A6000-series cameras. It is capable of capturing images at the same 11fps, and whilst the standard sensitivity range is the same covering ISO 100-32,000, the maximum extended setting is ISO 51,200 on the ZV-E10, the same as the A6100 but lower than the A6400’s ISO 102,400. One big difference compared to the A6000-series cameras that might rule out the ZV-E10 for some photographers is that there’s no electronic viewfinder . This is obviously a strategic decision given that the target audience for the camera is most likely more used to looking at a phone screen, and also will be on a more limited budget. As such the lack of an EVF helps to bring the ZV-E10 in at a very reasonable price of $698 / £670 body only, compared to $748 / £679 for the A6100 and $898 / £899 for the A6400. I think this represents very good value for money for the entry-level photographer or videographer, or someone more seasoned looking to try their hand at video for social media. The A6100 and A6400 are more expensive, but they do have electronic viewfinders. More telling is the fact that the entry-level EOS R50 does too, and at a cost of $679 / £789, it could prove the ZV-E10’s biggest rival. It’s worth noting that unlike most recent mirrorless cameras, the ZV-E10 lacks sensor-based image stabilisation . This is normal on mirrorless cameras at this price point, however. You have to pay a lot more to get a camera with IBIS. Those wanting image stabilisation for stills will be relying on lens-based stabilisation, which is featured in the E 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 OSS kit lens. For video users there is electronic stabilisation. Make no mistake, the video that the ZV-E10 records isn’t on par with the Sony A7S III , A1 or even the new A7 IV. But with 4K at up to 30fps, Full HD at up to 120fps and a Slow and Quick Motion mode that allows for time-lapse style video that can be shot as slow as 1fps, there is more than enough for budding vloggers to get stuck in to. In addition, all of Sony’s usual Picture Profiles are featured, except the very video-centric S-Cinetone setting. Continuing the video theme there are both microphone and headphone sockets, as well as a large 3 capsule microphone on the top of the camera. If you want to improve the sound quality further then there is a Multi Interface hot shoe for mounting an additional microphone, and this can power and act as an audio interface for microphones such as Sony’s ECM-B1M. Sony ZV-E10 – 6 Things You Need To Know Sony ZV-E10 Build and Handling As previously stated, the ZV-E10 feels very much like a larger version of the ZV-1. It is fairly compact, has a lightweight, but solid construction that comes in weighing just 343g body only, and it isn’t overly cluttered with buttons. The
        button array seems designed to be non-intimidating to the first-time camera owner, whilst providing enough controls to get key settings changed efficiently, rather than quickly. Anyone who has previously used a Sony camera should feel at home with the ZV-E10, and that goes as much for the menu system as it does the external controls. The camera lacks the front control dial found on more advanced cameras, and forgoes a mode dial, which makes it slower to switch from, say aperture or shutter priority to manual exposure mode. But on the whole it is fairly straightforward and functional. There is a dedicated video record button and a zoom toggle around the shutter button that can be used either with Power Zoom lenses or as a digital zoom control. Perhaps the biggest feature on the camera is the fully articulated screen . This comes out at the side and can be set front-facing for vlogging, or folded in towards the camera to protect the screen when it is being thrown around in a backpack. In either scenario, it is a better choice for vloggers than the tilt-only screens found on the A6100 and A6400. Sony ZV-E10 Performance Image quality wise this is a very tried and trusted sensor that performs well, without ever leaving you speechless. As you would expect the ISO 100-400 settings offer peak performance both for image quality and maximising dynamic range, with ISO 800-1600 showing a drop in quality. But even at the maximum ISO 32,000 setting images are still perfectly useable, particularly with a smartphone screen the most likely destination for the majority of images shot with the camera. The extended settings are acceptable for use on smaller screens, rather than making gallery size prints. Again, there are no surprises here when you consider the target audience and cost of the camera. What is reasonably impressive is the incorporation of Sony autofocus staples, including Animal AF and Eye-AF . The latter excels just as well in video as it does in still images, which again is great news for those who want to turn the camera on themselves. The Active SteadyShot stabilisation works very well for keeping subjects still when shooting hand-held, although it does come at a cost of cropping into the image. For this reason, I would recommend those wanting to vlog at arm’s length opt for the Sony E 10-18mm F4 OSS lens, with its 15mm equivalent field of view. I found this lens to pair nicely with the ZV-E10 in terms of size, weight and AF speed. But let’s put video aside for one moment and focus on the stills photography. I found the ZV-E10 to be a capable little travel companion, particularly with the compact 16-50mm lens. Set to aperture priority it is easy to make use of the exposure compensation button and Quick Menu to make exposure and colour adjustments, while Face and EyeAF made it ideal for shots of my family. Yes, I missed having front control, exposure mode and compensation dials. But the reality is that it didn’t really slow me down that much, especially as I was using it like many content creators would, as a travel camera.'

      value: Sony’s compact-bodied full-frame mirrorless model is disappointingly flawed
    - type: conclusion
      value: Then there’s the kit zoom, which precisely because of its small size, manages to negate most of the potential advantages of the full-frame sensor. If you’re looking for nicely blurred backgrounds, or low-noise images in low light, it simply won’t deliver. Instead, the A7C is a much better vehicle for compact primes such as Sony’s lovely 35mm f/1.8, or small zooms like the 24-70mm f/4. But even these lenses will still be much more pleasant to use on a better-designed body, even if it is a bit larger. This might all be forgivable if the A7C were cheap, but instead its price is in the same ballpark as the A7 III or such fine alternatives as the Panasonic Lumix S5 and Nikon Z 6 . Even the newer Lumix S5 II and Nikon Z6 II aren’t a whole lot more expensive. And I can’t really see any situation where I’d recommend the A7C ahead of them. Ultimately if you want an excellent small full-frame camera from Sony, do yourself a favour and buy the A7 III instead. Read our detailed comparison between the Alpha 7C and the Alpha 7 III
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Is Sony’s ultra-compact, lightweight full-frame Alpha body the perfect option for those people looking for their first ‘proper’ camera? Find out in our detailed Sony A7C review. Sony Alpha 7C at a glance: Launched in 2020, the Alpha A7C sits at the bottom of Sony’s A7 series of full-frame mirrorless cameras . The camera boasts many of the core features of the popular Sony A7 III but in a smaller body that adds a fully articulated LCD to a design that resembles Sony’s range of APS-C sensor Alpha bodies. The Sony A7C didn’t replace the A7 III (and nor did the Sony A7 IV replace the A7C); instead, the A7C represented a new strand of the firm’s full-frame line-up and, as of 2023, Sony has yet to introduce a Mark II. The newer Sony ZV-E1 might appear similar, but it’s a higher-end video-first model with no viewfinder, while the A7C is a more affordable all-round hybrid camera. These are some of the best Sony cameras in 2023 for enthusiasts and professionals alike. The A7C is Sony’s response to competing ‘entry-level’ full-frame cameras such as the Canon EOS RP and Nikon Z5 , which are designed to provide an affordable option for those who want to take their first steps into full-frame photography and the extra resolution it provides. This is a hotly-contested area, and now includes the Canon EOS R8 and APS-C Fujifilm X-S20 . The Canon does not have IBIS, however, and the X-S20 has a smaller sensor. The Sony A7C remains a strong proposition with in-body stabilization and a 24.2-million-pixel Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor paired with Sony’s BIONZ X image processing engine, both of which power the Alpha 7 III. Sony is obsessed with making small cameras, and with the A7C the company has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new style of full-frame body design. At 124 x 71 x 60mm and 509g, the A7C is about the same size as the A7 III without its viewfinder housing, and 80% of the weight. In essence, the resulting Alpha 7C (for ‘compact’) places the 24.2MP sensor and core feature set from the popular Alpha 7 III into a flat-topped, rangefinder-style body that’s very similar to the APS-C-format Alpha 6000-series of cameras. Sony inevitably made some compromises to achieve the A7C’s compact size, and it certainly raised some eyebrows with the A7C’s £1900 launch price (body only) sitting higher than what the A7 III was then selling for. Even now, the camera retails for $1,598 / £1,699, which is about roughly equal to what the A7 III sells for. So the question becomes, is the smaller form factor worth those compromises? Is the A7C one of the best Sony cameras you can buy? The answer is: it’s complicated. Sony A7C: Firmware Sony has consistently updated the A7C with new firmware each year since its release, most recently in February 2023 to support new video editing and tagging software. Previous updates have added USB streaming functionality and compatibility with Sony’s Eye AF when filming video. You can download all of the latest firmware from Sony’s website . Sony A7C: Features In terms of its core imaging hardware, A7C boasts almost the same impressive spec list as its sibling. Its 24-million-pixel BSI-CMOS sensor offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-51,200, along with extended settings from ISO 50-204,800. It’s paired with the same Bionz X processor as used by the high-end Alpha 7R IV, which supports shooting at 10 frames per second with a 115-frame raw buffer, or 8fps with live view between frames. A new, smaller shutter unit provides a slightly slower top speed of 1/4000sec, but this can be extended to 1/8000sec by engaging silent mode. The hybrid autofocus system makes use of 693 phase-detection points and 425 contrast-detection points that are arranged across 93% of the frame. All of Sony’s class-leading AI-based autofocus technologies are on board, including Real-time Eye AF and Real-Time Tracking . Meanwhile the downsized IBIS unit promises 5 stops of stabilisation, just like the A7 III. One trade-off for the camera’s compact size is that it only includes a single SD card slot , in contrast to the dual slots found in most similarly priced full-frame models. Thankfully, it’s compatible with the high-speed UHS-II standard. Given the target audience, I don’t think the single slot is really a problem; after all, those who prefer the peace of mind offered by being able to back up images in-camera during an important shoot can still buy the A7 III. Video can be recorded in either 4K resolution at up to 30 fps, or Full HD up to 120fps. Both microphone and headphone sockets are built in, positioned so as not to block the screen when it’s set facing forwards for vlogging. Hybrid Log Gamma is available for displaying a wider range of tones on HDR TVs, along with S-log for those who like to colour grade their footage in post-production. However the camera can only output 8-bit colour, which limits its flexibility in this respect. Sony has included both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for connection to your
        smartphone via the free Imaging Edge Mobile app for Android and iOS. It’s particularly easy to copy images across to your phone, by pressing the Fn button during playback and then firing up the app. It’s also possible to connect your phone to the camera, browse through your images and copy them across, even when it’s switched off and stowed away in a bag. However, it’s unnecessarily complicated to set up the requisite always-on Bluetooth LE first time around, as you have to find and change multiple menu settings. Unfortunately there’s still no in-camera raw conversion for adjusting your images before sharing them, either, which is something all of the other leading brands have been offering for years. Remote control of shooting is available via a Wi-Fi connection, with a live view display and a decent array of settings available to change from the app. But inexplicably, you can’t specify the focus point, and instead have to let the camera decide for itself, which is a really fundamental flaw. This is compounded by the lack of any provision to use a wired shutter release, as it means the A7C lacks a properly functional remote control . This is a pretty serious oversight for a camera body at this price. Sony A7C: Focal points Sony has managed to fit a full-frame sensor into a small body, but has made serious compromises along the way. Sony FE 28-60mm F4-5.6 compact kit zoom To complement the A7C’s small body, Sony has produced the compact, retracting FE 28-60mm F4-5.6 kit lens. It measures 67mm in diameter and packs down to just 45mm long, while weighing in at a mere 167g. By full-frame standards, this makes for an unusually portable package, but it isn’t remotely pocketable. Unfortunately, the lens offers very limited creative potential. Its zoom range, minimum focus and maximum aperture are all mediocre, especially when you bear in mind that it drops to f/5 just past the 35mm mark. Regardless of whether you want to shoot sweeping landscapes, shallow depth-of-field portraits, or revealing close-ups, it’s equally unaccomplished. It does boast weather-proof construction, but from my experience, its exposed front element will just get covered in raindrops unless you source a 40.5mm hood. Ultimately, there’s little point in spending the money on a full frame system unless you actually gain the advantages that the larger sensor can offer – most obviously for low-light shooting and shallow depth of field. This lens delivers none of that. Personally I’d pair the A7C with small primes or f/4 zooms instead. This highlights an inconvenient truth around the concept of compact full-frame: you still need relatively large-aperture lenses to achieve most of the real-world photographic advantages that the sensor can provide over smaller formats. Sony Alpha 7C: Build and Handling The A7C may notionally be Sony’s entry-level full-frame model, but in terms of build quality it’s anything but low-end. The firm has used a monocoque design, with the main components fixed to the weather-sealed magnesium alloy shell, rather than an internal chassis. As a result, it’s a robust-feeling piece of kit. The camera is available in a sort-of-retro silver and black finish, as well as all black. Its stepped top-plate is an aesthetic improvement over the boxy A6000-series models, but while I suspect Sony is hoping to garner flattering comparisons with Leica, it reminds me more of Panasonic’s GX range. The firm’s obsession with downsizing has resulted in a handgrip that has clearly been designed to wrap around the NP-FZ100 battery as tightly as possible, which makes it rather small and cramped. There’s also just a minimal hook to stop your thumb from sliding off the back, while the dimpled rubberised covering is rather smooth. The grip still works OK, but the camera is certainly happiest with small lenses, and feels slightly unbalanced even with the firm’s FE 24-105mm F4 G OSS, which is far from the largest lens it makes. There’s no good reason why Sony couldn’t have used a larger grip, as it would make no practical difference to the overall bulk once a lens is mounted. Unsurprisingly, the most significant differences compared to the A7 III are to do with the design and control layout. Essentially the A7C is derived from Sony’s APS-C mirrorless bodies, which isn’t a good thing at all. It has relatively few physical controls , and tries too hard to shoehorn too many functions onto them. As a result, enthusiast photographers are likely to find it much more frustrating to use than its SLR-shaped siblings. The main settings are controlled using a pair of electronic dials on the camera’s back, one horizontal and one vertical, with the latter doubling up as a 4-way d-pad that gives direct access to ISO, drive mode and various image display modes. In a marked improvement over the A6100, though, these are now complemented by a dedicated exposure compensation dial. The movie button is also more conveniently placed on the top plate, and can be reassigned
        to control other functions in the stills-shooting modes. Compared to the A7 III, there’s neither a control dial on the handgrip under your index finger, nor an AF-area joystick. Instead Sony expects you to let its AI-based subject recognition take the strain, with a prominent AF-ON button on the back that’s used to specify and lock onto the subject. If you prefer to position the focus point manually, you have to press the button in the centre of the d-pad to change its mode, and then use the directional keys. Alternatively you can use the touchscreen to position the AF point. Either way, the net result is a camera that’s almost entirely operated using your right thumb. With the A7C designed to appeal to users stepping up to their first proper camera from a smartphone, it comes as a serious disappointment to find that Sony has failed to include the excellent touchscreen interface it developed for the recent Alpha 7S III. Instead, the touch interface is limited to specifying the focus area and magnifying the image in playback. This compounds the restricted physical controls, and means users who want to take manual control will spend a lot of time pressing the d-pad buttons. You also get Sony’s old, chaotic menu layout, rather than the much better organised one from the A7S III. It’s tempting to forgive the A7C’s poor handling as a trade-off for its size, but it really didn’t have to be this way. Other camera companies, including Canon, Fujifilm and Olympus, have shown that it’s possible to make even smaller cameras that work much better. It’s just a consequence of Sony’s decision to aim the camera at inexperienced photographers. Sony A7C: Viewfinder and screen It only takes one look through the A7C’s viewfinder to reveal the biggest compromise that Sony has made to achieve such a small body. It’s tiny, with the 2.36m-dot unit providing a meagre 0.59x magnification. This means it’s even smaller than the viewfinders found on entry-level APS-C or Micro Four Thirds models that cost a third of the price. The EVF also has a very small surround, which means it’s difficult to see in bright conditions. This is all compounded by the low quality of Sony’s standard live view feed, which is prone to jagged lines and false colour. I’d recommend changing the Display Quality setting in the menu to High, despite the fact that this will reduce battery life. Thankfully Sony’s new-found enthusiasm for fully articulated screens continues, with a 3in screen that can be set to almost any angle. This provides a significant advantage over the tilt-only unit on the A7 III for stills, in that it can be used to compose high- and low-angle shots when you rotate the camera to shoot in portrait format. If you feel so inclined, it can also face forwards for selfies and vlogging. It has a 3:2 aspect ratio, which means you get a usefully larger preview image compared to the 16:9 screens used on A6000-series bodies. As usual for mirrorless, Sony previews exposure and colour in the live view display. You also view at the shooting aperture, which effectively provides a full-time depth-of-field preview. Plenty of shooting information is available, including electronic levels and a live histogram. Annoyingly you can’t show these at the same time, but instead have to cycle though multiple display modes. Sony A7C: Autofocus One area in our Sony A7C review where it’s difficult to fault the camera lies with its autofocus. Sony has led the pack for several years in this regard, with its superb face- and eye-detection and subject tracking. If you spend a lot of time photographing people, these are hugely valuable features. Out of the box, the camera is set to both choose the focus area, and switch between continuous and single AF, automatically. However I found that the best way to use it was instead to combine AF-C mode with Flexible Spot, which allows you to position the focus area as you see fit. Then when you hold down the AF-ON button, the camera will lock on to the subject under your focus point and keep it in focus, even if it moves or you recompose the shot. This goes a long way to offsetting the lack of a joystick for positioning the focus point. When you’re using the LCD for composition, you can simply tap on the subject that should be in focus. Used this way, the A7C’s autofocus works extremely well . It’s incredibly good at locking on to the subject rapidly and decisively, and keeping it sharp. Its face and eye detection works brilliantly, although frustratingly you still have to switch in the menu between it recognising humans or animals, which means you have to decide on a shot-by-shot basis whether you prefer your family to your pets. This is one area Canon’s latest cameras, or even Sony’s own Xperia smartphones, work much better, as they’re able to understand both simultaneously. Sony Alpha 7C: Performance Operationally, the A7C is a snappy performer. It fires up practically instantly when you flick the power switch, whose convenient
        location encircling the shutter button also makes it easy to maximise the battery life, with Sony’s large NP-FZ100 providing excellent stamina. The camera reacts instantly to all the physical controls, but its touchscreen response is noticeably laggy. The camera’s metering and auto white balance systems are both quite competent, without being the best you’ll find. As usual with mirrorless cameras, the accurate preview display makes it easy to judge when you’d like to apply some exposure compensation or adjust the white balance. This is good news, as left to its own devices the camera has a tendency towards producing somewhat dull, bland colours in its JPEG output that can often be improved by selecting a preset or custom white balance. But if you’re after excellent JPEG colour stright out of the camera, you’d be better off with the likes of Canon or Fujifilm; the A7C invariably gives best results when processing from raw. On the other hand, the raw image quality is truly excellent. The 24MP sensor delivers more than enough detail to make large prints, and the dynamic range at low ISOs is immense , meaning that in high contrast situations you can exposure to retain highlights and pull up huge amounts of shadow detail in raw processing. High ISO image quality is also excellent, and I’d be perfectly happy shooting at ISO 12,800 as a matter of course, and even ISO 25,600 if necessary. Sony’s new compact IBIS system works fine, although it’s some way off being class-leading. For example, using the kit zoom at 35mm, I was able to get consistently sharp images with a shutter speed of 1/4 sec, and occasional usable images at 1/2 sec too. This is quite creditable, but it can’t match the best IBIS systems, which are now capable of stabilising hand-held exposures of a second or more. Continuous shooting performance is particularly impressive, with the A7C happily rattling off a burst of 115 raw frames, or 90 in raw + JPEG mode, before slowing down. What’s more, with a suitably pacey UHS-II card it’ll clear the buffer in less than 15 seconds. Coupled with the excellent AF, this kind of performance is easily good enough for fast-moving sports and action, and well beyond what the majority of photographers are likely to need. Sony A7C: ISO and noise With the same excellent image sensor as the A7 III, the A7C delivers raw image quality that’s easily a match for anything else in its class. It produces files that are free of visible noise up to ISO 1600 , with just a little luminance noise creeping in at ISO 3200. However, in our Sony A7C review we found that colour and detail both remain strong on increasing the sensitivity further, with even ISO 25,600 being perfectly usable, which is pretty impressive. At higher settings the quality quickly deteriorates, though, and while ISO 51,200 is usable at a push with careful noise reduction during raw processing, I’d steer well clear of the extended ISO 102,400 and ISO 204,800 options unless there were really no other choice. Below you can see 100% crops taken from our standard test scene to compare how the camera performs at different ISO settings.'

      value: 'DJI kindly sent me the DJI Pocket 2 , a pocket-sized portable camera capable of taking high quality photographs and video (64MP 1/1.7-inch sensor shoots up to 4K/60fps). Which is also available in two colours, Sunset White and Classic Black. DJI Pocket 2 at a glance: In my case, this piece of kit was extremely helpful for conducting quick video interviews with photographers at the Wildlife Photographer of the Year press event. Plus, it was more discreet to use than the bright white OM 5 gimbal . DJI Pocket 2 Audio With audio enhancement the Pocket 2 adjusts the audio recording to match the direction of your video recording and features audio zoom, meaning when the video zooms in so does the sound helping you to create a more dynamic recording. You can also choose from three different sound patterns, front, front and back or all built-in microphones activated. In the The additional DJI Pocket 2 Wireless Mic with Windscreen made recording interview audio easier in loud places and allowed audio to be picked up through the wireless microphone attached to the interviewee, rather than built-in microphones in the Pocket 2. DJI Pocket 2 Video However, as seen in the videos from the WPY event, such as this one , the Pocket 2 doesn’t perform well in low light conditions. Shooting multiple high quality videos in a short space of time also made the device heat up and stop filming, even with a full battery. The preview screen is very small, and fiddly but is a touchscreen, and you can tap to focus on subjects within the frame, and zoom in. Like the DJI OM 5 , the three-axis stabilised camera handled walking and movement well, without any shaking. Video when panning was also very smooth. But there is some bouncing motion with each step when walking, see the video below. I tested the ActiveTrack 3.0 feature at the Action stage at TPS, and found that if the subject is small or fast it won’t follow accurately and would even lose the subject altogether. The footage is also very grainy when zoomed in, but the sound quality is very good. The Pocket 2 performed better in brighter lighting conditions and outdoors. Like the OM 5, you can connect the Pocket 2 to the DJI Mimo app and also use your phone to view footage, adjust focus and take the shot. It also has a great battery life, and you can adjust exposure, white balance and other ‘Pro’ settings. Using the button on the handle of the Pocket 2, in three clicks the camera is flipped around to film yourself. Which is great for vlogging especially with the Face Track feature keeping the gimbal on you, this works much better than trying to track the moving subject you are filming – until you turn your head and the camera loses your face. A countdown is also available for timed photos. The Pocket 2 I was sent also came with the Creator Combo, which included the basic bundle accessories of the Mini Control Stick, Wrist Strap, Pocket 2 Cover, smartphone adaptors and 1/4-inch tripod mount. Plus a Do-It-All Handle, Micro Tripod, Wide-Angle Lens, Wireless Microphone and Windscreen in addition.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: We’re a good few months down from the Fujifilm X-T5’s release now, and this is a camera that has bedded in beautifully. Pivoting back to photography and splitting off the range with separate hybrid models has proven to be an excellent decision, engendering good will from both the photo and video camps. It’s often said that that there’s no such thing as a perfect camera, but let’s just consider what the Fujifilm X-T5 offers. Firstly, it’s uniquely enjoyable to shoot with, thanks to its analogue controls, excellent viewfinder, and 3-way tilting screen. Secondly, it delivers superb image quality, with stacks of resolution if you need it, plenty of dynamic range, good high-ISO performance and effective image stabilisation. Plus, of course, that lovely Fujifilm colour rendition. Fujifilm’s X system also offers plenty of lens choice, especially now third-party makers are getting in on the act. There’s a good mix of high-end zooms and smaller, more travel-friendly options. I’ve been using the X-T5 with the firm’s 10-24mm f/4, 16-80mm f/4, and 70-300mm f/4-5.6 zooms, which together give a fully weather-sealed setup covering a 15-450mm equivalent range, while weighing in at less than 2kg. You simply can’t match that with any full-frame system. If you want bokeh, pick up a fast prime or two, such as the XF 56mm f/1.2 R WR or one of the many fine f/1.4 primes available. You really should be able to assemble a lens set that suits your needs. For lens suggestions check out our Best Fujifilm X-mount lenses in 2023 . When I was casting around for a list of cons, it really felt like nitpicking, and the few I could dredge up are minor. The biggest practical issue, arguably, is handling those 40MP files. If you really need a deeper raw buffer, better handling with large lenses, or more advanced video features, spend an extra $300/£180 and get the Fujifilm X-H2. However, the X-T5’s attraction really shines through when you start looking around for alternatives. Its closest competitor comes from the same stable, but while the X-H2 may offer more to video shooters, it lacks the X-T5’s sheer charm. Elsewhere in APS-C mirrorless, only Canon’s EOS R7 comes close to the resolution, but it’s difficult to recommend due to the extreme paucity of matched RF-S lenses. You could perhaps buy a full-frame camera for the same price, but it’ll be old and under-specified in comparison, and not as nice to use. Indeed to match the X-T5’s resolution and all-round spec, you’re looking at much more expensive models such as the Canon EOS R5, Nikon Z 7II, Panasonic S1R or Sony Alpha 7R IV, not to mention a pricey lens set to match them. Ultimately, nothing else on the market can quite match the all-round package that the Fujifilm X-T5 offers enthusiast photographers at the price. If you’re not tied down to an irrational fixation with 36x24mm, it’s pretty much perfect.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Fujifilm X-T5 is one of the best cameras ever made for people who like to take photos. That may sound like a bit of a silly tautology, but these days with increasing focus on video, most new cameras are designed to be jacks of two trades. The best Fujifilm cameras have always been a bit of a breed apart though – while they do shoot video, and do so very well, their retro designs, emphasis on physical control dial and film-like picture profiles have always attracted those who prefer capturing a single still frame to a moving one. Fujifilm X-T5 at a glance: Fujifilm got the message; the firm’s USA arm even released a good-natured ad poking fun at itself for the misstep . While the X-T5 does shoot very good video – 6.2K 30p, albeit with a crop – the focus is very much clearly back on photography, with the return of the much-loved three-way tilting rear screen, among other things. Fujifilm has the hybrid photo/video Fujifilm X-H2 in its stable, meaning X-T5 fans can get back to doing what they love: taking pictures. The X-T5 and X-H2 share the same sensor – a 40.2MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS 5 HR sensor that’s a considerable jump on the previous generation. The high-end camera market that has been increasingly dominated by full-frame mirrorless in recent years, with the continuing expansion of series like Canon EOS R, Nikon Z and Panasonic Lumix S. Fujifilm, meanwhile, is nailing its colours firmly to the APS-C mast, determined to demonstrate that crop-sensor cameras can compete in the big leagues, and in fact may have a few advantages of their own. At $1,699/£1,699 body-only, the Fujifilm X-T5 is a good deal more affordable than most full-frame rivals (only the cheapest full-frame mirrorless cameras come close). It’s got sophisticated subject-detection autofocus, and the same powerful pixel-shift high-res mode from the X-H2, which captures 20 shots to create a 160MP composite image. It can fire off burst images at 20fps with a 1.29x crop, or 15fps at full-res. But there’s more to it than spec. One of the reasons Fujifilm cameras are so beloved by their community is that they are pleasurable cameras to use. The X-T5 is a more attractive camera than anything made by Sony, with better ergonomics too. Plus, the selection of the best X-mount lenses is the finest you can get for any APS-C mirrorless system, blowing the meagre offerings for Canon and Nikon’s crop-sensor cameras out of the water. The Fujifilm X-T5 is quite simply a brilliant and charming camera, offering amazing value for money and providing a compelling argument to ditch full-frame entirely. Let’s dig into its features and put it to he test to find out why. Fujifilm X-T5: Features Let’s examine the X-T5’s photographic features in detail. Its 40.2MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS 5 HR sensor features a back-illuminated design and employs Fujifilm’s proprietary X-Trans colour filter array, which aims to reduce image sampling artefacts compared to conventional Bayer sensors. It provides a standard sensitivity range of ISO 125-12,800, which is expandable to ISO 64-51,200. Also inherited from the X-H2 is the autofocus system, which employs 3.3 million on-sensor phase detection pixels that cover almost the entire frame. With the firm’s latest X-Processor 5 on board, the X-T5 also boasts AI subject detection, which can recognise and focus specifically on animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, airplanes and trains. Of course, the camera can also recognise human faces and eyes. Continuous shooting is available at 15 frames per second using the mechanical shutter, or 20fps using the electronic shutter with a 1.29x crop (which gives 24MP images). The electronic shutter also offers super-fast shutter speeds up to 1/180,000sec. One concession to the X-T5’s lower price, though, is a smaller buffer compared to the X-H2: as few as 19 frames when shooting 40MP uncompressed raw files. In the unlikely event that the sensor’s native resolution is insufficient, there’s now a 160MP pixel-shift multi-shot mode. The camera must be mounted on a tripod – there’s no hand-held option – and will shoot no fewer than 20 raw files, with the sensor shifted fractionally between them by the IS unit. The high-res composite image isn’t generated in camera, but instead has to be assembled on a computer. Other updates over the X-T4 include Fujifilm’s latest 5-axis in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) system, which is now rated for up to 7 stops of shake reduction. The viewfinder is slightly larger too, offering 0.8x magnification, compared to 0.75x. The battery life rating is improved to 740 shots per charge, compared to 600 previously, which the firm credits to the new processor. One thing that doesn’t change is Fujifilm’s excellent in-camera colour processing, with 19 Film Simulation modes onboard offering a wide range of attractive looks. Files can now be recorded in the 10-bit HEIF format, which in principle should offer better quality than conventional JPEGs. But as yet, this is somewhat negated
        by the fact that HEIF has rather limited software support. Connectivity options are much as we’d expect, with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi included. You can connect the camera to your smartphone via the free Fujifilm Camera Remote app, and then copy images across for sharing on social media. You can also use your phone as either a simple remote shutter release via Bluetooth, or with a live view feed and extensive control over camera settings over Wi-Fi. One minor quirk with the X-T5 is that you can’t change the exposure mode from the app – instead it’s defined by how the camera’s control dials are set. Fujifilm X-T5 Video features Unsurprisingly, one area where the X-T5 lags its hybrid sibling comes with regards to video recording. However, it still gains plenty of advances over the X-T4. It’s capable of recording in 6.2K resolution at 30fps, with 4:2:2 10-bit colour and a 1.23x crop. 4K HQ output is also available at 30fps via 6.2K over-sampling with the same crop, while standard-quality 4K can be output at 60fps from the full sensor width. Fujifilm’s F-log2 profile is onboard, and capable of recording 13+ stops of dynamic range for colour grading in post-production. What’s more, both ProRes and BlackMagic RAW can be output over HDMI in 6.2K resolution. A 3.5mm stereo microphone socket is built in, while headphones can be attached to the USB-C port via an adapter. Fujifilm X-T5: key features Fujifilm X-T5: Build and handling Perhaps the key attraction of Fujifilm’s ‘traditional’ X-T line is its analogue operation, with top-plate dials for shutter speed, ISO and exposure compensation complemented by aperture rings on the firm’s XF lenses. This makes for a uniquely engaging shooting experience that you don’t quite get anywhere else. And while previously, the cameras have grown slightly larger with each generation, the X-T5 has slimmed back down again, with its dimensions much closer to those of the original X-T1, at 129.5x91x63.8mm. In your hand, the body feels impressively robust, with a magnesium alloy shell and weatherproof construction. Fujifilm has pulled off the impressive trick of making a relatively small camera that looks like it doesn’t have much of a handgrip, to reinforce its retro credentials, but which actually provides a secure and substantial hold. However, the X-H2 would still be a better choice for those who’ll be shooting regularly with large telephoto lenses. What’s particularly striking when you start shooting with the X-T5 is the way it gives direct access to so many key functions. Along with those dials on top, there’s a drive mode switch underneath the ISO dial, whose detailed settings are tweaked using a function button on the front. Then to control autofocus, you get a focus mode switch on the front, and a joystick on the back to position your focus area. Some photographers will be sad to see that the switch beneath the shutter speed dial selects between still and movie modes, rather than reverting to metering mode like on the X-T3. But you can still access metering from the ‘up’ key of the d-pad, so it’s not a huge loss. Meanwhile the left and right keys are assigned to film simulation and white balance modes, while the down key cycles through the camera’s various boost modes that optimise the live view feed for different shooting scenarios. It’s good that this feature is so accessible – on most cameras it’s hidden away in the menus. Last but not least, the Q button on the camera’s shoulder brings up an onscreen quick menu with 16 further functions, including the settings for the subject detection AF. This Q menu can be customised to suit your personal preferences, as can many of the button functions. There’s also a custom My Menu where you can group your most-used settings from the main menu. While I really enjoyed shooting with the X-T5, sometimes those top-plate ISO and shutter speed dials can be awkward to adjust, as they require you to move your hands away from a shooting grip. But in another stroke of genius, by setting them to their C and T positions respectively, you can pass their functions to the electronic front and rear dials instead. So if, on occasion, you want the camera to behave more like a conventional DSLR, it’ll do that too. One consequence of the X-T5’s design is that you can’t save custom shooting setups in quite the same way as you can with most other cameras, including the X-H2. Instead, the exposure, focus and drive modes are always defined by the dial positions. However, you can still save all other groups of settings as custom memories for specific purposes such as portraits or action, and then recall them quickly with a single tap of the Q menu. Fujifilm X-T5: Viewfinder and screen Despite having a smaller body than its predecessor, the X-T5’s electronic viewfinder offers a slightly larger view, with 3.69 million dots and 0.8x magnification. While this lags behind the X-H2’s 5.76m-dot unit, it’s still a very fine viewfinder that offers a large, bright
        and clear view. It’s complemented by a 3in, 1.84m-dot rear LCD, which sees the very welcome return of Fujifilm’s 3-way tilt mechanism. This is perfect for photographers who wish to be able to shoot at high or low angles in both portrait and landscape formats, but don’t need a forward-facing option for self-shooting. More video-focused shooters will, however, be better served by the X-H2 with its vari-angle screen. Fujifilm previews white balance and colour processing by default, along with exposure compensation across a +/- 3-stop range. A half-press of the shutter button stops the lens down to the taking aperture, previewing depth of field. Compositional aids include a choice of gridlines and two types of electronic level, while for estimating exposure there’s a choice of luminance or RGB live histograms. Fujifilm’s Natural Live View option is also available, which aims to mimic the experience of shooting with an optical viewfinder, with reduced saturation and brightened shadows. This can be particularly handy when you’re shooting in high-contrast situations, and I’d consider assigning it to a function button (I use the View Mode button) on the viewfinder housing. Overall, the X-T5 gives an excellent viewing experience that’s probably better than anything else you can get at the price point. Fujifilm X-T5: Autofocus In terms of autofocus, the X-T5 uses essentially the same system as the X-H2. When selecting a focus point manually, you get a choice of using either 117 or 425 AF points spread across the frame. Alternatively, you can enable face or eye detection, and specify whether the camera should focus on your subject’s left or right eye. Fujifilm users have had these options for years, but now you also get subject recognition, where the camera will detect and specifically focus on trains, planes, motorbikes, cars, birds, or animals. What’s more, as they get larger and clearer within the frame, it understands which specific part of the subject it should focus on. The way Fujifilm implements subject detection takes a little getting used to. First of all, it’s a separate setting from face detection, and enabling one disables the other. Secondly, it interacts with your AF area selection setting in a fashion that’s perhaps not immediately obvious. Using the auto AF area selection mode, which uses all of the camera’s focus points, the camera will generally pick whichever potential subject is largest and nearest. However, if you’re using single point or zone focusing, it’ll prioritise a subject close to the specified focus area. So if there are multiple possible targets within the scene, in principle you can select between them using the joystick. This could be useful when there are several possible subjects to choose between, but isn’t as quick as other brands that let you use the joystick to select directly between outlined subjects. Like most cameras, though, you have to pre-select which subject type you’re interested in via the Q menu. So if you have animal mode selected and then point the camera at a bird, the subject detection system will ignore it. You can set a function button to turn subject detection on or off, but not to choose between the various options, which feels like a missed opportunity. Once you’ve got the hang of how the X-T5’s AF system operates, though, you’ll find that it’s generally very reliable. With relatively large, predictably moving subjects such as cars and trains, I got near-a 100% hit-rate even with the relatively affordable Fujifilm XF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 R LM OIS WR lens. However, it’s not quite as good at keeping up with more difficult subjects such as birds in flight. In particular, it’s probably not as ‘sticky’ as the best systems for tracking fast, erratically moving subjects, and I found it could get distracted by something briefly passing in front of the subject, or sometimes drop focus onto the background. As a result, the X-T5 may not be the very best choice for demanding sports and wildlife shooters. But in the grand scheme of things, it still does a fine job. Fujifilm X-T5: Performance When you take the X-T5 out and set to work, you’ll quickly find that it’s extremely pleasant to use. Not only do you get all those alluring dials, it’s also extremely quick and responsive. If you prefer not to draw attention to yourself while shooting, the mechanical shutter is extremely quiet; switch to the electronic shutter, and the camera can be completely silent. The metering system is extremely reliable, meaning that you normally only need to use exposure compensation for aesthetic effect, and as is Fujifilm’s way, auto white balance is practically flawless. None of this would matter if the image quality didn’t measure up, but the good news is that it’s very impressive indeed, in both JPEG and raw. In fact, the output quality is simply stunning; you get stacks of resolution from that 40MP sensor, along with plenty of dynamic range at low ISO. You can expect to be able to lift
        three or maybe even four stops of shadow detail before noise becomes particularly troublesome; this isn’t as much as the very best full-frame sensors, but it’s plenty for most real-world purposes. I was also perfectly happy shooting at sensitivities up to ISO 12,800 (the idea that higher pixel count sensors give worse high-ISO images is essentially a myth these days). Then there’s those lovely Fujifilm colours. If you want to grab a shot from the camera and show it off on social media with no additional editing, no brand is better for giving seriously attractive output. I tend to gravitate towards the Velvia / Vivid mode for landscape-type shots, and Astia / Soft for everyday shooting. There’s a case to be made that you don’t necessarily even need to shoot raw much of the time, unless you’re making significant tonal adjustments. If there’s one area of concern about the X-T5’s performance, it would be the raw buffer, which is as few as 19 frames in full-resolution uncompressed raw, equating to a little over a second’s full-speed shooting. One solution is to switch to recording compressed raw files only, which at least doubles the buffer depth, but requires a trip into the menus. You can also get greatly increased bursts by combining compressed raw with the electronic shutter 24MP crop mode and dropping the frame rate; in fact at 10fps, you’re limited only by card space. I saved this combination of settings, along with subject detection and AF tracking, as a Custom Setting memory. In my hands, Fujifilm’s in-body stabilisation worked as well as most other brands, giving reasonably sharp hand-held exposures at shutter speeds as long as 1 second towards the wide end of the XF 16-80mm f/4 R OIS WR zoom. This is only really surpassed by Micro Four Thirds cameras from Olympus/OM System and Panasonic. The main question is how much blur you’re willing to accept – you might see some obvious camera shake when examining 40MP images close-up onscreen, but still have a picture that’s entirely usable for many purposes. Clearly, some Fujifilm users might be concerned about whether their existing lenses will be sharp enough for the 40MP sensor, especially after the firm released a list of those required to get the most from it. But my advice would be not to worry about it. You’ll never get worse results from any given lens with a higher resolution sensor; instead, it’s just a question of whether the extra detail you record is fully proportional to the increased pixel count. If you’re happy with the lenses you’ve got, they’ll still work fine on the X-T5. And that 40MP resolution gives so much scope for cropping if you need it. The X-T5 may not match the X-H2’s 8K recording, but there’s more than enough on offer here for photographers who’d like to be able to shoot high quality video occasionally. The quality of its footage is very good, aided again by those lovely Fujifilm colours. Fujifilm’s IBIS provides a good degree of stabilisation, allowing you to shoot hand-held and pan smoothly across a scene without the footage becoming unwatchable. If the X-T5 still isn’t up to your needs, there’s always the X-H2 and X-H2S. High-res multi-shot mode One feature that isn’t really practical is the pixel-shift multi-shot mode. Not only does it chew up vast amounts of card space, with each sequence occupying the best part of a gigabyte, it’s also a pain to assemble the composite files on a computer. More often than not, Fujifilm’s Pixel Shift Combiner program then flags up that it’s detected an error, and if you examine the resultant 160MP files, they’ll be beset by artefacts such as jagged diagonals. As a result, they end up looking no more detailed than the 40MP single-shot image. Alternatively, you can output 40MP files with full-colour sampling at each pixel location, which works somewhat better. But even then, anything that moves between the 20 frames will be rendered as a pixelated mess. Below you can see crops comparing the three options. The full-colour sampling mode gives visibly increased detail, but the 160MP image contrives to look no better than 40MP single-shot mode, even when downsampled to the same size. While there’s clearly slightly sharper detail in the 40MP full-colour sampling version, things go very badly wrong if anything moves between the frames. Unlike Olympus/OM System, Panasonic and Sony, Fujifilm doesn’t yet offer motion detection and compensation. Let’s look at what happens with the sea and a passing walker. Overall, I’m just not convinced this is worth the hassle and card space. It’s certainly nowhere near as practical as Olympus/OM System and Panasonic’s implementations, which are both very usable. Then again, it’s not as if you need more than 40MP very often, anyway. Fujifilm X-T5: ISO and noise Thanks to its 40MP sensor, the X-T5 is capable of recording noticeably more detail than most full-frame cameras, indeed you’ll need to spend a lot more money to get anything that fares appreciably better. Fine
        detail is maintained impressively well up to ISO 1600, but then deteriorates progressively; however to my mind, images are still entirely usable all the way up to the top standard setting of ISO 12,800. I would though, as is usually the case, steer clear of the extended settings; ISO 25,600 might be OK when there’s no alternative, but ISO 51,200 doesn’t look good at all, with little fine detail and heavily crushed blacks.

      value: The mirrorless Nikon Z5 is a cheap, entry-level full-frame camera, but three years on from release, isn't it time we got an update?
    - type: conclusion
      value: Nikon has become a major player in the full frame mirrorless market since entering it in 2018. The original Z6 and Z7 collected numerous accolades from its critics and have gone down a storm with photographers worldwide so it’s not surprising to see Nikon taking the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ approach to designing its third Z-series model. Touted as an entry-level model, the Z5 is much more advanced than this basic classification suggests. It’s alike to the Z6 and Z6 II in terms of its build quality and handling, but by making a few alternations such as equipping it with a CMOS sensor, removing the top plate display and employing a lower-resolution screen, Nikon has been able to make it cheaper. Other things like the fact it accepts a pair of SD cards rather than a single costly XQD card and that it’s available as part of a bundle with a 24-50mm kit lens will appeal to photographers who feel like they’re ready to advance to full-frame. The bigger point, perhaps, is the price. There’s now a substantial cost difference between the Z5 and the next model up in the range the Z6 II. What’s more, current prices make the Z5 highly competitive against the Canon EOS RP (cheaper, but older and not as good) and the Panasonic Lumix S5 – excellent video capabilities but now succeeded by the Lumix S5 II . A more contemporary rival is something like the Canon EOS R8 . While it’s a bit more expensive, this camera benefits from up-to-date features like deep-learning autofocus that can recognise and track subjects using sophisticated AI. It has a broader ISO range and a more sophisticated video spec, though the Z5 fires back with dual card slots and a much nicer viewfinder. Weighing up the pros and cons of the two makes for a tricky decision, and the older camera does better than you might expect. What about Sony? Well, the decision to jack up the price of the A7 IV means the Z5’s closer rival is probably still the A7 III , which is similarly priced in the UK at £1,499, and a lot more expensive in the US at $1,998. The Z5 has much nicer ergonomics, while the A7 III is far superior when it comes to autofocus, particularly with Sony’s famous Eye AF. Again, a close one to call; with no obvious winner, it’s mostly down to personal preference. Still, it’s easy to get lost in the weeds of comparing cameras. Taken on its own terms, the Nikon Z5 remains a remarkably capable and reliable full-frame camera that has a quality feel, a solid set of specifications and a price point that adds further to its appeal, especially to current Nikon owners looking to upgrade. What’s more, it’s an affordable entry point into the Nikon Z ecosystem as a whole, and a steadily expanding range of rather good lenses. We’re looking forward to seeing what its successor can do, but in the meantime, the Nikon Z5 remains an excellent choice of full-frame mirrorless camera.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Nikon Z5 is Nikon’s cheapest full frame mirrorless camera . Designed as an entry-point for those who want to upgrade to the larger sensor size, the Z5 looks a lot like its premium cousins in the series, the high-resolution Nikon Z7 II and the all-rounder Z6 II . However, it’s a little stripped-down compared to those cameras and their predecessors, with a 24.3MP full-frame CMOS sensor that isn’t backside-illuminated. It’s missing a top LCD plate, and a glance at the specs below may give you the feeling that some of its specs are a little pedestrian. Just 4.5fps burst shooting? A crop on 4K video? However, the Nikon Z5 has a lot of things going for it. The camera is fully weather-sealed, for one, and boasts a sophisticated 5-axis in-body image stabilisation system. Its sensor can reach ISO 51,200 natively, and its 3,680k-dot OLED electronic viewfinder (inherited from the original Z6) is a thing of beauty. And then of course there’s the price; it’s affordable for a full frame mirrorless camera , with a price well below $2000 / £2000, even with a decent lens thrown in. Nikon Z5 at a glance: The Nikon Z5 was released in 2020, an entry-level full-framer going up against the likes of the Canon EOS RP , Sony A7 III and the Panasonic Lumix S5 . All well and good, but the thing is, time has a way of marching on. Nowadays the Canon EOS RP’s price has dropped thanks to the arrival of the similar Canon EOS R8 . Sony has taken the wraps off its A7 IV , and Panasonic received many accolades for the shiny new Lumix S5 II (and Lumix S5 IIX , for that matter). And as for the Nikon Z5? Well, it’s hanging in there still. Normal camera timelines would indicate that we’re due a Z5 II in the not-too-distant future, but as yet, there are no signs. So, while the Nikon Z5 hasn’t changed in the past three years, the world around it has. Not all of these changes are bad news for the prospective Z5 buyer; after all, the range of Nikon Z-Mount lenses has continued to expand, with useful mid-priced all-rounders like the Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR and spectacular premium primes like the Z 85mm f/1.2 S . The Nikon Z5 was released two years into Nikon’s mirrorless journey. We’re now five years in. Is this entry-level full-frame mirrorless model worth buying, or would you be better off either waiting for a sequel, or picking up one of its updated rivals? Let’s find out and dive straight into our full Nikon Z5 test and review. Nikon Z5 Features By the time 2020 rolled around, Nikon had developed in a short space of time an extensive range of Nikkor Z lenses, but in order to target the Z5 at new users perhaps on a tighter budget, Nikon needed to release it with an affordable kit zoom. The kit lenses on full frame cameras are typically quite large, too, so perhaps this 2x kit zoom was also designed to convince buyers that full frame camera kits can be compact. The Z 24-50mm f/4-6.3, which can be purchased with the Z5 or separately, is a no frills lens with a fairly restrictive focal length, yet it’s lightweight and has a retractable zoom mechanism to keep it as compact as possible when space is limited. Like the Z6 II and Z7 II, the Z5 shares the same large-diameter, short back-focus lens mount that has a flange distance of 16mm from lens to sensor. To keep Nikon DSLR holdouts happy, the Z5 can be paired and used with F mount (FX) lenses via Nikon’s FTZ adapter, and a subsequent firmware update has made the Z5 compatible with Nikon’s newer FTZ II version. Though the pixel count is similar to the Z6 II, the Z5’s sensor is different. The Z5’s 24.3-million-pixel sensor is a standard CMOS chip, whereas the Z6’s has a back-illuminated structure, which should see it deliver a slightly better performance in low light – something I’ll touch on in more detail later. The chip features an anti-aliasing filter like the Z6 and shoots across the same native ISO sensitivity range of ISO 100-51,200, however it doesn’t permit shooting as high as ISO 204,800. Enter the extended ISO settings and you’ll find it shoots between ISO 50-102,400 . Given that it uses the same EXPEED 6 image processor as the original Z6 and handles similar data throughput, you could be mistaken for thinking it rattles out a consecutive burst of shots as quickly, but this isn’t the case. Whereas the Z6 can fire off a burst at a brisk 12fps (14fps for the Z6 II), the Z5 shoots a continuous burst at a rather more pedestrian 4.5fps. The silent shooting mode is invaluable for times when you’d like to shoot inconspicuously and automatically engages the electronic shutter. Unlike some mirrorless cameras , though, you can’t set the shutter speed beyond its maximum of 1/8000sec. One peculiarity that we observed on the original Z6 and Z7, whereby the highest shutter speed is restricted when using the electronic first-curtain option, is the same on the Z5. While it’s handy having the option of enabling the electronic first-curtain to eradicate blurring caused by shutter shock, you’ll need
        to disable if you’d like to shoot faster than 1/2000sec. To counteract shaky handheld movements, the Z5 inherits the same 5-axis in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) system first seen on the Z6 and Z7. This is great to see on a camera at this level and gives it an advantage over rivals that rely entirely on optical stabilisation built into the lens – Canon’s EOS RP being one such example. The IBIS system lets users shoot sharp shots up to 5 stops slower than would otherwise be possible. Compared to the usual pitch and yaw correction that’s provided by in-lens optical stabilisation, IBIS additionally corrects for rotation around the lens axis, which helps when shooting hand-held video or attempting shots using slow shutter speeds. In addition, it corrects left-right and up-down movements, which can have a significant impact when shooting subjects and details from close distances. Pairing the Z5 with an F-mount (FX) lens with vibration reduction (VR) built-in, with Nikon’s FTZ adapter sees the in-body and in-lens systems work together. Pitch and yaw is corrected by the lens, with IBIS compensating for rotation around the lens axis. The Z5’s hybrid autofocus system is similar to the Z6 II’s. It arranges 273 phase detection AF points across 90% of the frame area and you get the option to select every other point for faster AF point repositioning across the frame. The detection range isn’t as extensive as the Z6 II’s though. It covers -3EV to 19EV when low-light mode is enabled from the autofocus custom setting menu and -2EV to +19EV when it’s turned off. Elsewhere, users get a fine selection of AF-area modes, including single-point AF, the choice of two wide-area AF modes (large and small) and an auto AF mode that ties in with face detection and subject tracking. High-resolution video is available in 4K (UHD) resolution at up to 30p , but unlike the Z6 II that records 4K (UHD) footage using the full width of the sensor, the Z5 enforces a 1.7x crop . This means you’re unable to shoot 4K video wider than 41mm using the 24-50mm kit lens, which might not be wide enough for some, and even with a wide-angle lens like the Z 14-30mm f/4 S, the widest you can shoot at is 24mm. Switching the resolution to Full HD 1080p lets you record movies without a crop at frame rates up to 60p, but again the Z6 II has an advantage here in the way it’s better suited to slow motion recording with frame rates up to 120fps. Microphone and headphone sockets are provided and are located one above the other to the side of the Z5’s HDMI, USB-C and remote ports. The Z5 accepts Nikon’s latest EN-EL15c rechargeable battery. It is compatible with older EN-EL15 batteries too, but users won’t get the same number of shots per charge (470 using the LCD and 390 shots with the EVF) as they will with the EN-EL15c. USB power delivery is also provided . This serves as a useful way of topping up the battery between shooting, with the option to power the Z5 when it’s turned on during operation. The alternative to this is to buy the MB-N10 battery grip, which was originally made for the Z6 but also fits the Z5. It accepts two batteries and increases battery life closer to 1000 shots, which should suffice for an average day’s shooting. Nikon Z5 Focal points Here we take a quick look at a few of the Z5’s other features we’re yet to touch on. Nikon Z5 Build and Handling So-called ‘entry-level’ cameras get a bit of a bad reputation when it comes to build quality. By using cheaper materials, manufacturers can cut costs in production and offer their cameras for considerably less than top-of-the-line models. The good news is that Nikon hasn’t cut any corners whatsoever with the Z5. My first impression handling the camera out of the box was that the build quality upholds a similar feel and same level of robustness as the original Z6 and Z7. Despite its positioning at the lower-end of the Z-series, it’s weather sealed like its peers , helping to protect dust and moisture penetrating through to the internals. Anyone who shoots regularly in the portrait orientation or would like to increase shooting stamina will appreciate that the MB-N10 battery grip provides the same level of dust-and drip-resistance as the body. It’s hard to spot many differences compared to the Z6 II and Z7 II when the Z5 is viewed directly from the front. It has a similar deep rubberised grip, pair of customisable function buttons around the perimeter of its lens mount and flash of red beside the front command dial that’s long been associated with Nikon’s interchangeable lens cameras. The dimensions of the body are virtually identical, with the biggest difference on top plate being the position of the mode dial, which replaces a top plate display. Photographers who like glancing down at a top plate display to check settings before they shoot will find themselves referring to the informative information display on the screen instead. This can be adjusted to display as dark on light or light or
        dark from the setup menu depending on user preference. The mode dial doesn’t require you to hold a centre button to rotate it and positively locates at each mode setting. Meanwhile, the positioning of the movie-rec, ISO and exposure compensation buttons are unchanged. They’re conveniently positioned behind the shutter button that’s surrounded by the On/Off switch for intuitive start-up with your index finger. After the criticisms Nikon received for releasing the Z6 and Z7 with a single XQD card slot, it’s good to see the Z5 equipped with not one, but two SD card slots , both of which support UHS-II memory cards. The role played by slot 2, which is staggered slightly below Slot 1 can be set to overflow, backup or to record JPEGs when raw files are being recorded to Slot 1. The option to records stills to one card and video to the other is absent, however it’s good to see Nikon listening to customer feedback and providing an essential backup facility on a camera of the Z5’s entry-level positioning. At the rear the Z5’s layout of buttons and controls is a carbon copy of the Z6 and Z7 . This will be well received by anyone contemplating the Z5 as a backup body and means you can transition between all of Nikon’s full-frame mirrorless models seamlessly without giving operation a second thought. You get all the dedicated buttons you need, including an excellent ‘i’ button that can be customised to instantly pull up your most frequently used settings. Drive modes are loaded using a dedicated button below the menu button and you get a joystick that falls naturally under your thumb for shifting the focus point around the frame. Its knurled texture also helps distinguish it from the AF-ON button above when the viewfinder is lifted to your eye. Much like we said when we reviewed the Z6 and Z7, the Z5 provides a sensational handling experience that makes it comfortable to hold and operate with smaller and larger lenses alike. It’s hard to think of a way that Nikon could improve the handling characteristics of the camera. With its weather sealing, metal chassis and high quality construction, the Z5 is much more robustly made than its entry-level status implies. Nikon Z5 Viewfinder and screen Another likeness between the Z5 and Nikon’s Z6 and Z7 models is the electronic viewfinder it uses. The Z5’s 0.5in, 3.6-million-dot EVF with 0.8x magnification doesn’t match the resolution offered by some of the 5.76-million-dot electronic viewfinders we’ve tested of late, yet it’s a good example that faithfully displays exposure adjustments, white balance and colour in the preview image. As well as providing an accurate preview of how aperture affects depth of field and a high level of sharpness in both normal viewing and at magnified settings, it’s ideal for reviewing images when bright sunlight plays havoc with reflections on the rear screen. Like the rear screen, the brightness and colour balance of the viewfinder can be manually adjusted from the setup menu, however I found no reason to deviate away from their default settings during my testing. The EVF has a refresh rate of 60fps and switches between monitor and viewfinder displays quickly when the camera is raised or pulled away from the eye. The latter can be changed from the monitor mode selection button if you’d prefer to only use the EVF or screen rather than let it adjust automatically. Complementing the viewfinder is a 3.2in touch sensitive screen that can be tilted down by 45° for overhead shots and upwards by 90° to aid with low-level shooting. What it doesn’t allow you to do is pull it out to the side to aid with portrait shooting from awkward angles, which rivals such as the Canon EOS RP and Panasonic Lumix S5 present an advantage. The resolution of the screen (1,040k-dot) is lower than the 2.1-million dot resolution you get on the more expensive Nikon Z models, but I only noticed a difference when comparing the Z5’s screen alongside the others at maximum magnification. It displays a clear and detailed preview in Live View and playback modes and the sensitivity of the touch panel can’t be faulted either. It lets you navigate your way through the main menu precisely with very light taps and isn’t affected by rain droplets on its surface. Autofocus The Z5 put in an admirable focusing performance on test. It’s quick to lock on to near and far subjects, with its red AF target turning to green when correct focus is achieved. Something I did identify during use though is that it is quite easy to lose track of the AF point on the rear screen when the AF area mode is set to pinpoint AF or single-point AF and you’re working in bright conditions outdoors. I put this down to the boundary lines of the AF target being fairly thin. To reacquaint myself with its position I found myself nudging the AF point around the frame on a few occasions. The AF target can be shifted diagonally across the frame as well as up/down and left/right. With all the AF points active it takes 2.3secs
        to shift the AF point from one side of the frame to the other compared to 1.6secs when every other point is selected. The Nikon Z6 II makes the better choice for photographers who regularly shoot high-speed action or sports with its ability to shoot 7.5fps faster, but it’s good to see the Z5’s focusing keeping apace with speedy subjects and offering a continuous focusing performance that’s on a par with its high end Z-series cousins. Face and eye detection is useful when shooting portraits, though this is one of the few things that cannot be added to a function button and has to be accessed via the autofocus settings from the custom setting menu. Users get the option to select which eye they’d like the camera to focus on from a flick of the joystick and it’s the same when the camera is set to animal detection. Owners of cats and dogs who enjoy photographing their loved pets should take advantage of animal detection, however Nikon still isn’t as advanced as Sony in offering eye detection when recording movies, which is disabled when you enter video mode. Nikon Z5 Performance The Z5 behaves like the Z6 II and Z7 II in the way it’s quick to start up and responds instantaneously to button presses, turning of dials and adjustments that are made using the touchscreen. There wasn’t any time during use where the camera interrupted my shooting, or prevented me capturing the shots I wanted. Nikon DSLR users tempted by the Z5 as an upgrade to their existing camera will immediately feel at home navigating the menu. It’s easy to relate to and everything is laid out similarly from the photo shooting menu through to the setup and retouch menus. For those not familiar with Nikon, the Z5 isn’t a daunting camera to pick up and use. The Auto mode returns good results in the hands of novices who’d like to simply point and shoot with minimal user input and there is everything you could want at your fingertips to take manual control as your ability and experience grows. The Z5’s matrix metering rarely misjudges scenes and exposes well for dim and bright conditions alike. There were only a few cases where I opted to dial down the exposure by -0.7EV in order to preserve highlight detail. If you find the camera is producing results that are a touch too cool for your liking in bright sunlight conditions it’s likely the camera’s white balance is set to the Auto A0 setting. The Auto A1 and Auto A2 settings are intended to keep the overall atmosphere of the scene and preserve warm lighting colours respectively, but if like me you mainly shoot outdoors you may prefer to use Natural light auto, which tends to depict colour accurately. Loaded with a pair of 64GB SDXC UHS-II memory cards facilitating 280MB/s read and 250MB/s write speeds, the Z5 showed it’s capable of recording just shy of 100 raw files in its continuous high (4.5fps) shooting mode before its buffer needed a breather. If you’d like to shoot at a slower speed there are several options. The burst speed can be set to shoot between 1fps and 4fps from the continuous low drive mode. Shooting raw and JPEG (Fine) at 4.5fps saw the Z5 record 99 frames before the limit of its buffer was reached. I expected it to shoot for longer with the image quality set to JPEG (Fine) only, but again the buffer had to be given a few seconds to clear after 99 frames before more could be taken. Pairing the Nikon Z5 with a mobile device and setting it up to automatically ping images across via Bluetooth is as straightforward as it gets and entirely reliable. This will be a relief to Nikon users who’ve previously struggled with Nikon’s early SnapBridge efforts. It’ll even continue to send images across one by one after the camera is switched off and it took around 20 seconds between firing the shutter and the image appearing in the app and the camera roll. To select specific images you’d like to download, or to remotely control the camera directly from the app you’ll be prompted to enable the camera’s Wi-Fi. In remote mode you get a live view display that can be viewed in the portrait or landscape orientation, with options to adjust exposure variables and move the focus point. The app is fairly basic and one thing to note is that there’s a momentary delay between pressing the shutter button and the picture being taken meaning it won’t be ideal for all types of shooting scenarios. It’s also highly recommended to select the auto download 2MP option to preserve memory on your mobile device if your plan is to upload images to social media platforms such as Instagram. Testing the Z5 with a variety of Z-mount lenses , including the Nikkor Z 70-200mm f2.8 VR S, showed that the IBIS system does a commendable job of counteracting shake associated with handheld photography. It plays an important role in ruling out jittery handheld movements when shooting video from stationary positions too and I was impressed by how well it compensated for shake when zooming and panning. With the Z 70-200mm f2.8 VR S I managed
        a high hit rate of sharp handheld shots as slow as 1/10sec at 200mm. With the 24-50mm kit lens, which isn’t stabilised, I was able to shoot sharp shots at the wide end as slow as 1/2sec and 1/5sec at 50mm. Users get the choice of three image sizes when the Z5’s image area is set to FX. As well as the Large (24.2MP) setting, there are Medium (13.6MP), and Small (6MP) options to choose from. Switching the image area over to DX applies a 1.5x crop of the sensor and can be used to get closer to distant subjects, albeit at reduced resolution. This came in handy at a game of cricket, where I used the DX crop mode with the Z 70-200mm f2.8 VR S and captured 10.3MP images at up to 300mm. Medium (5.6MP) and Small (2.6MP) image sizes are also available in DX mode. Intrigued to find out if there’s any difference between the images the Z5 outputs from its 24.3MP CMOS sensor and those from the Z6’s backside illuminated (BSI) 24.5MP sensor, I conducted several comparison shots using the same lens and settings before examining them side-by-side. Though the cameras resolve nigh on identical levels of detail at low sensitivity settings, low-light testing between ISO 6400 to ISO 102,400 revealed the back-illuminated structure of the Z6’s sensor exhibits slightly less digital noise in its images at high ISO, which allows more light to be collected at pixel level by shifting metal wiring behind the light receiving surface. This was most apparent when comparing dark shadowed regions of the same scene at 100% magnification. To be critical and having scrutinised both cameras ISO performances meticulously, I’d say the Z6’s low-light performance offers a one-stop improvement over the Z5. With regard to dynamic range , the Z5’s sensor provides respectable leverage at lower sensitivity settings when it comes to lifting dark shadowed regions or underexposed areas without introducing intolerable levels of noise. While the Z6 does pip the Z5 in terms of its low-light performance, the Z5’s image quality will serve aspiring photographers and those transitioning from APS-C to full-frame very well indeed. ISO and noise Studying our diorama results that were taken through the ISO range in a controlled shooting environment tells us that users of the Z5 can expect lovely clean, noise-free images between ISO 100 and ISO 800 when shooting in raw. Push beyond to ISO 1600 and ISO 3200 and you’ll notice noise appears, however it can be remedied by applying a small amount of noise reduction during post processing. ISO 6400 and ISO 12,800 are useable, but you’ll notice fine detail starts to be encumbered by increased noise in the latter. While I’d be prepared to shoot up to ISO 25,600 at a push on the Z6, I’d consider ISO 12,800 to be the upper limit I’d be willing to shoot at on the Z5. With there being a green tinge and reduction in colour saturation at ISO 51,200 and ISO 102,400 (Hi1.0), I’d recommend users avoid these settings at all costs. As for the automated noise reduction that’s applied to the Z5’s JPEGs, it’s what I’d describe as fairly aggressive and does smooth out fine textures and details beyond ISO 800. With this in mind, it’s preferable to reduce the high ISO noise reduction from normal to low.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The re-introduction of the OM-1 name was a perfect choice, a brilliant tribute to the 50th anniversary of the original OM-1. The new name dramatically simplifies the long-winded and often confusing naming system found on previous Olympus cameras. However, this is tinged with a bitter-sweet sorrow, as this is the last camera to bear the Olympus branding, and the official name of the camera is OM System OM-1. This was borne out with the introduction of the OM-System OM-5, on which the Olympus branding was nowhere to be seen. While that camera provides a compelling alternative to the OM-1, being both cheaper and more portable for travel, it’s clear that the OM-1 is still very much the flagship of the range, and it’s comprehensively more powerful across the board. If you enjoy shooting with Olympus cameras, then the refinements made with the OM-1, along with the improved image quality, features, and improved video options, makes this camera a real joy to use, with the updated menu systems another welcome change. The camera also resolves the complaints we made about the E-M1 III, with a new high-resolution viewfinder that looks fantastic, improved screen, improved menus, and the vertical grip now has a joystick. There’s also improved battery life, dramatically improved AF, and a noticeable improvement in image quality. For fans of smaller mirrorless camera systems, the OM-1 offers a really compelling option, particularly when you factor in the range of compact Micro Four Thirds lenses available for it. There will be those that want a full-frame sensor, but by sticking with Micro Four Thirds, OMDS has been able to create a relatively compact, weather-sealed camera system, with a vast choice of matching size lenses. They’re also able to use this to their advantage, with an ultra-high-speed sensor. Yes, full-frame mirrorless cameras are also quite compact, but are the lenses? And if you want high-speed, you’re looking at a significantly larger, and more expensive system. The price has gone up, which makes it £400 more expensive than the E-M1 III was when it was released, but many other cameras have also increased in price, as fewer cameras are being sold. For those that need or want 120fps continuous shooting (at 20MP), or 50fps with continuous-AF, this camera really does offer some unique features, including Pro Capture, particularly when you consider the weight savings to be found, and the price difference between this and other high-speed cameras such as the Sony A1, Canon R3, and Nikon Z9. The OM-1 weighs in at around 985g with the 12-40mm F2.8 II lens, and the 40-150mm f2.8 with 1.4x TC weighs 1010g, giving a total weight of under 2Kg. The improvement in weather-sealing gives this camera real appeal when you want a camera system that can be used in all kinds of weather, rather than being left at home, as long as you pair the camera with the appropriate splashproof lens.

      value: 'When the OM-System ‘Olympus’ OM-1 first arrived, no one quite knew to expect. The sale of the Olympus imaging vision to OM Digital Solutions in 2021 had left the future of the brand in an uncertain place, and while the purchasing corporation had pledged to keep the spirit of Olympus alive, corporations say a lot of things. Would this new line be able to match the quality of the best Olympus cameras ? However, doubts were assuaged when the OM-System ‘Olympus’ OM-1 arrived. Even from the name, it was clear how much respect the makers had for the Olympus legacy. There’s the obvious hat-tip to the legendary Olympus OM-1 film SLR, one of the most popular and important 35mm cameras in history (in a lovely touch, this camera was also released to coincide with the original OM-1’s 50th anniversary). But the name also calls to mind more recent models like the Olympus OM-D E-M1 III , to which this camera can be seen as a natural successor. That’s not to say that OM-System simply slapped its own name on an old camera body and called it a day. The OM-1 arrived sporting a 20MP Stacked BSI Live MOS sensor with a completely new design. The body also got an overhaul, with a refreshed high-resolution OLED EVF and vari-angle touch-screen, and the menu system was completely reworked. The updated sensor features a stacked design, and this combined with the new processor enables some truly impressive headline features. The OM-1 can burst shoot at an absolutely blistering 120fps with fixed AF, and manages a still-respectable 50fps with continuous AF. We’ll get more into the camera’s full feature set throughout the review. The new post-Olympus range has continued to expand with the OM-System OM-5 , a smaller and cheaper alternative to the OM-1 and successor to the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III . This camera showed that OM-System and the OM-1 weren’t a one-hit wonder; our editor concluded at the end of his OM-System OM-5 field test that it was more or less the perfect travel camera. So, you’ve probably gathered that we’ve been pretty impressed with OM-System, and the OM-1 in particular. However, more than a year out from its release and with successors in the pipeline, does it still do enough to justify its price tag? Which kinds of shooters is it suited to, and which ones should perhaps look elsewhere? These are the questions we’ll tackle as we get into our full OM-System ‘Olympus’ OM-1 review… At a glance The OM-1 arrived on the m arket in February 2022, sporting a completely new ‘ Quad Pixel AF ’ system, with 1053 cross-type AF points covering the entire sensor. This system supports continuous shooting speeds up to 50fps with Continuous AF , when using a compatible Olympus PRO lens. “Quad pixel AF” divides the pixel (photodiode) into 4 subpixels underneath the colour filter, and should not be confused with a Quad Bayer filter – it is NOT a Quad Bayer sensor. AI detection AF has been improved upon from the Olympus OM-D E-M1X , the company’s previous flagship, and now supports planes, trains, motor vehicles, birds, and animals such as cats and dogs, with both subject and face/eye detection, and this is said to be three times faster than the E-M1X. Focus is sensitive down to -5.5 EV, and you can choose whether to have a small focus point, all the way up to the full frame, with multiple sizes and areas in-between. You can also customise the focus area, with 4 different custom groups available. In-body Image Stabilisation (IBIS) has long been a feature of Olympus cameras, and the OM-1 continues the tradition. Using its 5-axis Sync IS with a compatible lens will give up to 8 stops of correction. When using a non-sync lens, you can expect up to 7 stops of IS. Beyond this, the camera also adds 1 step better rolling compensation, as well as improved panning compensation. There’s a new “Handheld assist” to support handheld long exposure shooting, which also works with Live Composite and Live Bulb. Computational photography – the camera includes a whole new menu section dedicated to this. This is where you’ll find High-res shot, Live ND, Focus stacking, HDR, multiple exposure, plus Live composite / time / bulb mode options. These last three settings can be quickly accessed using the B setting on the mode dial. Key points: OM System OM-1 Features The new high-res OLED EVF, with 5.76m-dots , offers the same resolution as premium models such as the far more expensive Canon EOS R3 , and Leica SL2-S , and a higher resolution than the Nikon Z9 (which sits at 3.69m dots). Magnification is 1.65x (0.825x) same as E-M1X, or 1.48x (0.74x) selectable, with the same optical quality as the E-M1X, and a 120fps refresh rate. There’s an anti-fogging coating for shooting in wet conditions, and a 0.005 sec display delay. The High-Res Shot mode gives 80/50MP images , and is easier to access using the movie button in photo mode. OMDS evidently wants to make it easier to use this feature without the need for a tripod, with handheld hi-res giving 50MP images.
        Using the high-res shot mode also gives 2 steps better noise performance due to multiple images being combined, and images are combined automatically in-camera. Video recording has been improved to include Cine 4K at 60fps from 5K oversampling, with 4:2:2 10bit (H.265 codec) internal recording, and FullHD at up to 240fps (cropped). For the more advanced filmmaker, there’s also support for C4K, 60p, 4:4:4, 12-bit external recording using Apple ProRes RAW with Atomos Ninja V support. Unlimited video recording is also possible, only limited by battery life. The camera features a completely redesigned menu system , that is now neatly colour coded, and browsable with the front and rear command wheels, or the 4-way controller. Unfortunately, they are not selectable using the touch-screen. However, the Super Control Panel (SCP) is touch-sensitive for most options. Greyed out items that are not selectable are explained with a pop-up explaining why, and you can also get information on each option by pressing the Info button. There’s also a MyMenu section so that you can get quick access to your favourites. It’s also worth noting that the OM-1 is the only camera in the range currently to benefit from these menus. The OM-5, for whatever reason, reverted to the older style of Olympus menus, which take some time to get used to. In terms of simple useability, this makes the OM-1 the best camera across the Olympus/OM-System stable. High-speed shooting – Continuous shooting buffer size: Pro Capture lets you capture 70 pre-shot images, double that of the E-M1 III and E-M1X. Shutter life is rated to 400,000 shots (when using the mechanical shutter), and we expect an unlimited number of shots can be taken when using the electronic shutter. The IP53 rating is an improvement over the IPX1 rating of the E-M1 III, and the camera is dustproof, splashproof, and freezeproof with a lightweight magnesium alloy body. To benefit from the IP53 rating you need to ensure you use compatible lenses. It almost goes without saying, that the camera features Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth built-in for remote connections and control with your smartphone or tablet. You can also use the camera as a very high quality webcam if you want, using Olympus’s free webcam software. Some of the differences between the OM-1 vs E-M1 III / E-M1X OM System ‘Olympus’ OM-1 Design and handling The OM-1 will look familiar to anyone who has used E-M1 cameras, but there are a few subtle changes that are designed to make the camera easier to use, including a new AF-ON button on the back of the camera, a smaller function lever (switches between AF and MF), as well as redesigned command dials at the front and back. The shutter release button is now separate to the command wheel, and the hand grip gives an excellent feel, helping the camera feel great in the hand. The controls are all neatly positioned to make them easy to reach, and you have direct access to the most important settings, with dedicated ISO, Exposure compensation, and AF-ON buttons. There’s a dedicated video record button, and the majority of buttons and controls can be customised to your own personal preferences. The ISO button also doubles as image rating button in playback, so you can quickly give images a star rating out of 5. The camera body has a solid metal construction, and with multiple seals it offers improved weather-sealing than other Olympus cameras, being the first to offer an IP53 rating being both dust and splashproof when used with specific PRO lenses. The camera is ever so slightly larger than the E-M1 III, at 134.8 x 91.6 x 72.7mm, and weight is slightly increased, at 599g with battery and memory card (excluding eyecup). The battery compartment is found underneath, and features a metal latch that locks firmly into place. You can see there are good levels of weather sealing, and it’s possible to open the battery compartment even when using a relatively large tripod plate. The new battery, model BLX-1, has a rating of 2280mAh (7.2V), which is an improvement over the 1720mAh (BLH-1) battery used in the E-M1 III. Using the Quick sleep mode is said to double battery life, and the new, optional HLD-10 battery grip can also double battery life. Viewfinder and Screen The electronic viewfinder (EVF) looks great, with a high-resolution OLED display at 5.76m-dots. It gives a very clear view, and the optics used are also of high quality, giving you a sharp view right into the corners. Icons and text are clearly displayed, and you can access the menus and Super Control Panel if needed to change settings. You get the choice of 0.83x magnification, filling the frame, or 0.74x if 0.83x is too large. The optics have an anti-fogging coating, to help with visibility when using it in inclement weather, and there’s a 120fps / 0.005s refresh rate. You’ll also find that you can shoot at 120 or 50fps without blackout, and this really is useful when you want to ensure you’re still capturing the subject, and the AF-tracking
        is doing its job (at 50fps). A simulated OVF (optical viewfinder) view is available, or S-OVF, and this is designed to give you a view more similar to using an optical viewfinder. A new “Night Vision” option has been added to support astrophotography, and this is designed to work with the “Starry Sky AF” setting. There’s a 3inch 1.62m-dot touch-screen , which is fully articulating, and can be tilted out to face forwards, great for selfies, vlogging, and other things. The view is very clear, and colours look great, matching the viewfinder. The screen also has good viewing angles, and it’s also bright enough outdoors, with adjustable brightness levels. The microphone socket can be used without the screen bumping into it, due to a higher position. Some of the icons appear a little bit small at times on the rear screen, and this would benefit from an update, even making the icons just a little bit larger would help. For example, the multi-shot high-res shooting mode is shown with a small icon, as is the AF AI detection mode selected. OM-1 Autofocus With the AF-ON button on the back, the camera can be used in the same way as other cameras with this, and for those that love to use ‘back-button focus’ this will be a real bonus. You can customise the AF area, and whilst there are numerous areas already setup, you can customise and setup four different, additional focus areas. AF settings can be quickly accessed with one of the many dedicated AF buttons, and pressing the top left AF/metering button gives you access to metering options, as well as AF modes including: S-AF, C-AF, MF, C-AF + Tracking, Preset MF, and Starry Sky AF. AI subject detection gives you the choice of motorsports (cars, motorcycles), airplanes (including helicopters), trains (of all types), birds, and animals – specifically cats and dogs. When you’re not focusing on these subjects, then the camera will also focus on humans, with face and eye detection AF, which is extremely rapid. Subject detection requires you to choose the subject before shooting, however this can be set to a custom function button to make it quicker to switch subjects. Using this you can see the camera quickly track the subject, as well as the main area also highlighted with a smaller box, for example the head/face and eyes of a subject, even when the subject is looking away. It’s worthwhile customising a button for this, or adding it to the MyMenu section, as it can take a while to find this option otherwise, as it doesn’t appear to be accessible on the Super Control Panel (perhaps a firmware update will add this). Starry Sky AF – This AF options works well to help you capture photos of stars at night, with the camera focusing correctly on the distant stars. There’s an option to automatically create timelapse videos in-camera that you could use in conjunction with this, with a wealth of settings (including 4K, FullHD video output). You also get to set the interval time from 1 second, up to 24hrs, 59m, 59seconds, and can take up to 9999 shots! OM System ‘Olympus’ OM-1 Performance Image quality and detail is excellent, particularly at lower ISO speeds, with a noticeable improvement to be found in the levels of detail visible in images. In fact, depending on your subject, you may want to reduce the sharpness slightly particularly with portraits, depending on the lens you use. The new OM System M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm F2.8 II PRO lens gives excellent images, with rapid focus and extremely sharp results. It’s been updated to improve image quality and weather-resistance, as well as having a new fluorine coating. The lens performs extremely well, and has an impressively close focus distance. Colour is, as you would expect with an ‘Olympus’ camera, very pleasing, Olympus cameras have always given great colour reproduction, thanks to an excellent auto white balance system. There are multiple picture modes (or profiles) to choose from, and you can customise the sharpness, contrast, saturation, and gradation of each to your own personal preferences, if needed, and I’m only saying ‘if needed’ as for the most part you won’t need to as the camera gives excellent results straight from the camera. Image stabilisation performance – The image stabilisation system is excellent, though by default the camera will also tend to raise the ISO and shutter speeds in low light, so if you’re happy to use the IS system more, rather than rely on higher ISO/shutter speeds, then it’s worth adjusting the settings. Then you should be able to get sharp shots at much slower shutter speeds than you would with other camera systems, giving you the benefit of lower noise (and cleaner detail) in images, assuming you’re not shooting moving subjects. High-res 50MP/80MP modes – In the normal photo modes, holding the movie record button and turning the rear dial lets you switch on the high-res mode, as well as switch between handheld and tripod modes. The camera combines multiple shots in camera, producing a higher
        resolution image, with 50MP images possible handheld, and 80MP images when using a tripod. Processing speeds have been improved, taking roughly 5 seconds, meaning you can more quickly move on to your next shot. The results possible are impressive, with additional detail visible thanks to a higher resolution image, however, any movement in the scene, such as trees blowing in the wind may degrade the image quality in these areas. Pro Capture – Shooting at 120fps is all well and good, if you like shooting lots of shots and hoping you captured the right thing, however, your reaction times need to be really good if something unexpected happens. That’s where Pro Capture comes in, letting you capture up to 70 shots before you fully press the shutter release button. This makes it a really useful feature, as you can be more confident of getting the action, and can often shoot less, rather than other cameras, where you have to start shooting, and hope the action happens while your camera still has enough buffer to store all the shots without slowing down. Like the other high-speed shooting options, you can shoot at 120fps (ProCap SH1) with fixed AF/AE, or at upto 50fps (ProCap SH2) with C-AF/AE tracking with the right lens. You’ll need to ensure light levels are good though, as the shutter speed needed for this is 1/640s. ISO and Noise Performance The camera has made improvements in noise performance, with both a BSI CMOS sensor (BSI CMOS sensors give improved noise performance compared to CMOS sensors), and the camera also adds a new AI algorithm for noise reduction. These images are crops from JPEGs straight from the camera, and you can click them to view the full-size versions. OMDS says the standard range of the OM-1 is ISO200 to ISO25600, with ISO80, and ISO100 being extended (low) settings, and above ISO25600 being extended (high) settings, going all the way up to ISO102400. This is a noticeable improvement over the standard range of ISO200 to ISO6400 on the E-M1 III. While ISO6400 felt like the limit on the E-M1 III, we’d say that using ISO12800 and ISO25600 on the OM-1 produces improved results. Whilst ISO25600 on the Olympus PEN E-P7 showed image quality drop off noticeably, the OM-1 delivers better results, with JPEG images looking good, albeit with an obvious drop in detail as the ISO speed increases. Whether you’ll want to shoot at these higher ISO speeds will be up to you, and of course, processing the raw files, you can adjust the noise reduction settings to suit. Images show excellent detail, particularly fine detail at lower ISO speeds, particularly when using a high-quality lens like the 12-40mm f2.8 PRO lens, however, with a base ISO speed of ISO200, the extended speeds of ISO80 and ISO100 do show a reduced dynamic range. It’s nice to see a Micro Four Thirds camera offering a competitive ISO range, making it more competitive with APS-C cameras. You can also process raw images in-camera, to adjust the noise reduction options (Off, Low, Standard, High), or use Olympus Workspace, which has been updated to include an AI Noise reduction tool. The raw .ORF files are also supported in the latest version of Adobe Camera Raw. However, one area where this camera lags behind is in resolution, with a 20MP sensor, it simply doesn’t match other cameras that offer 24/36/42/45/50MP sensors. Yes, you can use the high-res modes for still subjects, but not everyone wants to shoot still subjects. No doubt, if this camera did offer a higher resolution sensor, we’d have a more limited ISO range, and mostly likely be complaining about noise performance, so ultimately it’s good to see an extended ISO range, even if it does mean we have a 20MP sensor. It’s interesting that Panasonic has introduced a new 25MP MFT sensor for the Lumix GH6. Will this make it across to the OM System range one day? We will have to wait and see. Video performance Unlimited 4K 60fps video is available, with options for CINE 4K or UHD, with AF including face/eye detection. High-speed FullHD video can be recorded at speeds upto 240fps (8-bit), or 200fps (10-bit), albeit without sound, and S-AF (pre-record) / MF. OM-Log400, Flat and HLG video picture mode profiles are included, as well as the same colour profiles as the photo mode, however options are limited depending on H.264/H.265 selection, with photo profile, Flat and OM-Log400 available with H.264 (8-bit), and OM-Log400 and HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) available with H.265 (10-bit). View Assist is available and displays a standard BT.709 colour gamut onscreen. Audio is recorded at 16-bit, 48KHz, or 24-bit, 96KHz, with options for wind noise reduction, volume limiter, plus separate levels for internal / external mic, along with settings for plug-in power, and headphone volume settings. H.264 video has a maximum bitrate of 202mbps, and H.265, with more efficient compression has a maximum bitrate of 152mbps. Detail in video footage is good, and the camera’s IBIS gives impressive stability that can
        give your video the look a camera mounted on a gimbal. There are microphone and headphone sockets as you’d expect, as well as PD (Power Delivery) over USB Type-C. However, one thing that will most likely disappoint videographers is the micro HDMI connection, which is not as secure as full size HDMI. Zebra display with two levels is available, plus a red frame around the screen when recording. Value for money Competitors to the OM-1 include the following APS-C and Micro Four Thirds models: There’s also the Panasonic Lumix G9 , Olympus OM-D E-M1 III , and E-M1X which all offer 60fps continuous shooting. Full-frame models with a similar price point include: However, it’s extremely difficult to find other cameras that offer such high-speed continuous shooting as the OM-1, without increasing the price massively, with the closest being the far more expensive Nikon Z9 , which offers 120fps continuous shooting at 11MP, or 30fps at 47MP.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Canon’s first premium full-frame mirrorless camera was a long time in the making. The EOS R5 probably arrived two years later than many would have liked, and Canon needed to pull out all the stops if it was to be successful at delivering what serious photographers and loyal users have been patiently waiting for. As a stills camera, the EOS R5 is phenomenally impressive. The sensor and highly effective IBIS system deliver images of exquisite quality. It’s one of the finest mirrorless cameras to roll off Canon’s production line and though it is expensive, you get a dependable, hardwearing and wonderfully intuitive camera in return that overcomes the criticisms associated with the early EOS R. The combination of a multi-controller, dual card slots and a rear thumb dial is what EOS 5D-series owners expect from a camera they might well upgrade to. Video shooters might find it overheats when filming lengthy 8K and 4K 120p video clips, but Canon openly admits this and hasn’t tried to sweep it under the rug. If you’re not one for shooting video, overheating is not a concern. Photographers who buy the EOS R5 will be smitten with it. It does get through its battery power fairly quickly, but it’s incredibly versatile, capable of churning out superb high-resolution landscape shots as it is capturing high-speed action sequences at a blistering 20fps with continuous AF. It’s an ideal candidate for portrait, wedding and documentary photographers too with its improved face/eye detection, and anyone who insists on a higher resolution output than the EOS R6. I fell in love with using the EOS R5, but dropping $3,699 / £4,149 on a camera body is hard to justify. Add two or three L-series RF-mount lenses to it and the price you’ll pay soars close to, or above, the £10k mark! It’s perhaps no wonder then that its sibling, the EOS R6 and the more recent R6 Mark II have been so well received by the masses, especially when you consider how much they retain from the EOS R5 for considerably less money. Ultimately the EOS R5 was extremely close to picking up our highly acclaimed Gold Award, but falls just short of doing so. It’s a remarkably accomplished stills camera, but the fact that it’s susceptible to overheating when shooting high-resolution video, along with its high price, means that it just misses out picking up a maximum 5-star rating.

      value: 'Canon EOS R5: at a glance Canon entered the full-frame mirrorless market in 2018 with the EOS R which was based around an entirely new RF lens mount. Sadly, the EOS R wasn’t without its shortcomings and it was followed in 2019 by the entry-level Canon EOS RP . Both cameras are still available to buy new from Canon’s offical on-line shop. Both the R and RP proved to be capable cameras but, as far as serious enthusiasts and professionals were concerned, they lagged behind their rivals, notably from Sony. Canon had to up its game, and fast, if it wanted to keep up in the full-frame mirrorless race. What was needed was a camera with better ergonomics and one that could exploit the full potential of the company’s superb RF-mount lenses. The answer came in mid-2020 in the form of the EOS R5, a top-end model with a feature set that had appeal to demanding stills and video photographers. It launched at $3,899 / £4,199 body only. Three years on, and with an EOS R5 Mark II probably not due until well into 2024, the EOS R5’s price has held up well at $3,800 / £4,149; shop around for the latest offer. Canon EOS R5: Features The EOS R5 sits above the EOS R6 that was announced at the same time, and its replacement the Canon EOS R6 Mark II announced in November 2022. It was the third EOS R series camera to be built around Canon’s RF lens mount that has a 54mm internal diameter, 20mm flange distance and 12-pin data connection. Directly behind this mount lies a 45-million-pixel full-frame Dual Pixel CMOS sensor that had never been used in a Canon camera before. It employs an optical low-pass filter to suppress moiré and aliasing artefacts, and by pairing it with Canon’s latest DIGIC X image processor, users get an ISO range of 100-51,200 (expandable to 50-102,400). We’ll touch on the EOS R5’s video specification shortly, but for now let’s focus on its impressive stills capabilities. High among these is its ability to shoot 45MP files at a staggering 20fps in silence with full AE and AF tracking using its electronic shutter. Switch over to the mechanical shutter and the EOS R5 rattles out a burst at a brisk 12fps, which is faster than its Sony Alpha 7R IV and Nikon Z 7 rivals. It has a deep buffer to handle the high volumes of data, and records to a CFexpress B card that allows maximum transfer speeds of up to 1.97GB per second and up to 180 uncompressed Raw files to be recorded continuously at 20fps. A second UHS-II compatible SD card slot is added for backup purposes, or separating still images and video between cards. A breakthrough on the EOS R5 was the introduction of in-body image stabilisation (IBIS), which was lacking on both the EOS R and EOS RP. Canon claims up to 8 stops effectiveness when paired with certain RF mount lenses such as the RF 24-70mm f/2.8L and RF 28-70mm f/2L. In instances where the EOS R5 is used with Canon lenses that feature optical image stabilisation (IS), the lens corrects yaw and pitch while the body compensates for roll around the lens axis along with vertical and lateral movements. The EOS R5’s autofocus system can focus down to an impressive -6EV in low-light, enabling it to focus with maximum apertures as small as f/22, while also allowing teleconverters to be used with relatively small-aperture lenses, and compact super telephoto lenses like the RF 600mm f/11 IS STM and RF 800mm f/11 IS STM. Focus acquisition occurs as fast as 0.05sec, there are 5,940 selectable AF points covering 98% of the image area, and Canon’s powerful subject recognition and deep-learning AI technology is inherited from the EOS-1D X Mark III. In the case of the latter, at launch it was programmed to recognize and track humans, cats, dogs and birds, but this was been extended with a firmware update to include vehicles (racing cars or motor bikes) as well. Face and eye detection has also been improved to recognise faces more accurately. Along with the usual predefined Servo AF case sensitivity settings, which allow users adjust the focus tracking sensitivity and acceleration/deceleration tracking, the EOS R5 introduces a Case A (Auto) setting that’s intelligent enough to automatically select one of the four subject-specific AF cases in response to changes in subject movement. The EOS R5’s video spec is remarkable on paper. It’s the first mirrorless camera capable of recording DCI 8K (8192×4320 pixel) or UHD 8K (7680×4320) raw video internally using the full width of the sensor at up to 30fps. The high data throughput demands that a CFexpress card is used when shooting in 8K (unless you use IPB compression) and there is the option to grab 35.4MP JPEG still images at the same time. There’s a plethora of bit depth and compression options in the video menu, including broadcast quality 4:2:2 10-bit output and Canon Log to produce footage with extra-wide dynamic range and generous exposure latitude for easy colour grading in post production. Meanwhile 4K video is available in DCI (4096×2160) and UHD (3840×2160)
        resolutions at frame rates up to 120p for silky-smooth slow-motion capture. At frame rates up to 60fps, there is a choice between recording 4K video using the full width of the camera’s sensor or a 1.6x crop. Video users who demand the highest quality 4K footage may also want to use the 4K HQ mode that reproduces exquisite detail at frame rates up to 30p by oversampling 8K footage. If that wasn’t enough, the EOS R5 supports Full HD video at up to 120p. Detailed information about heat build-up and how this limits record time is clearly outlined on Canon’s website. However, since its launch the EOS R5 has enjoyed several firmware updates and in v1.60 longer video recording times were possible with the Auto Power Off Temperature option. Selecting High means the camera will not automatically shut-down when it gets warm, depending on the conditions. The latest firmware is v1.8.1, which brings a High Resolution shot mode to the EOS R5. In terms of connectivity, the EOS R5 includes Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. With the Canon Camera Connect app for Android or iOS, you can use your smartphone as either a Bluetooth wireless release, or a comprehensive Wi-Fi remote control complete with a live view feed and the ability to change a wide range of settings. If you’d prefer to plug in a wired release, the EOS R5 is equipped with an N3-type remote release connector at the front, plus it has an infrared remote receiver on the handgrip. Canon EOS R5: Focal points Here we take a look at some other exciting features we’re yet to mention. Time Lapse: The EOS R5 allows users to capture high-resolution time-lapses in 8K and 4K resolutions, with the movie being created in camera. The time between each frame can be specified, and it’s also possible to determine if exposure is locked at the start of the sequence or re-metered for every shot. Focusing aids: The EOS R5 offers tools to help you nail critical sharpness when focusing manually. Focus peaking highlights the edges of in-focus objects with a colour of your choosing, while Dual Pixel Focus Guide uses a graphical indicator to display whether the subject is front/back focused and turns green when correct focus is achieved. FTP: Professional photographers who want to deliver photos directly to clients quickly and securely from their current location can do so using the camera’sbuilt-in Wi-Fi. FTP settings can be configured in-camera or off-line using EOS Utility software, and up to 10 presets can be saved for instant recall. Dual Pixel Raw: As well as being able to take control of image micro adjustment, bokeh shift and reduce flare and ghosting using Canon’s Digital Photo Professional (DPP) software, the appearance of lighting on the faces of people in portraits and the clarity of hazy backgrounds can now be adjusted in-camera when dual pixel raw mode is activated. Battery compatibility: The EOS R5 can be used with the older type of LP-E6 and LP-E6N batteries, however it’s worth noting the very fastest shooting speeds and in-camera charging is not available when using the LP-E6 battery. Fv mode: Canon’s Flexible-priority AE mode is similar to Program AE mode. The difference is it allows you to take instant control of ISO, shutter speed, aperture and exposure compensation when required. The rear dial toggles between these variables and the top dial adjusts the setting. Settings that are underlined indicate that the camera is controlling them automatically. Interface: At the side there is a USB 3.1 connector that can be used to charge the new LP-E6NH battery, which is rated for 320 shots using the EVF, or 490 with the LCD. Beside this is an HDMI micro out (Type D) interface. A PC-sync flash port is also provided. High Resolution Shot mode: This feature came with firmware v1.8.1. This uses the camera’s IBIS system to produce pictures of static scenes with a higher resolution. The camera makes nine separate exposures, with the sensor moving slightly between each shot, and the shots are merged in-camera to give a 400MP equivalent JPEG. Sadly, you don’t get the individual files to play with afterwards, so there’s still room for Canon to refine the feature further. Canon EOS R5: IBIS effectiveness At launch there were ten Canon RF lenses that gained between 6.5 and 8 stops of stabilisation and of course more lenses have been added since then; as of mid 2023 there are 18 primes and 14 RF lenses. The RF 24-70mm f/2.8L IS USM, RF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM, RF 24-105mm f/4-7.1 IS STM, Canon RF 28-70mm f/2L USM and RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM, all benefit from a maximum of 8 stops of image stabilisation. Meanwhile the RF 15-35mm f/2.8L IS USM, RF 35mm f/1.8 IS USM and RF 50mm f/1.2L USM benefit from 7 stops of image stabilisation. Pair the RF 24-240mm f/4-6.3 IS USM or RF 100-500mm f/4.5-7.1L IS USM with the EOS R5 and you’ll get 6.5 stops and 6 stops of effective image stabilisation respectively. Canon EOS R5: Build and Handling To tempt existing DSLR users and professionals to the EOS R5, Canon had
        to get the build quality and ergonomics just right. The layout of buttons are dials does takes a little bit of getting used to coming from an DSLR like the EOS 5D Mark IV, what with there no longer being any buttons down the side of the screen and no dedicated buttons for things such as ISO, drive mode and AF mode. Inspecting it alongside the EOS R reveals the body is slightly chunkier, however the layout of controls on the top plate is identical. The on/off switch is positioned on the top left shoulder and the mode dial button is located inside the rear thumb dial. Just to the left of this is a square top plate panel. It’s smaller than you get on some Canon DSLRs, but it displays all the information you need clearly. Holding down the illumination button beside it lets you darken settings against a lighter background, or you can tap it to switch the standard view of exposure variables to an advanced one that displays a broader overview of shooting information. Above this is a movie-rec button, and quick access to the movie shooting modes is obtained by hitting the mode button followed by the info button. Behind the shutter button is a small multi-function (M-Fn) button that can, like ten of the other buttons across the body, be customised to an assortment of functions. Better still; users get the option to segregate customized settings between stills and movie modes. To access ISO, drive mode, AF mode, white balance and exposure compensation in an instant you can leave the M-Fn button set to its default Dial Function setting, selecting the setting from the rear dial and adjusting it from the front dial, or use the additional control ring found on RF lenses. In the case of the latter you’re also given the option to set the control ring so it adjusts the AF method, picture style or colour temperature, directly or while pressing the metering button. There’s plenty more to comment on at the rear. The M.Fn bar that made its debut on the EOS R came under heavy scrutiny and wasn’t particularly well received, so it’s no great surprise to see it excluded. In its place you get a more traditional arrangement of controls that will be familiar to those who have used Canon’s pro-spec DSLRs in the past. The AF joystick, or multi controller, is positioned higher than on cameras like the EOS 5D Mark IV so rather than moving your thumb down to control it you find yourself shifting your thumb to the left a little from its resting position. Initially I thought this might be a bit of a stretch, but I quickly found myself adjusting to its new position. On the subject of the thumb rest, it has a deeper profile than the EOS R’s, making the entire body feel more secure when it’s held in your right hand. The AF-ON button is conveniently positioned alongside the joystick; with the exposure lock and AF point select buttons also positioned within easy reach of your thumb. Magnify, info and quick menu buttons are located below, though it took a bit of time for my muscle memory to remember which is which without looking. Another well-received control is the control wheel at the rear. Smaller than control rings found on Canon’s pro-spec DSLRs, it’s invaluable for quickly scrolling through shots in playback mode, navigating the main menu with the joystick and refining exposure settings. The RATE button is also useful for selecting your best shots from your worst. It doubles up as a record button. Simply hold it and voice memos can be added to images in playback. The way a camera handles in day-to-day use is a hugely important and the EOS R5 excels in this respect. It’s constructed around a magnesium alloy chassis, which constitutes a robust feel that’s reassuringly built to endure the severities of professional use. As you’d expect from a camera of its pedigree, it’s also weather sealed to protect against invasion of moisture and dust. I found the size and feel of the handgrip not too dissimilar to the EOS 5D Mark IV. This is important as some of Canon’s premium RF lenses are not only big, but also very heavy – the RF 28-70mm f/2L USM weighing a colossal 1430g. The EOS R5’s body weighs 738g with battery and memory card inserted. This represents a 152g weight saving over the EOS 5D Mark IV, however it’s still around 60+g heavier than the Nikon Z7 II. Another rival, the Panasonic Lumix S1R , weighs a hefty 282g more than the EOS R5. Canon EOS R5: Viewfinder and Screen For composition and viewing, Canon has equipped the EOS R5 with a high-resolution 5.76m-dot electronic viewfinder that provides 0.76x magnification. It has a fast 120fps refresh rate when the display performance is set to smooth and in its power saving mode the refresh rate reduces to 60fps, which preserves battery power if you’re running low. The performance of the EVF in smooth mode is sublime. The key benefit over an optical finder is the way it accurately displays exposure adjustments as they’re made and changes to depth of field when the DOF preview button is used. The
        clarity and sharpness on the EOS R’s EVF was excellent, but the EOS R5’s is even better. It displays a remarkably sharp view of subjects and scenes to the point you forget it’s electronic, and its representation of colour is true to that rendered by the screen and also our eyes. The magnify button combines well with the EVF when you’d like to zoom in at 6x or 15x magnification to inspect sharpness before a shot is taken. The only thing I would say is that if you wear glasses or frequently shoot in the portrait format, you may want to change the viewfinder display format from its default Display 1 setting to Display 2 if you’d prefer a larger back border around the edge and view exposure information clearly against a black background as opposed to it being overlaid on the preview image. Below it is a large 3.2in, 2.1m-dot fully articulated touchscreen that crucially doesn’t foul the 3.5mm microphone port when it’s pulled out and tilted. Articulated screens are naturally more susceptible to damage than fixed screens, but the slimline unit befits the robust build of the body, tilts smoothly and can be folded in to protect it when not in use. After all these years of Canon’s 5D-series of DSLRs having fixed rear screens, it’s a luxury having the option to shoot handheld from high or low angles without rummaging in the dirt or simply pointing and hoping for the best. The panel is sensitive to light touches and makes for a precise way of navigating the menus and selecting settings from the quick menu, which arranges frequently used settings down either side of the screen. Canon EOS R5: Autofocus performance Designed to be extremely versatile for stills and video, the EOS R5 has a lot to live up to in terms of performance if it’s to meet a variety of users requirements. Testing the autofocus speed on a wide range of subjects, including some challenging action sequences, demonstrated that it’s highly responsive in One Shot and Servo modes. Not only is autofocus brisk, Canon has made it remarkably easy to toggle between AF area modes with the small M-Fn button after using the AF point select button. Zone AF combined well with Servo AF to keep apace with cars and cyclists approaching the camera head-on. Only when I pulled back quickly from 200mm to 70mm did the camera misinterpret focus, which I put down to the subject moving outside my central Zone AF area. There’s the option to choose from two AF point sizes (pinpoint and normal), but having the ability to resize the AF point and the Zone AF area to a size of the users liking, much like Fujifilm and Panasonic offer, is something I’d like to see Canon introduce. Switching over to the wider horizontal and vertical Zone AF area modes can result in better success and anyone who wants to track erratically moving subjects to the far edge of the frame will want to use the AF tracking mode from which continuous shooting at 20fps is available. This is where you also benefit from face and eye detection, which works exceptionally well in both One Shot and Servo modes. The R5 is now more responsive at identifying people’s eyes and faces from greater distance than the EOS R, and the AF select button and joystick can be used to prioritise which face or eye you’d like the camera to focus on. With the subject detection set to animals, users will find the camera accurately detects cats, dogs and birds faces and eyes in a similar way as it does for people. I was particularly impressed by the way face detection picked out cricketers heads, even when they weren’t looking towards the camera. As with other aspects of the EOS R5, firmware updates have enhanced the camera’s autofocus skills. V1.5.0 brought advanced recognition of fast-moving vehicles including the ability to lock onto a driver’s helmet if it is visible. Another highlight of the EOS R5 is its ability to acquire focus in light levels as low as -6EV. In use, it locked onto and acquired accurate focus in poorly lit scenes with ease. Anyone who is regularly challenged by minimal ambient light will value this greatly. Canon EOS R5: Performance It’s only by using a camera extensively that you find out any peculiarities it might have. The EOS R5 doesn’t have many quirks, but with the screen being as sensitive as it is to light touches, it’s very easy to inadvertently fire the shutter when touch shutter is enabled. This became frustrating to the point I ended up disabling it. Reviewing and inspecting images at high magnification also requires the switch dial setting to be enabled if you’d like to intuitively control the magnify/index view from the front top plate dial. I’m surprised Canon didn’t chose to have this set to enabled out of the box. A lot has been reported about the excessive heat that’s generated when the EOS R5 is asked to record high-resolution video. Naturally findings will vary depending on the situation and conditions the camera is tested in. Recording full sensor width 8K Raw video internally to the card at
        25fps in a room at 23°C from a cold start resulted in 17 minutes 21 seconds of continuous footage being recorded – just short of the specified 20 minutes. An overheat warning icon popped up onscreen after 14 minutes and the rear of the camera became very warm to touch. After being left to cool, I switched to full sensor width 4K 120p recording. It managed 4 minutes before the overheat icon reappeared and the camera shut itself down three minutes later due to overheating. Before recording starts, the camera displays an estimate of the recordable time based on the current camera temperature and the set recording mode. It went on to record full sensor width 4K 60p footage for 29mins 59secs with no overheating, though expect to get ten minutes less if you select the APS-C crop (5.1K oversampled) setting. Recording full sensor width 4K 30P footage from a cold start didn’t reveal any overheating concerns. The issue that’ll put serious video users off the EOS R5 is the irritating cool down time that’s required between spells of recording. If you shoot short snippets of 8K and 4K video you can get away with not having to let the camera cool before you shoot again, but any lengthy recordings do require you to wait, which isn’t always possible on set or during a never-to-be-repeated scenario. The time until the full record time is available again varies based on factors such as the selected shooting resolution, ambient temperature and continued camera operation. At 8K 30P, 20 minutes of cool down time gives users an extra 8 minutes of recording time, whereas at 4K 60P, 10 minutes cool down time gives another 10 minutes of record time. Testing the IBIS system confirmed that it reliably stabilises handheld shots and video footage, but how slow you can attain sharp handheld shots is still very dependent on how steady your handheld technique is. I had no difficultly achieving sharp shots at shutter speeds as slow as 1/5sec using the RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM at full telephoto, and 2secs with the RF 15-35mm f/2.8L IS USM at its widest point. If you’d like to shoot without IBIS you’ll need to turn stabilisation off directly from the lens. The third lens Canon sent with the camera was the optically stellar RF 24-70mm f/2.8L IS USM, a lens that’ll allow you to shoot up to 8 stops slower than would otherwise be possible. Testing the camera with a SanDisk Extreme Pro 512GB CFexpress card capable of 1700MB/s read and 1400MB/s write speeds, resulted in 2851 raw files being recorded to the card at 12fps using the mechanical shutter before the buffer was hit. Switching to the Large JPEG file format saw an unlimited number of files being recorded. In electronic shutter mode, the EOS R5 rattled off 62 uncompressed raw files (121 CRAW’s) at 20fps in electronic shutter mode before its buffer was reached. This number increased to 130 frames when shooting Large JPEG images. I also managed to record 58 raws/JPEG files at 20fps before any sign of slowdown. Despite talk of some EOS R5’s overheating when shooting continuously, I experienced no such issue of this, not even when shooting sport for an afternoon in temperatures as hot as 34°C. While the build up of heat impairs its video performance, the EOS R5’s performance as a stills camera is outstanding. You can’t fail to be impressed by its attractive images, faithful colour and the way it focuses and controls noise when more is asked of it in low light. The only area where DSLRs really still hold an advantage is battery life. With the EOS R5 being power hungry, especially when shooting high-resolution video or continuous bursts, users will want to carry a few spares, buy the BG-R10 battery grip ($349/£379) or get into the habit of topping up power on the go via USB. You’ll need a power bank with at least 20W power delivery to charge the camera and 65W to charge and run the camera at the same time. As previously mentioned, firmware v1.60 brought along the Auto Power Off Temperature option and selecting High means the camera can give longer video shooting times, depending on the ambient conditions. Canon EOS R5: Image Quality Those curious to know more about the camera’s crop modes will find five settings in the menu that can be assigned to a custom button for instant access. As well as recording stunningly detailed 45MP (8192×5464 pixel) images, which equates to a 27x18in or 69x46cm print at a critically sharp 300ppi output resolution, there’s a 1.6x crop setting for those who’d like to gain greater reach from their lenses at a reduced 17MP (5088×3392 pixel) resolution. Other crop modes include 1:1 (5456×5456 pixel), 4:3 (7280×5464 pixel) and 16:9 (8192×4608 pixel), outputting 30MP, 40MP and 38MP files respectively. Editing a few underexposed landscape raw files where I’d exposed for the sky to preserve highlight detail revealed that users can put a huge amount of faith in the camera’s dynamic range. The sensor offers quite remarkable leverage when it comes to recovering shadow detail,
        which is best illustrated by the processed image of Beachy Head below. As always there isn’t as much leeway when it comes to recovering highlights from raw files. In high-contrast scenes users may wish to take advantage of the new HEIF image format that boasts 10-bit colour for greater dynamic range andhigher image quality than JPEG files, but outputs at approximately the same file size. It’s also possible to process HEIF files in-camera to produce JPEG files with a wider dynamic range than regular JPEGs. The detail that’s resolved in raw files, especially at high ISO, is astonishing. It gives great freedom to crop tightly into images whilst preserving high detail and the way it resolves such fine detail at ISO 12,800 and ISO 25,600 means that they’re useable in low light with some noise reduction applied. Users will also be delighted by the way the sensor controls colour noise and preserves faithful colour and vivid saturation high into its ISO range. The EOS R5’s terrific image quality is backed up by an impeccable metering system that rarely misjudges a scene. Canon EOS R5: ISO and Noise A key strength of the EOS R5 is the way it handles noise in its raw files at high sensitivity settings. You can expect clean, noise-free images between ISO 50 and ISO 800. Luminance noise does starts to appear at ISO 1600, however it’s only apparent when you examine images critically at 100% magnification. Noise is superbly controlled at ISO 3200 and ISO 6400 too, though both settings do benefit from a little noise reduction in post processing. The detail the EOS R5 resolves at even higher settings is mightily impressive and I wouldn’t be reluctant to shoot as high as ISO 12,800 or ISO 25,600 when presented by extremely challenging lighting conditions. Fine detail is affected more noticeably at ISO 51,200 and ISO 102,400. What with there also being a green tinge and reduction in colour saturation at these highest two settings, it’s best to steer clear of them.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Although the Z7 II hasn’t strayed far away from the original Z7 and is a relatively minor update on what we’ve seen before, Nikon has listened to constructive feedback from critics and acted on it to create its finest high-resolution mirrorless camera to date. The standout improvement is the introduction of a second card slot that’s seen as essential by photographers who can’t risk losing precious images should a single memory card fail, corrupt or get damaged. Some people will still question why the original Z7 didn’t include dual slots in the first place. For that we have no answer and can only guess Nikon didn’t expect a single card slot to create as much hullabaloo as it did. There’s more besides the second slot and its dual image processors speed things up. It only shoots 1fps faster, but with a deeper buffer and 10fps shooting (Single AF) it can now shoot more raw files faster than the Nikon D850. Other improvements such as being able to use it with a proper vertical grip, record 4K video at 60fps and focus accurately in darker environments are welcome. I’m a fan of the way Nikon has integrated its face, eye and animal detection modes to the Wide-area AF mode and offers quick access to them via the iMenu. The focusing performance is respectable, but it’s still not perfect for action and sports photographers with only 9-point dynamic-area AF and no group-area AF. There are photographers, myself included, who’d very much like to see Nikon offer the option to refine the size of the AF point, or allow different groups of AF points to be selected. Nikon got the handling and placement of controls just right on its Z-series models from the start. The Z7 II, like the Z7, feels fantastic in the hand and is a delight to pick up and use. Then there’s its fabulous image quality, which despite offering no improvement over the Z7, is remarkably impressive and offers magnificent latitude when processing Raw files. Compared to the Sony A7R V and Canon EOS R5, the Nikon Z7 II is well priced for such an impressive high-resolution full-frame camera. Nikon users who view twin card slots as essential are likely to buy the Z7 II or upgrade to it, and it does make the better buy for anyone thinking now is the time to switch from a DSLR to Nikon’s Z-series mirrorless system. For photographers who already own a Z7, are satisfied with it, and can live with a single card slot, an upgrade is hard to justify. Even if you sell your Z7 in good condition you can expect to make up a considerable shortfall to get your hands on a Z7 II. To conclude, the Z7 II is a minor, but important refresh of one of our favourite high resolution full-frame mirrorless cameras and comes highly recommended.

      value: 'Nikon Z7 II at a glance: Doesn’t time fly. It feels like yesterday Nikon entered the full-frame mirrorless market with the Z6 and Z7, but it was actually five years ago. Nikon didn’t rest on its laurels, however, and the Z6 II and Z7 II were both launched in 2020 together with the Z5 . The retro Z fc appeared in the middle of 2021 and in the autumn, Nikon’s much-anticipated Z9 pro flagship was finally unveiled and there is no doubt that this model has done incredible things for the brand’s standing, putting it right back up there alongside Canon and Sony. Nikon’s top-end offerings were further bolstered by the Z8 . The Z7 II follows on from the popular Z7 and becomes the leading enthusiast model in the Z-series. It’s virtually identical in terms of design and sets out to address the shortcomings of the original. Will it entice those who haven’t already switched to mirrorless to do so and is it worthwhile upgrade from the Z7 ? These are all questions I intend to answer. Nikon Z7 II: Features In terms of resolution, the Z7 II inherits the same 45.7MP back-illuminated full-frame sensor from the Z7, which is different from the 24.5MP sensor used in the Z6 and Z6 II in the way it does without an anti-aliasing filter. With an identical sensor there’s no change to sensitivity range, which can be set between ISO 64-25,600 (expandable to ISO 32-102,400). Rather than pairing the sensor with a single EXPEED 6 processing engine like in the Z7, the Nikon Z7 II boasts dual EXPEED 6 image processors, enabling it to shoot faster for longer. It shoots at up to 10fps using a single autofocus point (with no subject tracking) and the size of its buffer has improved significantly. Nikon claims it can rattle out 77 raws (12-bit), or 200 JPEGs. By comparison, the original Z7 could only manage 25 JPEGs at 9fps, or 20 raw files at 9fps before its buffer capacity was reached. To ensure a fast readout is achieved, the Z7 II once again features a CFexpress/XQD card slot. This time though Nikon has answered those who shamed the Z7 for only having a single slot by introducing a second UHS-II SD card slot. This update will be well received by those who don’t like the thought of having all their eggs in one basket and not being able to backup, overflow or segregate to a different card. The hybrid autofocus system, which combines contrast and phase detection points across 90% of its sensor’s surface area is similar, although a few refinements have been made. In total there are 493 phase detection points compared to the Z6 II’s 273 points, with the option to select every other point for faster AF point repositioning across the frame. The detection range of the AF system is wider than the Z7’s, allowing it to focus more effectively in dark scenarios. It spans from -3EV to +19EV, or -4EV to +19EV when used in its low-light AF mode. Pinpoint AF helps with precise focusing on small subjects in the frame and other AF-area modes include single-point AF, the choice of two wide-area AF modes (S and L) and an auto-area AF mode. Unlike the Z7 , face, eye and animal detection can now be used in the larger of the two wide-area AF modes, as well as Auto-area AF. Nikon has added face, eye and animal detection settings to the iMenu too and rather than being limited to stills only like the Z7 , they’re available when shooting video too. This leads us nicely to the Z7 II’s video capabilities. It’s equipped with 4K recording, but unlike the Z7 that was limited to 30fps, the highest frame rate has increased to 60fps. It’s worth noting that 4K/60p 8-bit video can be recorded internally, however and a small crop (approximately 93% of the FX frame width) is applied. Full HD at up to 120fps is available too and for long shoots or lengthy time-lapse sequences there’s the option to provide constant power to the camera (or charge the battery) via a powerbank and USB Type-C cable. Peaking and zebra pattern displays can be used to refine focus and exposure, while VR and Active D-Lighting are both available. Videographers also get 3.5mm microphone and headphone ports, the option to output ProRes raw over HDMI to an external recorder and the option to refine autofocus speed and the tracking sensitivity. The move to Nikon’s latest EN-EL15c Li-ion battery has resulted in increased battery life. Capable of shooting 420 shots using the LCD, or 360 shots using the EVF, it surpasses the 330 shot stamina of the original Z7. In most other respects, very little has changed. The Z7 II benefits from the same effective 5-axis in-body stabilisation system, has a shutter speed range of 30secs to 1/8000sec with a top speed of 1/2000sec using its electronic first-curtain option, and provides TTL metering with 5-stop exposure compensation control. The only other minor change is to Nikon’s SnapBridge app, which lets users update firmware on the camera direct from their smartphone using the power of Wi-fi and Bluetooth connectivity. There’s all the usual wireless control you might
        expect, including the option to take remote control of the camera and establish an always-on Bluetooth LE connection that enables every single picture you shoot to be automatically transferred to your phone. Focal Points Nikon Z7 II: Build and Handling Compare the Z7 II to the Z7 and you’ll struggle to detect differences between the two. If it wasn’t for the badge at the front giving away their identity you could be easily mistaken for thinking they’re identical. Take a much closer look at the pair from above and you might say the Z7 II is slightly chunkier. This isn’t an illusion; the Z7 II is fractionally larger and has a body depth that’s 2mm thicker to accommodate the new SD card alongside the CFexpress/XQD slot. You may also notice the memory card door is slightly larger and the EVF eyepiece doesn’t overhang the screen as much at the rear. The minor difference in depth has no impact on the way the camera feels in the hand and it upholds the fantastic handling characteristics of the original. It’s built around a magnesium alloy chassis like the Z7 , which comes fully weather sealed to prevent moisture, dust and dirt penetrating past the seams and damaging the electronics. It didn’t flinch at being subjected to squally rain showers during testing and performed well in bitterly cold conditions, with no changes in operational behaviour. The only thing to watch out for is that if you do want to access the USB port to charge or power the camera in foul weather, it does expose the HDMI and accessory terminals. Nikon’s Z-series cameras may not be the most visually attractive cameras on the eye and are quite far removed from the look of the company’s DSLRs, yet I uphold what I’ve said many times before in that they offer the finest handling experience of any mirrorless cameras on the market. This is quite a bold claim, but having tested and used such a wide variety of cameras there’s something special about how comfortable Nikon’s full-frame mirrorless cameras feel when they’re picked up and used over long spells of shooting. The Z7 II is no exception and the superbly sculpted rubberised handgrip and chunky thumb rest combine to give it a solid and secure feel in your hand. If I had to pick between the Canon EOS R5 , Nikon Z7 II and Sony Alpha 7R IV based on the quality of their handling alone I’d choose the Z7 II every time. We were very complimentary of the positioning of buttons, dials and controls on the Z7. All of the controls on the Nikon Z7 II are in exactly the same place, which is good news for anyone who might upgrade, as they’ll be able to make the switch and immediately feel at home. Nikon DSLR users who transition to the Z7 II will also find there’s not much new to learn, with buttons sensibly located across the body where you’d expect to find them. All-important buttons are within reach of your right hand with exception of the playback and delete buttons that are positioned out of the way to the left of the viewfinder to prevent accidental presses. Having the playback button on the edge of the body makes it easy to flick between shooting and reviewing, and like all the buttons on the body, it has a fairly soft, spongy feel and is totally silent. The mode dial is a located from the top left shoulder and needs the central lock button to be depressed as it’s rotated. Instead of getting a drive dial beneath, drive modes are selected from a dedicated button below the menu button using the d-pad rather than the front/rear thumb dials like on the Z7 . Users get a knurled joystick that falls naturally under the thumb and the focus point can be shifted diagonally across the frame as well as up/down, left/right to get it where you need it as fast as possible. Turning to the top plate, the front and rear thumb dials are well positioned for making quick exposure adjustments and the movie-record button only starts recording when movie mode is engaged from the stills/video switch. Like many of the buttons across the body, the movie-rec button can be assigned to different stills and video functions from the main menu. I found it useful setting it to ‘Choose Image Area’ in stills mode to quickly access the Z7 II’s various crop modes, which include DX (19.5MP), 5:4 (37.9MP), 1:1 (30.3MP) and 16:9 (38.3MP). As previously mentioned, you can also customise the iMenu to your preference. Unlike the Nikon Z5 , the Nikon Z7 II benefits from a square top plate display that reveals all the key shooting information you might want to glance down at such as shutter speed, aperture, ISO, battery power, drive mode and the remaining capacity of the memory card. It displays information white on black and there’s no way of inverting the display like on some cameras. It is however intelligent enough to automatically adapt to the ambient light conditions and switch off when the camera goes to sleep. Nikon Z7 II: Vertical grip It was a little disappointing Nikon didn’t design the MB-N10 as a proper vertical grip for the original
        Z7 , which simply holds a pair of batteries and doesn’t duplicate the most important buttons and controls to make shooting in the portrait orientation easier. Thankfully this has been addressed with the introduction of the MB-N11 vertical grip, which is also compatible with the Z6 II . Loading it with a pair of batteries increases the battery stamina to over 300 shots, however you’ll need to use either EN-EL15c or EN-EL15b batteries if you’d like to charge them via the built-in USB-C port. The grip allows hot-swapping of batteries without losing power to the camera and the benefit of it having its own USB port means it frees up the camera’s USB port for other uses and lets users charge two batteries one after the other when it’s disconnected from the camera. In terms of controls, it has a shutter button, front and rear dials, AF-ON button and an AF-area joystick. Dust- and drip-resistant, the MB-11 adds 290g to the weight of the camera (without batteries). Nikon Z7 II: Viewfinder and Screen Nikon has used a 0.5in, 3.69-million-dot electronic across all three of its previous full frame mirrorless models. We thought we might see a move to a 5.76-million dot viewfinder to match the resolution offered by the Canon EOS R5 and Sony A7R IV, however the Z 7 II features the same 3.69-million-dot panel used by the Z7 with 0.8x magnification. The EVF has a reasonably fast refresh rate of 60fps and displays shooting information clearly against black background strips above and below the preview image. If you typically shoot with the viewfinder raised to your eye you can use the button on the shoulder of the EVF to change it from automatically switching between the viewfinder and screen to viewfinder only. Likewise, you can do the same if you’d prefer composing and viewing using only the screen. Below the EVF you’ll find a high-resolution 2.1M-dot touchscreen that again tilts 90degrees up and 45degrees down. It offers the same manoeuvrability as the screen found on Sony’s A7R IV , but doesn’t allow as much freedom of movement as fully-articulated screens like those found on models like the Canon EOS R5 . Although low and high level shooting in the portrait format isn’t the Nikon Z7 II’s forte, the screen unit itself is nice and thin, pulls out effortlessly and is incredibly responsive to finger taps and presses, even with raindrops on its surface. Navigating the menus, adjusting key exposure variables and swiping between or zooming into images with a double tap in playback are all extremely easy to do using the touchscreen and its smartphone-like response makes for a great way of controlling the camera in darkness or when you don’t dare risk nudging your setup having composed the perfect shot on a tripod. Nikon Z7 II: Autofocus Intrigued to find out what affect the new processing power has on performance, I headed to a local forest to photograph mountain bikers at speed. Within minutes of shooting I noticed an improvement in the speed of the feed from the sensor to the EVF when focusing continuously and attempting to track fast and erratic subjects. Whereas it was quite easy to lose the subject in the frame when shooting with the Z7, there was a noticeable improvement switching over to the Z7 II, which didn’t suffer from the same lag or let me lose sight of the subject in the frame. As for the response of autofocus, the Z7 II is fast at finding focus in Single AF (AF-S) and did a fairly good job of keeping up with fast moving subjects when shooting a burst in continuous (AF-C) mode, though there were a few times at longer focal lengths where I noticed a momentary delay acquiring focus between near and far subjects. The Z 7 II’s autofocus has improved and it manages to focus accurately in dark conditions, however there is still room for improvement. While the Z7 II has advantages over Nikon DSLRs in the way it provides wider autofocus coverage and effective eye detection, cameras like the D850 and D5 have more complex autofocus tracking algorithms and the option to use group-area AF and select wider dynamic-area AF. Using the Z 7 II on a portrait shoot highlighted just how effective its face and eye detection is, which I’d say is on par with the responsiveness of Sony’s Eye AF. Having the option to use face and eye detection in the larger of the two wide-area modes is a useful and means you no longer rely on auto-area AF and can specify a person in a group you’d like to target. Like in stills mode, the joystick can be flicked left and right to choose which eye you’d like the camera to prioritise focus on when recording video. Reviewing a few video clips highlighted the Z 7 II does an extremely good job of maintaining focus on faces and eyes, even whilst moving and zooming. Nikon Z7 II: Performance Keeping on the subject of display, the performance of the Z 7 II’s EVF is excellent and will impress even the most devoted DSLR users who are yet to be convinced that electronic viewfinders are the way forward. The high quality
        optics produce an extremely clear view right to the edge of the frame, with the key advantages over an optical viewfinder being that you can observe exposure changes live and inspect a highly accurate view of how different aperture values affect depth of field. Using the magnify button at the rear to zoom in with the camera held to your eye reveals just how sharp the EVF is and it’s good to see Nikon reducing the frame rate of the EVF in Energy Saving Mode for times when it’s crucial that battery power is preserved. One other revision to the EVF is that it now automatically turns off when the rear screen is flipped out. As well as increasing battery life, it makes shooting easier as the eye sensor will not interfere with turning the monitor off when standing directly behind the camera or when touching the screen. My only gripe about the screen (other than the fact it can’t be tilted in the portrait format) is that there’s still no way to turn off all the shooting information to view the scene or subject you’re photographing without any distracting settings around the perimeter. You’d have thought this would be easy by cycling through the display options using the DISP button, but no. It’s similar in playback too. I’d like to be able to hit the DISP button to review images without file information lining the bottom of the screen, or having to zoom in slightly. Shooting a series of action sequences gave me a good chance to test the Z 7 II’s continuous shooting and buffer capabilities. Loaded with a 64GB XQD card capable of 440MB/s read and 400MB/s write speeds revealed it’s in a different league to the Z7 when it’s asked to rattle out bursts for a sustained period. I managed to record 56 12-bit raw files at 10fps to my XQD card before slowdown occurred. Switching the image quality to Fine JPEG resulted in 102 images being recorded. With an even faster XQD or CFexpress card such as those that offer write speeds up to and above 1200MB/s, I expect the claimed 77 12-bit raw, or 200 JPEG figures could be achieved. [UPDATE] Before the camera had to be returned to Nikon I tested the Z7 II with a new Manfrotto Professional 128GB CFexpress Type B memory card capable of 1730MB/s read and 1540MB/s write speeds. With the NEF (Raw) recording compression set to compressed and the bit depth set to 12-bit, I successfully managed to shoot a burst of 74 raw files at 10fps. Switching over to Fine JPEG resulted in 139 frames being recorded at 10fps before the limit of the buffer was hit. With the image quality set to JPEG (normal) the Z7 II rattled off 148 consecutive frames at 10fps. To shoot at the fastest speed of 10fps the Continuous H (extended) setting must be selected, although users should be aware the speed drops to 9fps when shooting 14-bit raw files. Set the Z7 II’s focus mode to AF-C (continuous) and the fastest it’ll shoot 12-bit raws in Continuous H (extended) is 9fps with the caveat that the shutter speed must be higher than 1/250sec. Attempt to shoot 14-bit raws in AF-C in Continuous H (extended) and the Z7 II shoots at a maximum of 5fps provided the shutter speed remains above 1/250sec. The maximum speed in the Continuous H setting is 5.5fps, which drops ever so slightly to 5fps when shooting 14-bit raw. In Continuous L users get the option to set the frame rate between 1fps and 5fps. In general operation, the Z 7 II springs into life as soon as the on/off switch is flicked from your index finger. All buttons respond instantly when they’re held or pressed, the joystick reacts immediately to any shift in direction and at no point does it feel like it’s a camera that’ll slow you down. The above, combined with its intuitive layout of controls, makes it extremely enjoyable to operate when taking photos for pleasure or when it is being used in a pressured environment. The sense that the Z 7 II has been meticulously thought through and expertly engineered for demanding enthusiasts and seasoned professionals who have very high expectations really shines through. The Z 7 II’s in-body image stabilisation performs just as reliably as the Z 7’s and plays an important role in being able to achieve sharp handheld shots in challenging low-light scenarios. As per usual there’s the option to select Normal, Sport or Off modes, however Nikon still doesn’t allow the Vibration Reduction settings to be assigned to function or custom buttons so it has to be assigned to the iMenu, or My Menu for quick call up. When the camera is used handheld to shoot subjects that move quickly or unpredictably it’s worth remembering to switch from Normal to Sport mode to ensure the image in the viewfinder remains as stable and smooth as possible. Paired with the Nikkor Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S, I was able to get sharp handheld images from a standing position at shutter speeds as slow as 1/10sec at 70mm, and 1/2sec at wideangle. With the Z 70-200mm F/2.8 VR S, I managed consistently sharp shots of static subjects at 1/25sec at full telephoto. With no dedicated
        metering mode button on the body, some users may wish to assign the Fn1 button to this function. A high majority of my test images were captured using the matrix metering mode, which exposes for scenes fairly well, however I did find myself dialling the exposure down by 0.3EV or 0.7EV at times to ensure detail in the brightest areas of a scene was preserved. Spot metering was effective in some tricky backlit scenes and although the camera does lean towards producing a fairly cool feel to images captured in sunny conditions using its Auto0 White balance mode, there’s the option to select Auto A1 and Auto A2 settings, which do a fine job of preserving the natural atmosphere of a scene and warm colours respectively. If you typically shoot outdoors you may prefer to use Natural light auto, which can be relied on to produced colours extremely close to those observed by the naked eye. Nikon Z7 II: Image Quality There’s the option of choosing between three image sizes when the Z7 II’s image area is set to FX. As well as outputting Large (45.4MP) 8256×5504 pixel files, there are Medium (25.6MP) 6192×4128 pixel and Small (11.4MP) 4128×2752 pixel image sizes to choose from. Switching the image area to DX applies a 1.5x crop of the sensor and can be used to gain extra reach from lenses, albeit at reduced resolution. In DX mode the Z 7 II outputs Large (19.5MP) 5408×3600 pixel files, with Medium (10.9MP) 4048×2696 pixel and Small (4.9MP) 2704×1800 pixel sizes also available. With no change in sensor, the Z 7 II delivers an identical image quality performance to that of its predecessor. This is no bad thing as we were overwhelmed by the detail and astonishing dynamic range of the Z 7 when we reviewed it. Sony’s A7R IV (and its replacement the Sony A7R V ) hold the crown of being the highest resolution full-frame mirrorless camera on the market, but unless you have a need to print larger than 40x60in on a regular basis, the Z7 II’s maximum resolution output will be more than sufficient. An advantage the Z 7 II presents over its rivals is its ability to shoot natively as low as ISO 64 without having to expand the sensitivity. This in turn allows truly astonishing levels of detail to be extracted from deep shadows during raw processing. Just as remarkable is the level of detail the sensor is able to resolve at high ISO, which like the Z7, is on par with the noise performance recorded by the Nikon D850 that uses a very similar sensor. Nikon Z7 II: ISO and Noise The Z 7 II’s ISO performance doesn’t reveal any surprises and is equally as impressive as the results recorded by the Z7. Shoot in raw and you’re guaranteed exceptionally clean, noise-free images between its base setting of ISO 64 and ISO 1600. Push to ISO 3200 and ISO 6400 and you’ll start to notice noise appear, but it’s so well controlled it can be easily be addressed by applying a little noise reduction in post. Extremely fine detail does take a hit at ISO 12,800, however I wouldn’t refrain using this setting or ISO 25,600 if I had to. Entering the expanded ISO 51,200 and ISO 102,400 settings sees image quality go downhill fast so you’ll want to avoid them. The automated noise reduction that’s applied to the Z 7 II’s JPEGs is good up to ISO 1600, after which point you’ll notice fine texture and detail starts to become smoothed out. Ultimately, the best image quality is achieved by shooting in raw, but for those who do shoot JPEGs at high ISO it’s preferable to reduce the high ISO noise reduction from normal to low.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Few cameras have arrived to quite as much excitement as the Nikon Z9. It is, arguably, the first mirrorless model to put itself forward as a complete replacement for any professional full-frame DSLR. You could argue that the Z9 doesn’t actually do very much that the Sony Alpha 1 doesn’t already offer, but the big difference is its chunky, robust build, integrated vertical grip for shooting with large lenses, and of course the familiar design and handling for long-term Nikon users. Not to mention the fact that it’ll work with their F-mount DSLR lenses via the FTZ 2 adapter. In practice, the Z9 delivers impressively on its considerable promise. It combines high resolution, breathtaking speed, and professional handling in a body so solidly built that it feels like it could stop a bullet. For current Nikon DSLR users, it’s considerably quicker than the D6 while delivering image quality that matches or surpasses the D850, only with significantly smaller file sizes. And it’s fitted with one of the most impressive autofocus systems that we’ve ever seen, and it’s been improved even further with firmware updates. In fact, what’s most striking about the Z9 is the way you can usually rely on it to identify and focus on the most important subject in the frame, taking one more task off your hands while you just get on with the process of composing and taking pictures. Its ability to shoot at 20fps in raw with reliable AF tracking also gives a higher chance of capturing the perfect moment. Essentially, it’s the final nail in the coffin for the pro DSLR. The Z9 is, however, a big, hefty and expensive beast. With the Nikkor Z 24-70mm F2.8 and 100-400mm lenses I used for this review, my bag added up to 3.5kg. This makes it a specialist tool for demanding jobs, and not the kind of camera that you’d lug around for the pleasure of taking pictures. That said, the Z9 is arguably the most impressive and capable camera you can currently buy.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Nikon Z9 at a glance: Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen a series of high-end full-frame mirrorless cameras whose capabilities decisively surpass anything their DSLR predecessors could offer. At the start of 2021, the remarkable Sony Alpha 1 kicked things off with its ability to shoot 50MP images at 30 frames per second. Then in September of the same year, Canon’s EOS R3 appeared offering 24MP at 30fps, but with game-changing eye-controlled autofocus for selecting subjects for tracking. Nikon was the last of the big three to reveal its hand. Its flagship Z9 is right up there as most accomplished of them all and one of the best cameras for photography you can buy. Building on the very solid foundations laid down by the Z9, Nikon recently introduced its Z8, a camera sharing most of its bigger brother’s features but in a more appealing smaller bodyform. The Z8’s all-round appeal is heightened further with its price, which is $3,997/£4,000 body only. Read our extensive Z8 review here . But enough of the new kid on the block, let’s get back to the Z9. The Nikon Z9 offers a combination of high-end specifications and professional-level build that simply hasn’t been seen before, making it one of the best Nikon mirrorless cameras . It can shoot 45.7MP raw files at 20fps for more than 1000 frames in succession, increasing to 30fps if you switch to JPEG-only. Drop the resolution to 11MP, and the Z9 will run at an astonishing 120fps. It can also record 8K video for several hours without overheating. Crucially, it promises the pro-level control setup and extreme durability that’s essential for photographers who make a living from their cameras. This decision appears to have paid off in one crucial respect, as doing without this complex, expensive component helps make the Z9 significantly less expensive than its rivals (although at $5497/£5,299, it still isn’t remotely cheap). But is this a step too far with current technology? Nikon Z9: Features Previously, Nikon split its pro-spec DSLR line between high-speed sports and action models such as the 20MP D6 , and high-resolution cameras for wedding, portrait and studio work like the 45.7MP D850 . But with the Z9, Nikon has aimed to produce a single camera that can do anything a professional photographer might need. It matches the D850 for resolution, while being capable of shooting considerably faster than the D6. Throw in a brand-new AI subject recognition autofocus system and 8K video recording, and this represents a considerable step up over anything Nikon users have seen before. Since the Z9’s launch in December 2021, it has enjoyed a raft of firmware updates that has brought significant benefits to the camera, especially its AF abilities. Enhanced subject detection, AF accuracy with low contrast subjects and continuous autofocus tracking are parameters that have seen notable improvements. Firmware 4.00 is currently available for the Z9. Of course, AF is just one aspect of the Z9, so click here to catch up with all the benefits thanks to firmware updates. In terms of headline specifications, the Nikon Z9 uses a 45.7MP full-frame sensor that offers ISO 64-25,600 as standard, and ISO 32-102,400 extended. This means it doesn’t match the ultra-high values offered by the 20MP D6, which provides ISO 102,400 as standard and a staggering extended ISO 3,280,000. But this is more than made up for by its sheer speed, with even the top 120fps rate still coming complete with continuous autofocus and tracking . Impressively, this is said to work with over 100 Nikon lenses, including F-mount DSLR lenses via the FTZ adapter, as well as native Z-mount optics. For more options have a look at the Best Z Mount lenses for Nikon mirrorless cameras. Nikon has achieved these speeds by using a stacked CMOS sensor, which employs a memory layer beneath the light-sensitive pixels for ultra-fast readout. This design practically eliminates distortion from rolling-shutter effects, while also providing a blackout-free viewfinder feed during continuous shooting. The Nikon Z9 also boasts Nikon’s most advanced autofocus system yet , with AI-based subject recognition to detect and track focus on people, animals and vehicles, including cars, motorbikes, trains and planes. It comes with a significant advantage over rival systems, in that you don’t have to specify in advance what you’re shooting; the camera will switch seamlessly between them. However, you can easily choose a specific subject if you prefer via the onscreen i-menu. Alternatively, there are 493 manually selectable autofocus points and a choice of 10 AF-area modes . Making a welcome debut on the Z-series is Nikon’s 3D-tracking , which will be familiar to its DSLR users. Like Nikon’s other full-frame Z-series cameras, five-axis in-body image stabilisation is on board and rated for up to six stops of shake suppression. When used with an optically stabilised lens, the two systems work together, with the lens taking on correction
        for vertical and horizontal shake. One notable new feature is a shield that protects the sensor when the camera is switched off, which is particularly welcome for those who need to change lenses in dusty conditions. To reduce the storage demands when shooting high-res files at high speeds, Nikon has introduced a high efficiency raw file format that promises to significantly reduce file sizes without any loss of detail. What it doesn’t do, though, is take any strain off your computer when it comes to raw processing. The firm has also added new AI-based auto white balance algorithms and is promising more accurate rendition of a diverse range of skin tones. Video specs are also very impressive. The Z9 can record in 8K resolution at 30 fps and Nikon says it’ll keep going for hours without overheating. Alternatively, it can shoot 4K at up to 120fps using the full width of the sensor. There’s a choice of 8-bit or 10-bit colour, with efficient H.265 compression to keep file sizes down. As befits a pro camera, extensive connectivity options are built in. There’s an RJ45 ethernet port and built-in high-speed Wi-Fi that supports sending images to a news desk via FTP. In principle, it’s even possible to connect the Z9 to a smartphone via USB-C for transferring images over mobile data networks using the NX MobileAir app, but this wasn’t available at the time of writing. More prosaically, the cameras is fully compatible with the SnapBridge app for connection to a smartphone, which supports both remote control over Wi-Fi and image transfer for sharing. Nikon Z9: Key features You’ll notice that Nikon has consciously designed the Z9 to closely resemble its D6 pro DSLR. Nikon Z9: Build and Handling In design terms, from the front the Z9 looks like a slightly shrunken version of Nikon’s professional D6 DSLR. It boasts an integrated vertical grip that houses a hefty battery, along with a viewfinder housing that’s styled to resemble the firm’s DSLRs much more than previous Z models. In contrast to the Canon EOS R3 , Nikon says its body is just as robust as its pro DSLRs, thanks to a fully weather-sealed magnesium alloy shell. The Z9 certainly feels pretty bomb-proof in your hand, and in my hands it survived some heavy winter showers with no ill effects. But in exchange, it’s notably heavy at 1340g. While that’s about 100g lighter than the D6, it’s over 300g heavier than the EOS R3 , and nearly twice the weight of the Sony A1 without its add-on grip. For reference, the new Z8 body weighs in at 910g. In terms of control setup, the Z9 will be instantly familiar to users of Nikon’s pro DSLRs. Almost its entire surface area, aside from the handgrips, is taken up by buttons and dials. As a result, pretty much every important setting can be changed quickly using a dedicated external control. A prominent release mode dial is situated on the left shoulder, giving access to low- and high-speed continuous shooting and the self-timer. The exact shooting rates and the timer delay are all user customisable, and there’s a further custom position that can be set to any of the camera’s shooting rates, including the 30fps and 120fps options. Meanwhile focus modes and AF-area settings are readily changed via a button on the left side. On the back, the layout is very much like existing Z-series models. There’s no space for a D6-style column of buttons to the left of the screen, so these have been rearranged to be easily accessible using your right thumb. Additional buttons beneath the screen are used for setting white balance and image quality and adding voice notes to images. The rear buttons can be illuminated for shooting in the dark with a quick flick of the power switch. Finally, three buttons on the front are set to switch between custom camera setups (which Nikon calls Shooting menu banks), select the image area (FX, DX, 1:1 and 16:9), and toggle the viewfinder display to a clean, uncluttered view. When set to DX crop, the Z9 still offers 20MP resolution, which makes it a great option for distant subjects such as wildlife. In principle, Shooting menu banks are a handy way of switching quickly between different camera configurations. But one notable catch is that they don’t include the release mode, even when the dial is set to its custom position, so it’s all too easy to find yourself shooting landscapes at 120fps if you’re not careful. Also, while you can give the settings banks meaningful names, the camera won’t show these in the viewfinder when selecting them via the Fn1 button. As expected for a pro camera, almost every control is user customisable. For example, you can reconfigure the dials to give direct access to exposure compensation or ISO in the P, A and S modes. Most of the buttons can be reassigned to a broad range of options, for example to engage 3D-tracking AF with a single press. Impressively, it’s also possible to configure buttons to change a whole group of settings with a single press, using the ‘Recall shooting functions’
        option. For example, you can set the AF-ON button so it also activates 3D-tracking, subject recognition, continuous shooting, and switches to S mode with a suitably fast shutter speed. This would be perfect for reacting quickly to moving subjects, except mysteriously, the ability to switch from AF-S to AF-C is missing. The camera’s vast array of physical buttons is nicely complemented by the touchscreen, which can be used to set the AF point, operate the menus, and browse images in playback. Nikon’s menu system is every bit as long and complex as you’d expect from a pro camera, but mercifully built-in help is available to explain most (if not quite all) of the options. If you do find yourself changing certain settings frequently, you can assign them to a custom My Menu, but this is a rather long-winded process. If I have one minor bugbear with the Z9’s handling, it’s that the buttons on the vertical grip are a bit too easily pressed by accident when you’re holding the camera in landscape format. They can be locked by flicking a switch around the vertical shutter button, but it would be helpful if the camera could be set to ignore them when it’s being held in landscape format. Nikon Z9: Viewfinder and screen On paper, the Z 9 promises a similar viewing experience to the Nikon Z 7 II . Its 3.69m-dot electronic viewfinder provides 0.8x magnification, while the rear touchscreen is a 3.2in, 2.1m-dot unit. There are, however, some significant difference. The Z9’s EVF is brighter – indeed Nikon claims that it’s the world’s brightest – and it can also provide a blackout-free view during continuous shooting. Instead, a flickering frame around the preview image acts as a visual cue when you’re taking pictures. In practice, the EVF is truly excellent, providing an extremely bright, detailed view. It may not be as large as the Sony Alpha 1’s 9.4m-dot, 0.9x unit, but it serves its purpose just as well. As usual it can show comprehensive shooting data, including a live histogram and electronic levels simultaneously. By default, the viewfinder previews colour processing and depth-of-field, while exposure is simulated across a +/-3 EV range. Alternatively, delve into the menus and you’ll find a View Mode (photo LV) option that neutralises colours, disables exposure preview and brightens shadows, all in a bid to mimic the optical viewfinder of DSLRs. The rear screen has also had a major upgrade, in that it can now tilt upwards by 90° when shooting in portrait format, as well as tilting up and down when the camera is held in the landscape orientation. This is a similar approach to several Panasonic and Fujifilm cameras, and I think it’s the best screen design for stills shooters in how it facilitates shooting at awkward angles. It can’t be set facing forwards, but I doubt Z9 users will care one bit. It isn’t affected by the View Mode setting, but instead always previews colour and exposure. Nikon Z9: Autofocus Perhaps the Z 9’s most important new feature is its AI subject detection autofocus, which represents a step forward compared to anything we’ve seen before. Both the Canon EOS R3 and Sony Alpha 1 use similar technology, but the big difference here is that you don’t have to pre-select what kind of subject you want the camera to recognise (human, animal, bird or vehicle). Instead, the Z9 simply picks out what it sees, outlines it in the viewfinder, and then proceeds to track focus on it around the frame. When there are multiple possible subjects in the frame, you can select between them using the joystick, which works well but isn’t quite as seamlessly intuitive as the Canon EOS R3’s eye control. Nikon doesn’t demand you always have to use subject recognition, of course. You still get a full set of AF modes, so you can position the AF point manually, or use 3D-tracking that works in a familiar fashion for DSLR users, following a specified subject based upon colour, size and distance. No matter how you use it, though, the Z9’s autofocus system works near-flawlessly almost all the time. Regardless of whether the subject is static or moving, or in the centre or corner of the frame, it just nails focus with a remarkable hit-rate, even if you’re shooting at 20, 30 or 120fps. Naturally it’s not quite perfect, and like all such systems the AI subject detection isn’t totally accurate. For example, when shooting birds with the Nikkor Z 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 S , I found it had a certain habit of latching onto details like twigs and frustratingly refusing to shift focus onto the clearly recognisable bird slightly behind. Occasionally, it’ll indicate that it’s found spurious faces in random areas of the image. But we’re rather splitting hairs here – for almost anyone buying a Z9, its AF system will be far quicker and more reliable anything they’ve used before. Nikon Z9: Performance Professional photographers require a camera that’s ready to use the instant they need it, and this is exactly what the Z9 provides. It starts up the moment
        you flick the power switch, and thereafter responds instantly to both the physical controls and the touchscreen. Once you’ve got used to how it works and have tweaked it to your liking, the Z9 gets out of your way and lets you concentrate on taking pictures. With no mechanical shutter, it’s also capable of being completely silent. For many professionals, this allows shooting in situations that previously wouldn’t have been possible, and unlike Nikon’s pro DSLRs, you can continue to use the viewfinder. Alternatively the camera can play a fake shutter sound, which can provide reassuring feedback when you take a picture. Crucially, in the thousands of images that I shot with the Z9, I didn’t see any negative effects attributable to the electronic shutter, such as rolling shutter distortion. When it comes to continuous shooting, in my testing the Z9 didn’t quite achieve Nikon’s promised 20fps for 1000 frames. But what it delivered was no less extraordinary. Using a Lexar Professional 64GB CFexpress card with a rated write speed of 1000 MB/s, I found it maintained 20fps for 6 seconds in full-resolution raw, before slowing down slightly to a sustained 16.5fps. But then it just kept on going until the card was full, ultimately recording a burst of 2638 frames in 159 seconds. You won’t get quite the same level of performance from older XQD cards. But with a Sony 32GB G-series card rated at 400MB/s, I found the Z 9 shot at 20fps for 2 seconds, before settling down to 10fps until the card was full. This is still pretty impressive stuff. This also highlights the importance of Nikon’s new high-efficiency raw file format, which keeps file sizes below 25MB, compared to 55MB for the Z 7 II which shares the same sensor resolution. This is crucial for maintaining such high speeds, and there’s no apparent drawback in terms of image quality. However, it’s worth knowing that if you switch to the obtusely named ‘High Efficiency *’ option, which prioritises quality over size, the average file size increases to about 35MB and shooting speeds slow down. This in turn leads onto battery life. In the Z9, the EN-EL18D is rated for 720 shots per charge, which sounds like a considerable step backwards from the D6’s 3580. Indeed, you’d be forgiven for concluding that it represents just 6 seconds shooting at 120fps. But really, this reflects that the CIPA standard battery-life test represents taking single shots at discrete intervals, and breaks down completely with this kind of high-speed camera. If you take a lot of high-speed bursts, you can shoot many thousands of frames without making a massive dent in the battery level indicator. When it comes to metering, the Z9 performs very well, to the extent that there’s rarely any need to use anything other than Matrix mode. It does a great job of avoiding clipping highlights irretrievably, without generally erring too much towards underexposure. On the odd occasion that it might need some compensation, you can see that clearly in the viewfinder. Nikon’s updated AI-based auto white balance system is also worthy of praise; I mostly used the Natural Light Auto mode, and found it delivered flawless colours almost all the time. In particular, where Nikon once veered towards over-neutrality in golden-hour light, it now does a brilliant job of enhancing those colours without looking unreal. As a result, you can usually trust the Z9 to deliver superb results in JPEG mode. This is crucial for a camera that pros need to rely on to deliver finished files directly to their newsdesks. Nikon’s colour rendition is generally very attractive, if perhaps not quite a match for the industry-leader in this regard, Fujifilm. The in-camera high-ISO noise reduction works particularly well, giving much cleaner images and stronger colours than Adobe’s raw processing (which is now looking distinctly outdated). Nikon’s in-body stabilisation system does a decent job of correcting camera shake when shooting hand-held. With the Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S at its wider settings, I was often able to get acceptable shots at shutter speeds as slow as 1 second. More generally, it means you shouldn’t ever have images spoiled by shake at more conventional shutter speeds. Raw image quality is also truly excellent. At low ISOs you get both impressive levels of detail and massive dynamic range, which allows you to pull up dark shadows pretty much as far as any software will sensibly let you. If there’s any difference compared to the Nikon Z 7 II here, it’s essentially academic. Naturally detail will suffer at high ISOs, but I was still quite happy using the top standard setting of ISO 25,600. Nikon Z9: ISO and Noise With its 45.7MP sensor, the Z9 can record an impressive amount of detail. Among its full-frame competitors, it’s only appreciably surpassed by a few 61MP models. At ISO 64, there’s absolutely no visible noise, making for exceptional image quality. By ISO 1600 luminance noise becomes appreciable, but even then, you have to stare
        at files at 100% onscreen to see it. Fine detail starts to blur away at ISO 6400, but it’s only when you hike the sensitivity to ISO 25,600 that noise really has a major negative impact. At this point, Nikon’s JPEGs do a considerably better job of suppressing noise and retaining colour than Adobe’s raw processing. The extended ISO 51,200 and ISO 102,400 settings lose almost all shadow detail and are best avoided if possible.

      value: While the EOS R6 has been around long enough for it to have been superseded by the EOS R6 Mark II, it remains a fine and capable camera with hybrid credentials. What’s more, it’s better value than ever, available new and on the pre-owned market. Matty Graham had the EOS R6 in his kit bag from launch and he’s still loving it
    - type: conclusion
      value: A photographer’s opinion of the EOS R6 will depend on which previous camera they measure it against. Do I prefer it over my old EOS 5D Mark IV ? Yes, absolutely. Despite the drop in megapixels, the improvements such as the vari-angle screen, burst speed and video features tick many of the boxes I was looking to fill. Yet there are still niggles that make me wish Canon had just pushed a little harder with the R6, although its price has fallen from its launch price to $1,999/£1,900 body only. Chiefly amongst my grumbles is the quality of the body materials, but this argument is easily countered by the benefits of its low weight. This may be a full-frame camera, but I can even use it on my Ronin SC gimbal to shoot super-steady footage. The EOS R6 has powerful rivals lined up against it. The Nikon Z6 II and Panasonic Lumix S5 II sell at $1,977/£1,709 and $1,998/£1,899 respectively. Both offer more resolution – 24.2MP – and impressive video skills, and that applies especially to the Lumix S5 II. Among diehard Canon users, many photographers (including professionals) will still be priced out from picking up the EOS R5, which costs $3,399/£4,149 body only, but the EOS R6 Mark II is a competitive $2,499/£2,779 body only. In short, the EOS R6 is a fantastic camera, packed with features that make a tangible difference out in the field. It can cut the mustard for enthusiasts and professionals alike, and for stills as well as video. But if you are a long-term Canon EOS 5D-series DSLR user, it might possibly leave you wanting just a little more. That said, the EOS R6 is still available new and of course there’s the money-saving pre-owned option. Read our full Canon EOS R6 review
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'As the market-leader in DSLR cameras, it was no surprise that Canon took its time committing to full-frame mirrorless. But once it did, its commitment was total and we haven’t seen a new Canon DSLR since the EOS-1D X was announced in early 2020 and it has been wall to wall mirrorless cameras and lenses ever since. The Canon EOS R6 was announced at the same time as the EOS R5 , Canon’s mirrorless flagship at the time. With its 45MP sensor, 20fps shooting and 8K video recording, it was the EOS R5 that grabbed most of the headlines. But its premium price-tag ($3899/£3899 at time of launch) meant that most full-frame Canon shooters, including myself, plumped for the 20MP EOS R6 all-rounder which was priced body only at $2499£/£2599 at launch – it’s now $1,999/£1,799 body only. For comparison’s sake, the recently introduced Canon EOS R6 Mark II is $2,499/£2,779 body only. So, how has my time with this camera gone? Canon EOS R6 at a glance Canon EOS R6: First impressions Over the years, I’ve owned a huge number of Canon EOS cameras; far too many to count but the list includes every 5D, both 7Ds, a 6D and many cameras from the XXD line, such as the 40D, 80D and 90D. Whenever I’ve taken on a new body, the change in handling has been seamless, but I have to admit that the R6 took a little relearning. The smaller, slimmer body has less space for controls and has too few buttons for my liking. Unlike the EOS R and R5, it also lacks a top plate LCD. I didn’t realise how much I used this until I found myself glancing down at the EOS R6, only to remind myself that it unfortunately misses this feature. What’s more, I had to get used to the lighter and more compact body. The EOS R6 body at 680g is over 200g lighter than the 890g EOS 5D Mark IV. It’s smaller in the hands too, with the R6 measuring 138x98x88mm compared to the larger EOS 5D Mark IV (151x116x76mm). On the other hand, only two out of the nine lenses I own are RF mount, and the extra weight and length of adding the EF-RF Mount Adapter to accommodate my EF lenses takes some getting used to. I must be honest and say that I find the actual feel of the camera somewhat underwhelming, as the texture and surface of the body materials feels less premium than what I was used to with the EOS 5D Mark IV. It just feels less pro-spec and certain components like the battery compartment flap trouble me. Then again, I freely admit that having used the camera intensely from new, nothing on the EOS R6 has gone wrong despite it being in the odd shower. Canon EOS R6: Plenty of deal-makers The advantages that the mirrorless EOS R6 boasts over Canon’s DSLRs are mainly to do with focusing and speed. However, the vari-angle LCD is also an absolute game-changer for me and allows me to compose low viewpoint images in a thrice without needing to lie down on the ground and trying to squint through a viewfinder. The touch-focus function on the sensitive LCD is a dream to use and I found the accuracy of tapping on a subject, with the focus system then picking up exactly what I intended, was seriously reliable. In fact, the focus system as a whole is a massive leap forward. For sports photography, I leave the Face Detection mode on and my hit rate of sharp shots is ridiculously high. It’s not completely infallible and dark scenes do make things harder, but in all my photography, it delivered a hit rate of more than nine out of ten. To fine-tune your focusing system further, the R6 offers a number of preset case studies that will change the behaviour of the servo mode; for example, there’s one to track subjects while ignoring possible obstacles, and another that instantly focuses on subjects suddenly entering AF point coverage. It’s worth spending an afternoon trying out each one to see how they work for your style of action photography. The EOS R6’s AF has improved further with a number of firmware updates; the latest firmware is 1.8.2. In firmware 1.5.0 head detection was improved to support helmets and goggles in winter sports, and Vehicles was added to Subject to detect in the AF tab to support detection of cars and motorcycles in motorsports; spot detection is also available to pick up on the helmet of the rider/driver. Eye detection stability and AF tracking with moving subjects was enhanced further in 1.5.2. It is, however, the burst speeds available from the R6 that will really push DSLR photographers to make the leap, as the R6 serves up 12fps in burst mode or a rapid 20fps option when the user switches to the silent electronic shutter. The advantages of such a mode to wildlife photographers are obvious, enabling them to capture fast action sequences without distracting or spooking subjects. Shooting multiple fast burst sequences will be a draw on battery life; the R6 is rated at 510 shots using the LCD, or 380 shots with the viewfinder. But the good news is that while the R6 ships with the newer LP-E6NH, it can also take the older LP-E6N batteries from Canon EOS DSLRs such
        as the 5D Mark IV and the 90D, so if you’re transitioning across to mirrorless you won’t have to rush out and spend big on extra batteries. Is the EOS R6 fast and accurate enough to be a genuine alternative to Canon’s pro-spec EOS-1D X cameras? I would say yes and, if the small form factor bothers you, photographers can also consider pairing the camera with the Canon BG-R10 grip, which retails at around $349/£379 and will also extend shooting time thanks to the extra battery. What’s more, the final deal-maker and is the long overdue provision from Canon of IBIS (in-body image stabiliser) and I found the five-axis system performed exceptionally well. Pair the EOS R6 with an IS lens and you can get up to eight stops of stabilisation, which is hugely useful when shooting with long focal lengths above 200mm, or in low light. Canon DSLR shooters who have been denied IBIS for so long may need some time to trust the system because you can capture sharp shots that were simply unattainable before. Canon EOS R6: Impressive image quality When it comes to sensor resolution, 20.1 million pixels doesn’t sound like a lot, especially when the R5 offers 45MP and its successor, the EOS R6 Mark II, has 24.2MP. But the EOS R6 still delivers a file size of 5472×3648 pixels – easily enough to create A3 prints or for heavy cropping with small in the frame shots. In reality, that should be enough for enthusiasts and professionals alike, and the actual quality of the imagery is clean and impressive with that Canon colour science we’ve always known and loved. With a native ISO range of 100-102,400, the R6 is well set to record images in low light. While few will consider shooting at the highest end of the range, the sensor handles noise incredibly well, with little sign of degradation even at ISO 40,000. Raw files hold a huge amount of tonal data, enabling shadows to be revealed and highlights recovered. This again nudges the camera’s performance into the pro-spec arena, surpassing what you’d get from an entry-level full-frame camera. As the icing on the cake, the EOS R6 offers both standard Raw and the smaller C-Raw files, which take up less space on your SD cards or hard drives with no loss in quality. Canon EOS R6: A true hybrid? Many of the creatives who handed over the cash for their EOS R6 when it was launched will have been just as interested in the camera’s video specifications as its stills technology. This is a genuine hybrid machine that will fit neatly into a film-makers kit set-up. Offering 4K video at 60p enables videographers to use this footage at half-speed, opening up the option of ultra-high-quality slow-motion sequences. Of course, you can also take advantage of the Full HD 120p for even slower footage. Make no mistake, the lightweight build makes the R6 an excellent ‘run and gun’ option for filmmakers looking to shoot light. At launch, the camera shipped with Canon’s C-Log 1 profile, but firmware update v1.4.0 added the Canon C-Log 3 option, enabling more creative options when grading footage. The combination of ports for headphones and external mic, the vari-angle LCD to touch and focus on a subject, and the high-resolution footage combine to make this a fantastic video option. What’s more, the dual SD card slots enables simultaneous recording to both cards. It’s possible to grab 8.3MP JPEGs from 4K footage if you wish to, but for me the greatest benefit of the R6 comes back to the Dual Pixel AF, which proves insanely accurate and speedy during video capture, even with fast-moving subjects in the frame or when the Face Detection AF is activated by a subject in the scene. The R6 is so good at video, I find I’m using it as much, if not more, than my C70 cinema camera. On a big production, it’s easy to use the two cameras in conjunction, both of which I keep set to the C-Log 1 profile.'

      value: Is the Nikon D3500 entry-level DSLR still a worthwhile buy in 2023? Audley Jarvis puts it to the test with a modern eye in our review.
    - type: conclusion
      value: While the D3500 inherits much from the D3400 that preceded it, there are some differences which combine to make the D3500 a better camera overall. The redesigned body clearly borrows a lot from the upper entry-level D5600 and the enlarged handgrip helps to make the camera feel more comfortable and better balanced when used with larger, heavier lenses. On top of this, the battery life has improved and the images it outputs are very respectable. Available for around £411 with the 18-55mm AF-P VR lens, or £399 with the non-VR 18-55mm AF-P lens, the D3500 is keenly priced and represents excellent value for money. If you can live without the slightly larger vari-angle touchscreen and more advanced 39-point autofocus system offered by the D5600, then the D3500 is undoubtedly an excellent choice for the first-time DSLR buyer. In all, it’s a reliable little camera that we have absolutely no hesitation in recommending to beginners.

      value: 'Is the Nikon D3500 discontinued? – In short, Yes. But whilst this affordable entry level crop sensor is no longer available new, prices for second hand models are expected to drop, and this could make it one of the best Nikon DSLRs for those on a budget. Find out how it performs in our full review: Nikon D3500 – At a glance The Nikon D3500 is a deservedly famous beginner’s DSLR. Blending portability and usability with the capacity to produce images of excellent quality, it’s really everything a beginning photographer could need, and as such is a fixture among students. With the historic Nikon-F lens mount at your disposal, you’ve got enough lenses to realistically last a shooting lifetime, too. But with mirrorless cameras hogging the limelight and the technological developments, Nikon’s best beginner’s DSLR is also likely its last. Is it still worth buying in 2023? Nikon has officially discontinued the camera, meaning it won’t be producing any more from the factories. However, the D3500 is still widely available on the used market, and you can also probably still find a few new ones on the shelves as stores continue to work through their stock. And there’s a reason it keeps hold of a place in our guide to the best cameras for beginners , and that’s because it still offers real value for money, especially with prices coming down on the second-hand market. However, there are a lot of reasons you may want to choose a newer mirrorless model instead, and those are only growing in number as more new cameras are released. If you want a rundown of the difference between the two formats, check out our comprehensive guide to DSLRs vs mirrorless . But otherwise, let’s get into our Nikon D5300 review… Nikon D3500 – Rivals and alternatives The Nikon D3500 arrived in 2018, replacing the Nikon D3400 , an entry-level camera that represented a pretty similar proposition with its 24.2MP APS-C sensor. The D3400 is still available on the second-hand market for generally $100/ £100 or so less than its successor, though the D3500 is generally a better buy. It’s lighter, better ergonomically and has a beefed-up battery. If you want to stick in the Nikon camp but want something even more advanced, then in the other direction is the Nikon D5600 . Adding in a tilting LCD screen and an input for a microphone, it’s generally a more sophisticated camera, especially for video users. But what about from other manufacturers? Well, if you’re interested in what Canon ahs to offer, there is the cheaper but simpler EOS 2000D , which offers about the same resolution as the D3500 but has a more rudimentary autofocus system. Canon also released at the same time an even cheaper beginner’s DSLR in the form of the EOS 4000D , but honestly we wouldn’t bother; it cuts the resolution down to 18MP, and just isn’t worth the money. In the other direction though, you have the slightly more advanced EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 , which is a little pricier than the D3500, but can shoot 4K video. If you want to go mirrorless there isn’t really a like-for-like comparison, but there are some solid alternatives. Nikon is keen to get photographers and videographers on board with its Nikon Z system, and beginners may want to consider the APS-C all-rounder Nikon Z50 or the vlogger-focused Nikon Z30 . Both will set you back less than $999 / £999 with a lens, and benefit from faster AF systems and better video. However, you don’t get that big tactile DSLR handgrip, nor the optical viewfinder. Other manufacturers only really offer mirrorless alternatives. Something like the Sony A6000 will give you just-as-good  image quality at a similar price point. Or, if you’ve got a bit more cash to spend, you could try the Fujifilm X-T30 , which has seen prices drop on the used market since the arrival of the Fujifilm X-T30 II , to the point you can get it with a lens for a decent three-figure price (try BH Photo + Video or MPB ). It uses the same-size sensor as the D3500, and delivers images full of character and punchy colours. These are some good alternatives to keep in mind as we take the Nikon D3500 out for a spin. So, let’s take a closer look at this capable camera… Nikon D3500 review – Features The D3500 is built around a 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor and Nikon’s EXPEED 4 image processor – a pairing that has served a number of other Nikon DSLRs extremely well in recent years. While effective resolution is identical to both the D3400 and D5600, Nikon has said that the D3500 is fitted with an updated sensor. As with many other recent Nikon DSLR releases, the D3500 does without an optical low-pass filter, so as to maximise the sensor’s ability to resolve fine detail. For those looking to shoot mainly JPEGs, the D3500 comes with the usual range of handy processing tools. This includes Nikon’s proprietary shadow-boosting Active D-Lighting technology, alongside tools for vignette control, distortion control and noise reduction. Furthermore, users can also select from a range of
        seven Picture Controls that adjust things like contrast, saturation and sharpness to give images a specific look and feel. As ever the options are: Standard, Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Portrait, Landscape and Flat. 7 Things You Need to Know About the D3500 In terms of exposure modes the D3500 offers Program, Aperture-priority, Shutter-priority and Manual (PASM) modes for more experienced users, alongside a fully automatic Auto mode for point-and-shoot duties and a Forced Flash Off mode. In addition, there are four individual Scene modes: Portrait, Sports, Close-up and Night Portrait, plus an Effects mode that allows you to apply a range of digital filter effects at the point of capture. Last but not least, is Nikon’s beginner-friendly Guide Mode. Accessed directly from the mode dial, Guide Mode essentially disables the in-camera menu and replaces it with a set of options tailored to specific situations. These aim to explain (in the simplest possible terms) how to use the camera’s key settings to the best effect. As before users are given a choice of ‘Easy’ and ‘Advanced’ shooting options, with the latter helping new users to do things like freeze motion, soften backgrounds and capture flowing water using a long exposure. While more experienced DSLR users can simply avoid Guide Mode altogether, first-time DSLR users may well find it immensely helpful. Video capability extends to 1080p Full HD video at up to 60fps , which compares favourably with the 1080p/30fps maximum setting of the Canon EOS 2000D . Sound is recorded by a built-in monaural microphone that can be adjusted via the in-camera menu, although in keeping with the D3400 there’s no input for an external microphone – for this you’ll want to look at the D5600. In terms of connectivity, the D3500 comes with Nikon’s proprietary SnapBridge technology, although as with the D3400 this comes at the expense of Wi-Fi, which is not supported. Instead, SnapBridge employs Bluetooth and connects directly to your phone or tablet via Nikon’s Wireless Mobile Utility (WMU) app. Once installed, you can choose to automatically transfer 2MB images directly to a connected smartphone or tablet, or you can manually export images at their original size. New for the D3500 is the ability to control the camera remotely via the WMU app too. Note that this does come at the expense of the infrared receiver that was located on the front of the D3400, which has been removed from the D3500. Pairing and set up is a straightforward task, and we found SnapBridge worked flawlessly during our time with the D3500. Nikon D3500 review – Body and design This new model sports a slimmed down and, to our minds at least, slightly more stylish look. It’s slightly smaller (and lighter) overall. This is primarily down to the fact that the D3500 is housed within a modified D5600 body, which at the time of its release in 2016 was billed as one of the smallest DSLRs on the market. The handgrip is actually slightly wider and squarer than it was on the D3400 , and combined with the more pronounced thumb-rest on the back, helps improve the camera’s general handling and also makes it feel more balanced when using larger lenses. Nikon has also relocated many of the buttons, moving them from the left-hand side of the camera to the right-hand side and top plate. The small control wheel found on the back of the D3400 has also been replaced with a prominent wheel on the top plate – as per the D5600. Likewise, the Live View button has been replaced with a small lever to the side of the exposure mode dial. Sadly though, the Fn button has been removed. Overall, while there was nothing inherently wrong with the design and handling of the D3400, we found that the redesigned body and remapped controls of the D3500 make it a more enjoyable camera to use overall. In terms of build quality, the D3500 is encased within a polycarbonate shell that’s robust enough to withstand the odd knock, but obviously not up to the same standard as the magnesium alloy casings employed by models higher up the range. Neither is the camera weather-sealed, although to be fair we wouldn’t really expect that given its price and positioning. Nikon D3500 review – Performance While the D3500 isn’t as powerful as more expensive Nikon DSLRs it remains a capable little camera in all but the most demanding situations. During timed tests we recorded 100 full-resolution JPEGs at 5fps before the memory buffer filled. In raw capture this dropped to around 12 consecutive images, while in raw+JPEG the figure was just six images. All in all, these figures are respectable and certainly on par with what we’d expect of an entry-level DSLR. By way of comparison, the Canon EOS 2000D records just 40 full-res JPEGs before the frame rate drops, although the figures for raw and raw+JPEG are almost identical as the D3500. Autofocus duties are catered for by the same Nikon Multi-CAM 1000 module employed by the D3400. It provides 11 AF-points arranged in a diamond
        formation across the viewfinder. Focus lock speeds through the viewfinder are impressively quick, with the AF module locking on the instant you half-press the shutter button. Switching to Live View the D3500 remains fast and accurate in all but the dimmest light, and is faster than Canon’s EOS 2000D, which is painfully slow by comparison. The D3400 was already a step ahead of the competition with regards to battery life, and the D3500 takes this further. The Nikon EN-EL14a Li-ion battery is now good for 1550 shots on a single charge – as opposed to 1200 on the D3400. By way of comparison, the Canon EOS 2000D is rated for around 500 shots per charge, while the D5600 is capable of 820. The D3500 is therefore, and by some margin, a class-leader in this respect. Resolution Shooting in raw, the D3500 resolved 3,200l/ph between ISO 100 and ISO 400. At ISO 800 the figure was 3,000l/ph. It’s only at ISO 3200 that resolution dips below 3,000l/ph. At ISO 6400 the D3500 produced a figure of 2,800l/ph followed by 2,500l/ph at ISO 12,800. The highest ISO 25,600 setting recorded 2,300l/ph. Noise As with resolution we achieved better results with manually processed raw files over in-camera JPEGs. At sensitivities under ISO 800 images are clean and sharp. At ISO 3200, image quality does begin to break down more markedly, with elements of luminance noise evident in JPEGs and processed raw files. You still get useable results at ISO 3200, but it’s harder to disguise the effects of noise at ISO 6400 and above.'

      value: It is still the most advanced APS-C DSLR Nikon ever made, and impressive even by today's standards, as Andy Westlake discovers in this Nikon D500 review
    - type: conclusion
      value: In recent years, photographers looking for a truly high-end APS-C DSLR for sports and action shooting have been more or less limited to Canon’s EOS 7D Mark II and perhaps the later EOS 90D . But with the D500, Nikon returned to this sector in fine style, and its combination of superb autofocus, fast continuous shooting and excellent image quality places it very much at the top of the list. It’s difficult not to conclude that the D500 is the most accomplished crop-sensor camera yet made. Build and handling are exemplary, aided by some well-judged tweaks to the control layout; I particularly appreciated the repositioned ISO button and the joystick AF point selector. Meanwhile, the viewfinder is excellent, and it’s nice to see a tilting rear screen on a camera of this type, although it’s perhaps less useful here than on a mirrorless camera. The addition of 4K video recording will be the icing on the cake for some users, but make no mistake, the D500 shines brightest when it’s used as a conventional DSLR for shooting fast-moving subjects. Indeed, in all the time I’ve spent working with the D500, I’ve been hugely impressed by its ability to pull any shot out of the bag, acquiring focus quickly and confidently no matter how erratically moving the subject or how dim the light. Its excellent high ISO capability means it will deliver entirely usable image files in extremely low light, too. The stumbling block for the Nikon D500. The original price was more than you would have paid for some excellent full-frame cameras, including Nikon’s own D750 , and around $1000 / £1,000 more than the next DX model down – the highly accomplished Nikon D7200 . Indeed, many Nikon users eyeing an upgrade might have been better served by buying a couple of nice Nikkor lenses instead, or upgrading to full frame if they’re looking for improved image quality. For this reason, the D500’s practical appeal was originally limited to those who know for sure that they can make use of its astonishing autofocus system and impressive high ISO image quality, and appreciate the extra effective telephoto reach afforded by the DX sensor. The fact is, the D500 is not so much an expensive APS-C camera as a pro camera with an APS-C sensor. Looked at in those terms, it makes rather more sense, especially with today’s attractive and appealing prices on the secondhand market.
    - type: excerpt
      value: "The Nikon D500 was Nikon’s fastest APS-C Digital SLR, and could be one of the best Nikon DSLRs available for those looking for speed. Find out how it performs in our full review. What is the Nikon D500? The Nikon D500 was Nikon’s fastest, most rugged and most powerful APS-C DSLR. It’s almost impossible to find new these days, but plenty of examples exist on the used market, and it’s possible to get good examples with moderate signs of use and wear for well under $1000 / £1000 – though beware of high shutter counts. So is it still worth buying and spending money on? Although officially discontinued, the D500 is still surprisingly effective, at least for stills photography. Many photographers prefer the optical viewfinder of a DSLR over the EVF of a mirrorless camera, especially for sports photography and high-speed shooting, and the D500’s continuous shooting and professional-level raw buffer capacity are still reasons to consider it today. The D500 is also backed up by a huge range of Nikon DX and FX lenses. Read our guide to The Best Nikon lenses for F-mount for more. Back in 2007, Nikon unleashed a pair of DSLRs that revitalised its line-up and re-established the company as being at least on a par with its rival Canon. The professional-level D3 was its first full-frame model, with super-fast shooting and an impressive 51-point AF system. Meanwhile, the DX-format D300 was very much a D3-lite, offering many of the flagship’s best features in a smaller body at a fraction of the price. It rapidly won the hearts of a generation of serious enthusiast and semi-professional photographers, spurring Canon to produce a capable competitor in the shape of the EOS 7D. The D300 underwent a relatively minor refresh with the D300S in 2009, but after that Nikon seemed to abandon the idea, insisting that its D7000-series of enthusiast-focused DSLRs met the needs of the majority of enthusiasts. But in 2016 Nikon relented and, just in time for a summer of European Championship football and the Olympic Games, produced a genuine successor in the shape of the D500, alongside the professional Nikon D5 , and with an astonishing set of specifications that are still impressive today. These include an extended top ISO of 1.6 million, alongside a 153-point AF system and 10fps continuous burst shooting. On paper, it’s the best APS-C DSLR so far, and with the end of DSLR production it’s not likely to be surpassed. To find out more, see our guide to the best Nikon DSLRs and also the best Nikon F-mount lenses . Of course, the D500 is now competing with mirrorless cameras that can shoot faster bursts, better video and higher resolution stills. Examples include the Fujifilm X-H2S , Canon EOS R7 and OM System OM-1 . So with this in mind, just how good does the Nikon D500 look today? Nikon D500 review – Features A quick glance at the D500’s key specs shows that it’s a remarkably well-featured camera. Its 20.9-million-pixel DX-format sensor affords an impressive standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-51,200 , and a frankly staggering extended range of ISO 50-1,640,000 . It can shoot at 10fps , and keep going for at least 30 frames in raw format and 90 or more in JPEG mode. That’s with an SD card; place an XQD card in the second slot, and it’ll keep shooting at full speed for 200 frames in raw. Since the D500’s launch, the XQD format has practically disappeared, but a subsequent firmware update has made the camera compatible with the newer and now widely used (and physically identical) CFexpress Type B format. The 20.9-megapixel resolution is a small drop from Nikon’s previous 24-megapixel models, but it’s the same resolution as OM System cameras, most Panasonic Lumix models and even the mighty Canon EOS R6 (Mark 1). Autofocus uses a 153-point system covering almost the full width of the frame and around half its height, while metering employs a 180,000 pixel RGB sensor that also feeds subject-recognition data to the AF system. Nikon specifies that both systems will work in staggeringly low light: -3EV for metering, and -4EV for AF. That AF sensitivity, while remarkable for its time and still terrific today, has been improved on by newer mirrorless cameras. The D500 is also capable of recording 4K video , but with the catch that it uses a 1.5x crop in the centre of the frame, compromising wideangle shooting. Full HD movies can be captured at up to 60fps, this time with a recording area the full width of the sensor. But while it has some nice movie-friendly features, including microphone and headphone sockets, and a flat picture profile, there’s no focus-peaking display and only rudimentary zebra pattern overexposure warning. This 1.5x crop in particular limits the Nikon’s appeal for filmmakers. Technically it does shoot 4K, but you would probably choose any one of a dozen modern mirrorless cameras in preference to this one for 4K video. One thing the D500 lacks is a built-in flash, and users will instead have to rely on hotshoe-mounted\
        \ external units. For anyone planning to use Nikon’s excellent wireless flash system this will come as a disappointment, but it reinforces the camera’s positioning as an available light action specialist. Presumably, Nikon believes portrait photographers would be better off with a D750. Nikon D500 review – SnapBridge A new feature that Nikon is trumpeting is its SnapBridge connection to smartphones or tablets. This is designed to get around the limitations of current Wi-Fi implementations by maintaining a permanent connection between the camera and smart device using Bluetooth, switching to the more power-hungry Wi-Fi only when required for transferring high-resolution images or remotely controlling the camera. Part of the idea here is that the camera can automatically transfer every picture you take to your phone (and then to Nikon’s cloud-sharing service, if you like) without needing the Wi-Fi to be turned on all the time. This sounds great, but sadly, at the time of our original review, it didn’t work very well. On Android devices, SnapBridge did function pretty much as advertised, but even a brief play revealed that it was well suited to a high-end camera like the D500. Most obviously, the remote-control app offered no manual settings changes at all – a perplexing oversight at a time when every other brand offers extensive manual control of the camera over Wi-Fi. The connection between the camera and phone is always active, even when the camera’s power switch is set to off. But contrary to the idea of using Bluetooth, this can result in considerable battery drain on the camera even when it is switched off. This can be fixed by switching the camera to its airplane mode, if you can find it in the menu and remember to turn it on. But then the two devices can often fail to re-establish the connection when you need it. Nikon D500 review – Build and handling As we’d expect from a professional sports camera, the D500 gives the impression of being built like a tank. The magnesium-alloy body has a bombproof feel to it, and a well-designed grip means that it fits perfectly in your hand. Almost every square inch of the body is covered by buttons and dials, which give direct access to all the key functions – so much so, that there’s rarely any need to access the menus. Nikon has used broadly the same control layout as that on recent models, such as the D810 , but added a few additional tweaks that \Lcome straight out of the Canon playbook. So at long last there’s a sensibly placed ISO button immediately behind the shutter release, and a joystick for positioning the focus point that sits naturally under your right thumb. Pressing this inwards engages autoexposure lock, and if you prefer using the D-pad to move the focus point, this works, too. The upshot is that the most important settings can all be changed without taking the camera from your eye while you’re shooting. However, those accessed from the cluster on the left-side top-plate – including drive mode, metering, white balance and exposure mode – still require you to remove your left hand from supporting the lens. Nikon also offers a decent level of customisation, so you can reassign various buttons to suit your personal shooting. But to be honest, the basic layout is so well worked out that you might not find much need for this. Unsurprisingly for such a sophisticated camera, the D500’s menus are complex, even for a seasoned user. It’s not necessarily too hard to work out what each option does when browsing through them at leisure, but trying to find and change any specific setting in a hurry is a real trial. Because of this, it makes a lot of sense to place your most needed functions in the customisable My Menu once you get to know the camera. It’s worth mentioning one thing that has become apparent with the rise of mirrorless cameras. It’s true that the D500 is bigger and bulkier by comparison, but for sports and wildlife fans using longer lenses, this can actually make it better balanced and easier to handle. Many mirrorless cameras suffer from having a small body married up to big lenses. Nikon D500 review – Viewfinder and screen Without doubt, the D500’s optical viewfinder is one of the best we’ve seen on an APS-C DSLR. With a magnification of 1.0x and 100% coverage of the image area, it’s certainly the largest, and not far off full-frame DSLRs or the electronic viewfinders on high-end mirrorless cameras in terms of size. It doesn’t have all the clever viewfinder information overlays that Canon has included on its EOS 7D Mark II , but you do get to see all the core exposure data along with gridlines and a twin-axis electronic level. Unfortunately, this is usually displayed in black, so it can be difficult to discern while shooting. The 2.36-million-dot rear screen is superb – it’s impressively detailed, while giving accurate colour rendition. Its ability to tilt 90° upwards or downwards can be handy in some situations for shooting from odd angles,\
        \ although it’s difficult to get away from the fact that the D500 is vastly more competent when you’re using the viewfinder, compared to shooting in live view. Nikon has made the screen touch-sensitive, but kept the touch functionality to a minimum. You can select the focus point by touch in live view and movie modes, release the shutter and browse images in playback. But you can’t use the screen to browse menus or change any settings. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but would certainly count as nice to have, especially for video use. Nikon D500 review – Autofocus At the D500’s heart is its 153-point autofocus system, which is very similar to that used in the flagship D5. Indeed, it’s the camera’s raison d’être, with Nikon aiming to give photographers a significant fraction of the D5’s capabilities in a smaller, cheaper package. The first thing you notice on looking through the viewfinder is the huge spread of those focus points, covering the full width of the frame and a significant fraction of its height. It’s not quite the whole-frame coverage that we’ve become used to from mirrorless cameras, but it’s significantly greater than what you’ll get from any other DSLR. Nikon has recognised that navigating so many focus points would be impractical, so it has limited the user-selectable array to 55, with the remainder employed to assist focus tracking on moving subjects. Indeed, these are so densely packed that there’s little chance of your subject drifting into an area that’s not covered. If the subject is static, then you can shoot with either a single point or a group of points, which can be helpful with some subjects to avoid focusing on the background. For continuous focus on a moving subject, you have a number of extra options to choose from. Dynamic group mode is most effective when you know roughly where the subject will be in the frame; you can instruct the camera to use 25, 72, or all 153 focus points to maintain focus. Alternatively, in 3D tracking mode the camera uses all 153 points to follow the subject as it moves around the frame, with the 180,000-pixel metering sensor feeding information to help the camera keep track of your main subject. There’s little doubt that the D500, alongside the D5, represents current state-of-the-art autofocus and subject tracking, keeping your subject sharp with uncanny ease, no matter how it moves around. If this is something you need – for sports, wildlife, or simply taking pictures of erratically moving kids – no other camera is likely to do it as well, let alone better. Switch the camera to live view, though, and its AF speed falls off a cliff. Its contrast-detection system is tolerable for handheld shooting, but it’s not a patch on the lightning-fast systems on modern mirrorless cameras. The Nikon D780 was the first and only Nikon DSLR to offer on-sensor phase-detect AF, but it looks unlikely that Nikon will release another. However, the D500’s live view does at least benefit from the inherent accuracy of contrast-detection AF, especially when using fast lenses to shoot off-centre subjects. Nikon D500 review – Performance When it comes to metering, four patterns are available – matrix, centreweighted, spot and highlight weighted. The default matrix system is very strongly biased towards ‘correct’ exposure of whatever is under the active AF area, regardless of whether this suits the scene as a whole. This approach has it merits, but does have a certain tendency to clip highlights in high-contrast scenes. In such situations I appreciated having the highlight-weighted option which, as its name suggests, aims to maintain highlight detail, allowing you to bring up shadow regions in post-processing. In this regard, raw files are remarkably malleable at low-ISO sensitivities, and it’s possible to pull vast amounts of detail out of the shadows without it being blighted by excessive noise. JPEG shooters can use Nikon’s Active D-Lighting feature to make similar use of the sensor’s superb dynamic range. Auto white balance tends to give extremely neutral results – indeed, too much for my tastes. For example, it’s prone to removing attractive warm casts from sunlit scenes, and I usually preferred to add back a little warmth to my images in post-processing. But while the AWB setting can be changed in the menu to retain warmth under artificial light, there’s no such option for daylight shooting. Nikon’s colour rendition is generally very appealing, giving rich, saturated colours without going over the top. The output \Lcan be adjusted from the Picture Control menu using a range of subject-based settings, all of which can be individually fine-tuned. Sports and action shooters are likely to spend a lot of time using JPEGs, so it’s good to see that Nikon offers high-quality results straight from the camera. Overall image quality is very good, but then again the same is true of much cheaper Nikon APS-C DSLRs. Indeed, at low ISOs there’s no real advantage in this area compared to\
        \ the D7200 or indeed the D5500. But the D500 keeps going longer as the ISO is raised, and so long as you don’t expect miracles, it’s still capable of giving quite usable files at its top standard setting of ISO 51,200, and maybe even a stop higher. However, I can’t help but think that the extended settings exist more for marketing value than practical use. Nikon D500 review – Dynamic range, resolution and noise Nikon used a 20.9-million-pixel DX-format sensor in the D500, and it delivers impressive image quality. It’s lower in resolution than Nikon’s cheaper DX DSLRs, which sport 24-million-pixel sensors, but the difference is less than 10% in terms of linear resolution, and I suspect it will be easy to accept this compromise in return for the D500’s other considerable skills. More to the point, high ISO performance is very good indeed, with the top standard sensitivity of ISO 51,200 giving remarkably respectable results. Unfortunately, though, the extended settings do seem to be hugely over-optimistic; anyone expecting usable ISO 1,638,400 from a DX sensor will need to wait a little longer. Dynamic range When it comes to dynamic range, the D500 scores remarkably well in our Applied Imaging tests. At ISO 50 we have a dynamic range of over 13EV, indicating massive leeway for recovering additional details from raw files, especially in shadow regions. This drops only slowly up to ISO 800, but beyond this the curve tails off more rapidly. Even so, values of 8.3EV at ISO 6,400 and 6EV at ISO 51,200 represent a remarkably strong showing for this size of sensor. But the precipitous decline in the extended settings indicates why these have limited practical use. Resolution The D500 captures as much from our resolution charts as we could realistically expect from its 20.9MP sensor. At low ISOs in raw it resolves around 3,700l/ph before maze-like aliasing comes into play; the JPEG processing tends to suppress such artefacts at the expense of slightly lower resolution. But what’s more impressive is its high ISO capability, with 3,000l/ph still recorded at ISO 6,400. At the highest standard setting of ISO 51,200, it achieves 2,600l/ph, but past this things go downhill quickly. Even at ISO 204,800, we see around 2,000l/ph, but the higher extended settings are too poor to be worth reproducing here. Noise Both raw and JPEG images taken from our diorama scene are captured at the full range of ISO settings. The camera is placed in its default setting for JPEG images. Raw images are sharpened and noise reduction applied, to strike the best balance between resolution and noise. At low ISO sensitivities, the D500’s image quality is superb; fine detail is rendered with impressive sharpness thanks to the lack of an optical low-pass filter , and there’s no visible noise. At ISO 800 a little luminance noise becomes visible, and shadow details start to disappear. ISO 1,600 is still eminently usable, but by the time we hit ISO 6,400 fine detail and colour saturation are visibly suffering. By ISO 51,200, colour rendition becomes very broad-brush, but the image is still entirely recognisable and should be perfectly usable with careful processing from raw; this is pretty impressive coming from an APS-C-format sensor. However, at the extended higher sensitivity settings, it’s increasingly difficult to see the point as the image disappears progressively under an ocean of noise."

    - type: conclusion
      value: Nikon users had a long three-year wait for a replacement to the mighty D810, but the great news is that the D850 doesn’t disappoint in the slightest, delivering impressive features by the truck load. Professionals, semi-professionals and serious enthusiasts who settle for it be thunderstruck, even now, by the performance of the new 45.7-million-pixel full-frame (FX-format) CMOS sensor, particularly its low-light capabilities at high ISO. Nikon is well aware that a professional DSLR needs more than a high resolution and excellent noise response to satisfy photographers in their droves, and by successfully marrying high resolution with high speed they’ve made the D850 one of the most versatile DSLRs around. For anyone who carries a D810 for high-resolution shooting and a D500 for fast action work, for example, the D850 is capable of replacing both in a single body. The only thing to factor in here is that you will require the MB-D18 battery grip and EN-EL18b battery to shoot at 9fps, which adds considerably to the body-only price. It’s not just the speed and the way the D850 is capable of processing such high volumes of data so quickly that impresses, either, as the AF response is as good as you get on the flagship Nikon D5. It’s insanely accurate and responsive, even when challenged with the fastest subjects and poorest of lighting conditions. Other attractive features are its tilting touchscreen and impressive video capabilities, although I do feel that both of these areas could have been made better by offering touch control of key exposure variables and implementing a faster live view focusing system. The only other disappointment was SnapBridge connectivity, which didn’t perform faultlessly and wasn’t always reliable at transmitting images to my mobile device as they were taken. There’s no question that the D850 deserves to be taken seriously even now, because it’s going to appeal to so many users, from action, sports and wildlife photographers to landscape , portrait , wedding, architectural and still-life photographers. Not everyone enjoys the handling of mirrorless cameras or the electronic viewing experience, and for those that still prefer the DSLR design, the D850 is an extremely compelling alternative, especially at today’s prices. If DSLRs like the D850 are a dying breed, then you should get it while you still can!
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Nikon D850 is Nikon’s highest resolution full-frame DSLR, with a 45.7MP sensor, and exceptional build quality, making it a tough DSLR to beat. It’s considered by many to be Nikon’s best DSLR ever released. Find out why in our full review: What is the Nikon D850? Nikon wetted the appetite of many photographers back in 2017 with news that it was working on a follow-up to its high-resolution full-frame D810 in the form of the Nikon D850. A lot has happened since then, so is the Nikon D850 still the ground-breaking camera it was at launch, and can it still compete today? When the wraps finally came off the D850, it struck up a similar level of hype to the company’s announcements of its high resolution D800 and D800E twins back in 2012. It was expected that the resolution would exceed the 36 megapixels offered by the D800/D800E and D810 – but what wasn’t so clear were Nikon’s plans to radically increase shooting speed, boost the sensitivity range and add a whole host of other improvements. In the past, high-speed shooting and an outstanding noise response have been compromises you’ve had to make for choosing a super-high-resolution DSLR. This is the reason that so many professionals carry around a model that’s good for shooting at high speed and another that excels at high resolution; there’s never been the perfect hybrid. Nikon’s answer was the D850, which set its sights on being the perfect all-rounder. Since then we’ve had a series of mirrorless cameras that achieve a similar blend of features, but the D850 was the first. To read more about Nikon’s mirrorless Z system, head to our Best Nikon Mirrorless Cameras article. On paper, the Nikon D850 has a jaw-dropping spec that’s tailored for almost any subject or situation. It can still be picked up new for around $3,595 / £2,799, while there are also many used examples available on the secondhand market. Purchase one in ‘excellent’ used condition with a shutter count of around 40k frames and you’ll be spending in the region of £1,649. Heavily used examples can be picked up for under £1,499, but these typically have much higher shutter counts closer to 100k frames. It’s true that mirrorless cameras have come to dominate the market since the D850’s launch, but this is a big, sturdy, ultra-high resolution camera that still has a lot to offer, especially for those who prefer optical viewfinders and cameras with a bit of heft. It’s perhaps no exaggeration to say that the D850 is approaching cult camera status as the high water mark of DSLR image quality and performance. DSLRs still have many fans, and you can find out more about the Nikon DSLR ecosystem in our guides to the best Nikon DSLRs and best Nikon F-mount lenses . Nikon D850 – Features Inside the Nikon D850 is what was then an all-new 45.7-megapixel full-frame (FX-format) CMOS sensor , which does away with an optical low-pass filter. It packs gapless on-chip micro-lenses, with a backside-illuminated architecture to maximise its light-gathering capabilities. Where the D810 could shoot natively between ISO 64-12,800 (expandable to ISO 32-51,200), the D850 offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 64-25,600, expandable to ISO 32-102,400 . Nikon has paired this new sensor with the same Expeed 5 image processor seen in its flagship D5. This helps to bring continuous shooting speed up to a healthy 7fps , and there’s the option to boost this to 9fps with the MB-D18 grip ($397 / £389) and EN-EL18 high-power battery. At 7fps the D850 has a 51-frame raw buffer , and with an XQD card slot languishing next to an UHS-II compatible SD card slot, it offers good prospects for sports and action photographers who demand nothing but the fastest read/write speeds. The XQD format was a pretty short-lived storage medium, but it’s physically identical to the newer and widely used CFexpress Type B format, and a subsequent firmware update has made the D850 CFexpress-compatible. The D850 also inherits Nikon’s best DSLR autofocus system – again lifted directly from the D5. It sports 153 focus points (of which 55 are user-selectable), including 99 of the more accurate cross-type, and 15 that will work with lens and teleconverter combinations with an aperture of f/8. The centre point is sensitive to -4EV, and the rest to -3EV, allowing the camera to focus quickly in low light. Autofocus modes include auto area, 3D colour tracking, single point AF and the option to select the number of continuous (AF-C) focus points from a group of 9,25,72 or 153. In Live View, there’s a new pinpoint AF mode that’s designed to ease precise focusing on smaller subjects in the frame, but without on-chip phase detection, Nikon is still relying entirely on contrast detection for autofocus. This is a key point to keep in mind with DSLRs – they effectively have two AF systems; one for viewfinder shooting and another for live view. Metering is left in the capable hands of the manufacturer’s 180,00-pixel RGB sensor – yet another feature inherited
        from the D5. As we’ve seen before, it’s this metering sensor that’s used for subject-recognition purposes including face detection, which feeds information to the AF system for accurate and precise subject tracking. If you’re worried about how quickly the D850 might clog up storage devices with its huge 8256 x 5504 pixel files, fear not. Nikon has added two reduced image size options when recording in Raw or JPEG. Change the image size from large to medium and the D850 will record 25.6-megapixel files (6192 x 4128 pixels), with the small setting reducing the resolution to 11.4-megapixel files (4128 x 2752 pixels). Subsequent launches, such as the Panasonic Lumix S1R and Sony A1 and A7R V have made these ultra-high resolutions mainstream, so by now most users will have storage setups and computer hardware that can cope. In addition, the D850 has a DX Crop mode. This is automatically selected by the camera when a DX lens is attached, but can be used in combination with FX lenses for those who’d like to gain more reach at the telephoto end. It may use a small area of the D850’s sensor, but still produces adequate resolution (19.4 megapixels) with a 5408 x 3600 pixel count. To put this into perspective, the resolution produced in the D850’s DX Crop mode doesn’t fall far behind the 20.9-megapixel resolution produced by the Nikon D7500 and D500 . On the video side of things, the D850 is capable of in-camera 4K recording at 30fps using the full width of the sensor. 4K time-lapse movies can also be generated in-camera, but strangely, the only feature Nikon chose to reveal early – 8K time-lapse – can’t. This requires the use of third-party software. A more accurate description would have been to say the camera has a built-in intervalometer. Videographers will also be pleased to receive aids such as a peaking display for accurate manual focus, and zebra patterns to help avoid overexposure. Both microphone and headphone sockets are built in and are located above the USB and Type-C HDMI interfaces. By current mirrorless standards, the D850’s video specifications are pretty ordinary, but it’s still an effective video camera for more considered filming setups (not vlogging ) and shouldn’t be underestimated. Elsewhere, there’s new in-camera focus bracketing to create extended depth-of-field composites, as well as a new Natural Light Auto White Balance option, which promises optimal results in outdoor lighting. Hopefully, this should tackle Nikon’s favouritism to over-neutralise outdoor shots to give them more warmth. Other impressive features are found on the rear of the camera. The optical viewfinder is the largest yet seen on a Nikon DSLR, with a 0.75x magnification; below it sits a 2.36m-dot LCD that tilts up and down. It’s similar to the D500’s screen and fully supports touch functionality, allowing you to navigate menus, browse images in playback or set the AF point in Live View. The camera is powered by Nikon’s familiar EN-EL15 battery, but what’s particularly impressive here is that it can be used to shoot 1840 shots on a single charge – a big jump from the 1200-shot stamina of the Nikon D810. As we’ve seen before, the D850 gets Nikon’s SnapBridge connectivity as a means of wirelessly moving images to mobile devices. Images can be transferred as you shoot, and selecting the all-important down-sampling 2-megapixel mode rapidly speeds up transfer times and saves on valuable storage space. Nikon D850 – Body and design Professional full-frame DSLRs have to be built like tanks if they’re to be robust enough to put up with the rigours of daily use. The D850 is no exception and Nikon has once again produced an incredibly strong camera that feels superbly constructed, albeit with a few subtle body changes over the D810. To give it its strength and rigidity, the camera is built around a magnesium alloy chassis. It’s fully weather-sealed to prevent moisture, dust and dirt penetrating through the body seams and damaging the internals. Nikon has also taken the decision to remove the pop-up flash – something that was useful on the D810 to trigger off-camera flash, but isn’t found on many of today’s most resilient, professional DSLRs. From the front, the D850 doesn’t appear all that different from the D810. However, when you get it in your hands you’ll notice that the grip has been reworked and made a fraction deeper. It will accommodates the largest of hands extremely well and your index finger is left to rest comfortably on the shutter button. Comfort and a good feel are key factors for any serious photographer who will often spend hours at a time with camera in hand. It’s here that the D850 really excels, to the point I’d say it’s one of the most comfortable pro DSLRs I’ve used over prolonged spells of shooting. This is perhaps one of the areas where an old-school DSLR still has an advantage over newer but smaller mirrorless rivals. Spin the camera round in your hands and you’ll find every inch of the body is covered in
        buttons, dials or connector ports, with sufficient dedicated controls to change every key shooting setting without needing to access the menus. In terms of button layout, there are a few nice touches. For example, there’s a new joystick that falls naturally under your thumb for shifting the focus point around the frame on the fly. It’s faster than using the four-way controller and its knurled texture helps you identify it from the AF-ON button. Nikon’s decision to put the ISO button above the drive mode dial on the D810 was always a curious one, so it’s good to see this being exchanged with the mode button. In use it means sensitivity can now be changed without having to pull your eye away from the viewfinder. At the rear you get the usual menu, lock, playback zoom and OK buttons parallel to the left of the screen, but there’s also a new customisable Fn2 button in the bottom corner that’s brilliant for rating images in playback. It can also be setup to access My Menu and toggle between stills and movie shooting info in Live View. The integrated Live View button and stills/movie switch has shifted down and the info button is useful for viewing key exposure settings on-screen. Nikon users coming from the D800, D800E or D810 will quickly become familiar with the changes to the body. It should also be said that other Nikon users coming from less advanced APS-C models shouldn’t find the D850 bewildering, and can use their good knowledge of Nikon’s menu system to setup and navigate the camera easily. If all the above wasn’t enough, the D850 has a few other nice touches. Flicking the on/off switch to its bulb position illuminates the top-plate LCD as well as many of the buttons across the body, which can make all the difference when shooting in the dark. In addition, there’s a clever folding port cover that allows you to keep the headphone socket fully protected from the elements when a microphone is plugged in. Nikon D850 – Silent shooting We’ve seen Nikon attempt to quieten its DSLRs in the past by adding shooting modes that effectively dampen the sound of mirror slap. The D850 is equipped with two such modes (one offering 3fps continuous shooting) and both can be found from the drive mode dial on the top corner of the body. Although these modes do suppress the sound of the shutter a little, mirror slap is still audible. To go one better, Nikon has introduced a silent, zero-vibration electronic shutter to the D850 that enables users to capture images in complete silence when using Live View. Users are given two silent Live View modes to choose from in the photo shooting menu. Mode 1 offers silent shooting at 6fps at full resolution including Raw, whereas Mode 2 rattles out 8-megapixel shots at 30fps in the JPEG format only. This new way of shooting will be well received, particularly by wedding and wildlife photographers who are often at risk of frightening or disturbing their subjects in quiet environments. I tested both modes at a church wedding, and those around me were completely oblivious to the fact I was capturing images throughout the service. It’s a boon for those times when you want to be discreet and work under the radar. Now, of course, silent shooting is a staple feature of mirrorless cameras like the Nikon Z7 II and Nikon Z8 , but many might be surprised to learn that a DSLR behemoth like the D850 can do it too. Nikon D850 – Viewfinder and screen One of the constraints of the Nikon D810 was that it had a fixed screen. After years of waiting it’s good to finally see Nikon embracing a tilting touchscreen on one of its high-resolution pro-spec DSLRs. The screen is essentially the same 2.36m-dot LCD that you get on the D500. It tilts up and down for waist-level shooting, but isn’t as ingenious as the screen you get on the Fujifilm X-T2 and later models in that it constrains you to shooting in landscape rather than portrait format too. The angle of tilt is particularly good for low- and high-angle shooting. It goes one better than the D500’s screen, too, in the way the touchscreen can now be used to browse menus and change menu settings. You can’t change exposure variables from the info display or Live View screen, but it offers a big step in the right direction. As for its response, it’s incredibly sensitive and precise to the touch, rivalling the response of Canon’s superb touchscreens. The viewfinder is equally as impressive as the screen. It doesn’t offer a preview of white balance, exposure or depth of field in the way of an electronic viewfinder, but with its 0.75x magnification and 100% frame coverage it offers a very pleasing view when raised to the eye. It’s possible to turn on a viewfinder grid display, and I found myself assigning the Fn1 button to viewfinder virtual horizon, which loads a helpful levelling guide on the horizontal and vertical axis to avoid skewed shots. Being the optical type the viewfinder has zero lag, incredibly short blackout time, and there’s the option to block out
        the viewfinder to prevent any light leak problems during long exposures. Nikon D850 – Autofocus Nikon’s professional DSLR’s have long had a good reputation for putting in fast and accurate focusing performances. The D850 is no exception, and with the same Multi-CAM 20K autofocus sensor module seen in Nikon’s flagship D5, it can be relied upon to acquire focus faster than you thought possible. This is most impressive in very poor lighting conditions. Dimly lit dance floors at wedding venues and low-light wildlife shots are just a couple of examples where I found the capabilities of the D850’s autofocus system excelled beyond my expectations. I experienced no difficultly at all tracking moving subjects travelling directly towards the camera, even in fading light. A quick fire burst of 18 frames at 7fps set to continuous AF (AF-C) resulted in just three frames of a train travelling towards the camera in excess of 60mph not being perfectly pin-sharp. The 55 user-selectable points are expanded relative to the D810, but they’re still grouped towards the centre of the frame, meaning there may be the odd occasion when your subject is positioned in an area of the frame where you need to focus first and then recompose. In similar fashion to other Nikon DSLRs, the AF is changed between single (AF-S) and continuous (AF-C) modes by pressing the AF button located inside the AF/MF switch and turning the rear dial. Holding down the button and turning the front dial controls the number of points in use in AF-C mode and is also used to select 3D AF tracking. From the Autofocus custom setting menu you can refine AF settings to suit your way of shooting. For example, you can speed up or slow down the blocked shot AF response, and tell the camera whether you’re shooting an erratic or steady-moving subject from the Focus tracking with lock-on settings. Users are given the option to reduce the number of selectable AF points from 55 to 15, and back button focusing is easy enough to setup from the AF activation sub menu. Nikon D850 – Performance Being such a versatile camera, I found myself shooting a wide range of subjects in many different environments to find out how the D850 performs. First, I used the camera to shoot a series of landscapes and quickly found myself blown away by the astonishing detail the sensor resolves. The marriage of high resolution, fast focus speed and tilt-angle screen allowed me to capture shots bursting with detail from low-angles – far easier than any previous high resolution DSLR Nikon has produced. The crystal-clear rear display, with its responsive touch control and accurate colour rendition, is excellent for monitoring results. I regularly used the double-tap function combined with the rear dial to quickly zoom into 100% and check focus between shots. Even if you’re not overly keen on the idea of using a touchscreen on a DSLR, the D850’s is so good you’re likely to use it more than you think, especially to navigate the menu. Testing the D850 at a wedding produced a pleasing set of results with two of my favourite Sigma Art lenses – the 24-35mm f/2 DG HSM Art and 135mm f/1.8 DG HSM. The true test was its silent Live View mode, where I opted for Mode 1 ahead of Mode 2 to prioritise resolution ahead of speed. While it’s great that the D850 can capture shots without trace of a sound, you’re still totally reliant on contrast-detection for autofocus in Live View, both when shooting stills and video. I did find myself missing a few key shots where the D850 struggled to lock on fast enough, at which point I reverted to phase-detection focusing and composing via the viewfinder at the cost of louder operation. The D850 can’t quite reach the heights of Canon’s EOS 5D Mark IV , which benefits from on-chip phase detection in Live View thanks to its Dual Pixel AF technology. However, the disadvantage of the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV is that it doesn’t offer a completely silent shooting mode in Live View like the D850. To test the D850’s speed capabilities I used it on a car shoot – hanging out the back of a car to get a series of action shots. Without the MB-D18 grip and EN-EL18 high-power battery I was limited to shooting at 7fps, but the AF system proved more than capable of tracking the car, delivering pin-sharp results frame after frame. However, I did notice that shooting in Raw and Fine JPEG formats at full resolution only gave me around 400 shots or so to play with using a SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB card. If you’re going to shoot at the highest quality at the highest speed on the D850 then you’ll not only need a few high-capacity cards, you’ll need the best quality cards too. I managed to shoot 20 continuous frames (Raw and Fine JPEG) at full resolution at 7fps to my card before the buffer was reached. To get anywhere close to the promised 51-frame raw buffer – and reach the full potential of the D850’s speed capabilities – you’ll be required to use the finest UHS-II SD cards or XQD cards. Just as my time
        with the camera came to an end, I managed to source a Sony 64GB XQD card. In real-world use I found I was recording around 40 (14-bit lossless compressed) Raw files at 7fps before its buffer was reached. This is an impressive number considering the vast volume of data it was being asked to process and write. Formatting the card and switching to 12-bit lossless compressed Raw saw the number of continuously recorded frames increase to 107 at 7fps. As for Nikon’s wireless connectivity, I found the camera would automatically pair and connect to my iPhone via Bluetooth without issue. However, it wouldn’t always send my latest shots to my mobile device straight away when the auto-link within the app was clearly switched on. It seemed completely random as to when new photos would be transferred from the camera. To overcome this I ended up using the Download Selected Pictures option, which initiates a Wi-Fi connection with the camera. Then, I manually selected the images I wanted to wirelessly transfer to my camera roll before sharing. Having the option to select the shots you’d like to import at 2MB or full resolution is great in this part of the app, but overall I was left with the impression that SnapBridge could be made more intuitive to use. The fact it doesn’t offer the option to change exposure settings live in Remote Shooting mode also puts it way behind other apps from rival manufacturers. Nikon D850 – Video The D850 is capable of producing excellent movie footage in the hands of a videographer. It’s capable of in-camera 4K recording (3840 x 2160) at 30fps and Full HD (1920 x 1080) at up to 60fps for a maximum record time of 29mins 59secs. If you’re looking for more tips and advice on how to record and edit video with a DSLR like the Nikon D850, don’t miss our detailed guide to Making a video with your camera . For cinematographers, the feature that sets the D850 apart from other DSLRs is its 4K and 8K time-lapse capabilities. The time-lapse movie and intervalometer settings are easy enough to get your head around, offering advanced options such as being able to turn on silent shooting and exposure smoothing. Once you’ve setup the interval and shooting time, you get a visual of how much space the time-lapse is going to take up on your SD or XQD card, as well as the indicated length of the time-lapse once complete. It’s simply a matter of hitting start to commence a 4K time-lapse. However, it’s worth noting that those who’d like to generate an 8K time-lapse will need to shoot in Raw and run the files through a third-party program since this can’t be done in-camera. Creating high-resolution time-lapse footage is rather draining on the battery, so the MB-D18 grip and EN-EL18 high-power battery are recommended if you’re going to use this functionality regularly. Nikon D850 – Image quality The increase to 45.7 megapixels sees the D850 yield a slightly higher resolution than 42.4-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor found in the Sony A7R II and A7R III but it isn’t quite as high as the 50.6-megapixel resolution offered by Canon’s EOS 5DS and EOS 5DS R twins. With its lack of optical low-pass filter, the sensor produces a sensational level of detail, with great scope for cropping and maintaining high resolution when required. Since the D850’s launch, the Sony A1 and A7R IV and A7R V have offered higher resolutions still, but the increases are incremental, and the D850 still belongs to the ‘ultra-high resolution’ club. Despite the sensor being densely packed with pixels, it offers wide dynamic range leverage and allows users to return a high level of shadow detail to Raw files with minimal noise. Pushing the D850’s sensitivity to its extremes reveals that ISO 6400 is usable, and the same can be said for ISO 12,800 with some vigilant noise reduction applied in post. Resolution The D850 resolves such a high level of detail that it was necessary to shoot our resolution chart from double the distance to determine our results. The sensor resolves 4800l/ph at ISO 100 – a sensational figure that it manages to maintain up to ISO 400. Beyond this point it drops a little to a very respectable 4400l/ph at ISO 800 and 4000l/ph at ISO 1600. The sensor showed no problem resolving 3600l/ph at ISO 6400, with a slightly lower 3200l/ph figure being recorded at both ISO 12,800 and ISO 25,600. Detail starts to tail off more beyond this point as noise becomes ever more prevalent at higher sensitivity settings. Noise To produce the best results at high ISO, you’ll want to shoot in Raw. However, I was left impressed by the in-camera processing that’s applied to the D850’s JPEG images, with fine detail being well preserved up to ISO 12,800. A close examination of raw files revealed noise-free results between ISO 100-800, with trace luminance noise starting to creep in at ISO 1600. ISO 3200 and ISO 6400 are perfectly usable, and I wouldn’t fear pushing to ISO 12,800 – just beware that shots taken at this setting will require some noise reduction
        applied during processing. I noticed a drop in saturation beginning at ISO 25,600, and noise becomes so imposing at ISO 51,200 and ISO 102,400 that you’ll want to avoid these settings at all costs. Whereas ISO 3200-6400 was the limit at which I’d want to shoot at with the D810, I wouldn’t be too fearful of pushing to ISO 12,800 on the D850 if there’s no other option.'

      value: This unique DSLR might just make Pentax users fall in love with black & white all over again. Andy Westlake takes a close-up look at the Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome
    - type: conclusion
      value: For anyone else, though, I’m not so sure. While $2200 / £2249 is a dramatically lower price for a specialist mono camera than Leica’s offerings, I just don’t think the K-3 Mark III Monochrome has the same aspirational appeal. A chunky APS-C DSLR simply isn’t the same object of desire as a beautiful minimalist rangefinder, and it doesn’t offer such a special shooting experience, either. If we were looking at a compact, tactile full-frame DSLR that could use all those film-era K-mount lenses without cropping, it might be a different matter. This, in turn, highlights another elephant in the room. If you’re a Pentax user who wants black & white files with higher resolution and lower noise than the K-3 Mark III, why not just buy the full-frame Pentax K-1 Mark II instead, which costs rather less at $2000 / £1699? You could put the extra money towards a lens or two. Meanwhile, anyone else who wants to learn how to shoot in black & white could buy a mirrorless camera, switch to B&W mode, and get a live preview in the viewfinder of how their images will turn out in the absence of colour. I don’t want to sound too critical of the Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome, though. It’s still a fine camera that succeeds on its own terms, and I was pleased by the image files it gave me. It’s also great to see a company other than Leica proving the advantages of the monochrome sensor; I just wish more would follow.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Two years ago, Ricoh Imaging released the Pentax K-3 Mark III, a high-end APS-C DSLR aimed squarely at enthusiast photographers. It turned out to be a very capable camera indeed, combining fine handling, robust build, and impressive image quality to make it one of the best Pentax DSLRs ever. Now the firm has decided to do something more left-field and produce a version that only shoots in black & white – the aptly named Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome . Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome at a glance: This isn’t the first black & white only camera we’ve seen, but it’s the first not to originate from the hallowed halls of Leica, and the first DSLR, too. While it commands a premium over the stock Pentax K-3 Mark III , at $2200 / £2249 rather than $2000 / £1899 body-only, it’s dramatically cheaper than either of Leica’s current offerings, the Leica Q2 Monochrom ($6200 / £5200) and Leica M11 Monochrom ($9200 / £8300). It’s still not quite a camera for the masses, but it makes the idea of a dedicated mono-only tool more accessible than ever before. Of course, you can convert any colour photo to black & white, so it’s perfectly reasonable to ask why you’d use a specialist camera instead. The most obvious reason is technical. With the usual colour filter array eliminated, and no demosaicing process required to create the final image, each sensor pixel directly measures the light intensity at its location – no more, no less. In principle, this should result in sharper detail , smoother tonality , and lower noise . As we’ve seen from those Leicas, monochrome sensors deliver lovely image files. However, there’s another, more subtle argument too. By eliminating any possibility of producing colour images, the camera forces you to think purely in terms of light and tone . So by focusing your mindset while shooting, it might just help you to make better black & white photographs. But does this unique DSLR deliver on its promise? Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome: Features In most respects, the Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome is identical to its parent camera. However, with the colour filter array removed, more light is able to reach the sensor. This results in the only obvious change of specification, with the lowest available sensitivity increasing from ISO 100 to ISO 200 . A close look at the menus and settings reveals that, unsurprisingly, everything relating to white balance or colour output has also been removed. Externally, all the buttons and dials are now marked in grey, rather than white, while the onscreen user interface is almost entirely monochrome. But that’s about the full extent of the differences. In other respects, we get all the same features as the standard K-3 Mark III. This means the camera is built around a 26MP APS-C sensor that employs a backside-illuminated design to reduce noise and improve dynamic range. Its sensitivity stretches all the way up to ISO 1,600,000 and with any luck, it should give much better results that the colour sensor at such super-high settings. For continuous shooting, the promised speed of 12 frames per second is impressive for a DSLR that has to flip its mirror up and down, while the 32-frame raw buffer is very respectable, too. Autofocus utilises a SAFOX 13 sensor, which includes no fewer than 101 focus points, of which 25 are cross-type and 41 are user-selectable. The camera is claimed to be capable of focusing in light as low as -4 EV, while a 307,000-pixel metering sensor aids with subject identification for focus tracking purposes. Switch to live view, though, and the camera falls back onto a contrast-detection AF system, which feels distinctly outdated compared to the on-sensor phase detection now found on almost all mirrorless cameras. For composition, you get the largest viewfinder ever seen on an APS-C DSLR, with its 0.7x equivalent magnification providing a similar size view to most full-frame models. However, this is slightly tempered by the fact that several high-end APS-C mirrorless cameras boast electronic viewfinders that are even larger. On the back you get a 3.2in touchscreen that is fixed, rather than articulated, which these days is unusual (and disappointing). Five-axis in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) is built in and works with almost any lens you can use, promising up to 5.5 stops shake reduction. The system also offers some useful features that are exclusive to Pentax. It can simulate the effect of an optical low-pass filter in suppressing sampling artefacts, automatically correct angled horizons (which is really useful for hand-held shooting), and be used to fine-tune your composition when using a tripod. However, the K-3 Mark III’s pixel-shift multi-shot function has gone, as Pentax only uses this for full-colour sampling at each pixel location. Files are recorded to dual SD card slots , one of which supports high-speed UHS-II media. The two cards can either be used sequentially, or in backup mode with files stored to both. Alternatively, it’s
        possible to send raw files to one card and JPEGs to the other. Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are included for smartphone connectivity , which utilises the free Image Sync app. This provides a conventional set of features, allowing remote control of the camera from your phone either with or without a live view feed, and facilitating image sharing on social media. It’s also possible to geotag your images using your phone’s GPS. A nicely implemented in-camera raw converter allows you to experiment with different processing effects before sharing your photos. The camera is capable of recording 4K video , complete with built-in microphone and headphone sockets for capturing and monitoring higher-quality sound. However, the fixed screen, contrast-detect autofocus, and lack of advanced video features limit the camera’s capabilities in this regard. Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome key features: Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome: Build and Handling Pentax DSLRs have traditionally been extremely well-built , and the K-3 Mark III Monochrome is no different. Its robust magnesium alloy body is dustproof and weather resistant, and certainly feels like it should withstand plenty of abuse. The dials all have textured rubber grips, while the buttons are large and have decent travel, which makes the camera reasonably easy to use while wearing gloves. Existing K-3 Mark III owners will find an identical control layout , with dual control dials at the front and back used to change shutter speed and aperture respectively, and a pair of buttons behind the shutter release for ISO and exposure compensation. The power switch encircles the shutter button; pulling it to a sprung position beyond the On mark stops down the aperture for depth-of-field preview. A prominent dial beside the viewfinder selects between viewfinder, live view and movie shooting. A conventional exposure mode dial is positioned on the camera’s left shoulder. In addition to the usual set of PASM modes, this includes Pentax’s signature TAv and Sv options. The former allows you to specify both the shutter speed and aperture, with the camera adjusting the ISO to compensate, while the latter does precisely the opposite. In Program mode, spinning the front or rear dial allows you to temporarily select a specific shutter speed or aperture respectively for a sequence of shots, which is more sophisticated and useful than the usual program shift function. There’s also a Smart Function (S.Fn) dial on the top, which can be used to change five user-defined functions, selected using the S.Fn button alongside. I generally used it for ISO control, but other options include exposure compensation, drive mode, or quickly switching between autofocus set-ups optimised for static and moving subjects. A joystick on the back is used for positioning the focus point. However, unlike with other cameras, it isn’t fully integrated into the rest of the interface. For example, it can’t be used to scroll through images in playback, or to navigate menus and change settings. Instead, it will often push you back into shooting mode. Meanwhile, the d-pad buttons are dedicated to changing drive mode, LCD brightness, and image processing settings. For the latter, the camera offers a choice of Standard, Hard, and Soft monochrome looks in place of the usual colour options, with plenty of control over detailed settings. Pressing the Info button on the back gives quick access to even more features, via a neatly laid-out onscreen control panel. As a result, almost every shooting setting can be changed without having to use the menus. Nearly every button and dial can be customised , and it’s also possible to store five different setups for quick recall via the U positions on the mode dial. As a result, it should be possible for users to configure the camera to operate exactly as they’d like. So while the sheer array of controls can look daunting at first, with practice the camera becomes quick and intuitive to use. Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome: Using manual lenses One of the big attractions of Pentax DSLRs is the huge range of K-mount lenses available, dating back to 1975. This includes the best range of dedicated APS-C format lenses produced for any DSLR system. There’s also a vast range of older film-era lenses, although the smaller sensor imposes a 1.5x field of view crop. While you’ll get full functionality with modern AF designs, the camera still works nicely with manual-focus lenses. You need to enter the focal length for the IBIS system to work correctly, and the camera can be set to request this when it’s switched on. The AF system will indicate when the subject is in focus, but for the most reliable results you’ll need to use magnified live view on the rear screen. With the oldest fully-manual lenses , you need to shoot in M mode and enable use of the lens’s aperture ring in the menu. Uniquely, you can tell the camera the aperture you’ve set by spinning the rear dial, which will be recorded in the EXIF
        data. To check the metering, you need to activate the depth-of-field preview using the power switch. Alternatively, if you press the ‘green button’ on the back, the camera will select the correct shutter speed and/or ISO setting itself. I used a 1980s-vintage Tamron 90mm F2.5 Macro with good results. Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome: Viewfinder and screen One standout feature of the K-3 Mark III design is the viewfinder , which is probably the finest of any APS-C DSLR. Given its size, it’s still impressively bright and clear. An information panel beneath the focusing screen displays detailed exposure settings, including metering and drive modes. Thanks to a transparent LCD overlay, you also get a choice of gridlines and a dual-axis electronic level, while a series of small icons allow you to change the S.Fn dial function with the camera up to your eye. It’s as close as you could realistically expect to get to the levels of information provided by the electronic viewfinders of mirrorless cameras. This is still an optical viewfinder, though, with all the usual drawbacks. It gets dark when you engage depth of field preview, making the effect difficult to judge. The focusing ‘snap’ with manual lenses is pretty good, but for truly accurate results you’ll need to switch to live view. Obviously, it can’t show any indication of how your images will turn out in terms of exposure, and nor can it preview the camera’s black & white output. Indeed, I often found myself wishing that that camera had an electronic viewfinder instead. Help is at hand here, to a degree, by switching to live view using the 3.2in rear screen. It’s sharp and clear and previews your processing and exposure settings, which means you can get a good idea of whether your shots are likely to work in black & white. It also gives a much better representation of what’s going on when you engage depth of field preview. Unfortunately, the lack of a tilting screen is a real drawback here, as it makes for awkward handling when shooting hand-held, or when you want to work at low or high angles from a tripod. Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome: Autofocus As DSLRs go, the K-3 Mark III Monochrome’s autofocus system is pretty impressive. It employs 101 focus points covering about two-thirds of the frame width, but only a third of its height, with 25 being of the more accurate cross-type. Only 41 points are user-selectable, with the remainder being used to keep track of moving subjects. However, you don’t get anywhere the same kind of subject-tracking performance as the latest mirrorless cameras, which can identify and hold focus on subjects almost anywhere within the frame. In addition to being able to specify a single focus point manually, several area modes are available that vary in terms of how many points they use, and across how much of the frame they can be positioned. These are useful with erratically moving subjects that might be difficult to follow using a single focus point; indeed some of them are only available in AF-C. Switch to live view, though, and AF is rather slower with a tendency to hunt for focus, especially when light levels drop. The saving grace, though, is that contrast detection AF is inherently very accurate, and the focus point can be positioned across a larger area of the frame. It’s perfect for shooting static subjects on a tripod, but less so for dynamic situations. Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome: Performance Overall, the Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome is quick and responsive , and won’t get in the way of your shooting. By DSLR standards, it’s reasonably unobtrusive too, with both the mirror and shutter mechanisms being soft and well-damped. But it’s not as quiet as most mirrorless models. If you do need to shoot silently , then it’s possible to enable the electronic shutter option in live view. However, this comes with significant rolling shutter effects, so it’s best used with static or slowly moving subjects only. The camera will also disengage live view after a minute’s inactivity, with the mirror dropping back down again audibly. It’s also important to understand that the electronic shutter setting also applies to viewfinder shooting ; first the mirror flips up, then the picture is taken after a short but noticeable delay. This has the benefit of extending the fastest shutter speed to 1/16,000sec, but means you get both the noise of the mirror and shutter mechanisms, and the risk of rolling shutter distortion. So you need to remember to disable the setting whenever you don’t need it. While the spec sheet promises the ability to shoot at 12 frames per second , I was never able to coax this speed from the camera in my testing. Instead, I measured 10fps for normal viewfinder shooting, and 11fps in live view, with a respectable 37-frame raw+JPEG buffer. Mind you, this should still be quick enough for almost any purpose. Metering is generally reliable, but by no means fool-proof. The standard multi-segment mode can be a little prone
        to underexposure in dull, grey conditions, while sometimes blowing out highlights in high-contrast situations. So you need to get used to anticipating this and pre-emptively applying exposure compensation. This is especially important with the monochrome sensor, as there’s no way of retrieving clipped highlight detail – once it’s gone, it’s gone. In this regard, I was surprised to find that highlights clip a stop earlier at ISO 200 compared to ISO 400 and higher settings, in both JPEG and raw files (the camera doesn’t indicate this in any way). This means that counter-intuitively, there’s a strong case for using ISO 400 as your base setting in bright light. Alternatively, you could use the highlight spot metering mode in concert with the AE-L button to avoid blowing out crucial detail. However, as the reading is taken in the centre of the frame, this will usually require recomposing each shot. Thankfully, the flip side of the sensor’s intolerance of over-exposure is a truly phenomenal dynamic range in raw files. At low ISOs, you can delve practically as deep as you like into the shadows and bring up remarkable levels of detail. In ISO 200 shots exposed to retain bright highlights, I was able to push Adobe Camera Raw’s exposure slider up to +4 or even +5 stops without spoiling the image. Even when some noise does start to appear, the fact that it has a granular, pixel-level pattern means that it’s not at all objectionable. The monochrome sensor responds to colour filters in front of the lens in much the same way as black & white film, which allows you to manipulate the tonality of your image files. For example, an orange or red filter will darken blue skies relative to clouds, giving a more dramatic look – you can see this in the composite image below. The big advantage compared to shooting film, though, is that you don’t need to worry in the same way about the impact of the filter on your shutter speed – you can either increase the ISO to compensate or rely on stabilisation to give sharp images. On this note, I found that the in-body image stabilisation worked pretty well. Using the 16-50mm zoom towards its wide end, I was able to get some usable images hand-held at shutter speeds as slow as 0.5sec using the 16-50mm zoom at its wider settings (although not every single shot). The only catch is that IBIS is never as effective with telephoto lenses, where many users will feel they need it most, and the viewfinder image isn’t stabilised either, so you get no feel for how well it’s working. You also need to ensure stabilisation is disabled when shooting on a tripod, or you’ll risk getting blurred images. The camera will do this automatically if you either engage the self-timer or use the optional infrared remote control. One feature that does seem slightly redundant is the anti-aliasing filter simulator . This uses the IS system to slightly blur the image, which in principle helps reduce image sampling artefacts. On the standard camera, that’s great for suppressing distracting colour moiré on fabrics, for example. On the Monochrome, though, it’s much less useful. In principle it might occasionally still reduce potential false detail with very fine repeating patterns. But mostly, it slightly softens the entire image for no clear gain. Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome: ISO and Noise One area where the monochrome sensor positively shines lies with high-ISO noise , or rather, the lack of it. At low sensitivities, the 26MP sensor resolves fine detail exceptionally cleanly, with barely any visible noise, and this is maintained right through to ISO 3200. The finest texture starts to blur away at ISO 6400, however the sensor continues to give entirely usable images right up to ISO 102,400, which is some way beyond any colour APS-C camera.

    - type: conclusion
      value: There’s no doubting that the Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7 is a solid enough entry-level camera, yet there’s little about it that really stirs the senses. While it is an affordable entry point into the Canon EOS DSLR system, it provides only an incremental upgrade over the 1300D . In terms of the competition, the Nikon D3500 betters it in many departments. The main issue, however, isn’t so much competition from rival DSLR manufacturers or indeed from the mirrorless segment but rather from one of Canon’s other entry-level models. While the 2000D is a solid enough camera in its own right, the 200D/250D easily provides much better value for money if you can extend your budget, especially when the 250D offers 4K video. While the 200D might be a 2017 model, resolution and image quality between it and the 2000D are all but indistinguishable, on top of which you’re getting a much more refined and feature-rich camera. If your budget simply won’t stretch that far, and you’re determined to buy into the Canon DSLR system, then the Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7 remains a solid if unspectacular alternative.

      value: 'The Canon Rebel T7 / EOS 2000D is the middle child of a DSLR trio Canon released in 2018. It offers a slight step up from the Canon EOS 4000D, and for beginners or those on a budget it’s a good starting DSLR. But does it offer enough to be one of the best Canon DSLRs ? Find out in our full review. Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7 at a glance: An attempt to diversify the firm’s entry-level offering, the trio consisted of the ultra-cheap, stripped-down Canon EOS 4000D or Rebel T100 , which had a rather lowball 18MP of resolution. On the other end was the 4K-capable Canon EOS 250D or Rebel SL3 , an upper-entry-level DSLR that still has a solid rep today. And sitting in the middle was the Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7. Well, sort of in the middle. Truthfully, the EOS 2000D is closer in spirit to the Canon EOS 4000D . It’s basically the same proposition in terms of its 9-point AF system, its 100-600 native ISO range and its Full HD 30p video limit. The real internal difference is in the resolution; as opposed to the meagre 18MP on the EOS 4000D, the EOS 2000D sports a rather more generous 24.1MP, giving users a lot more latitude for printing and cropping into images. The trade-off, of course, is that it’s more expensive. While the used market has flattened it out a bit, you’ll still pay up to $100 / £100 more for an EOS 2000D / Rebel T7. By the same taken, you’d also pay more for a Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 , which goes for around $649 / £549 body only. Everyone loves a middle options, but is the EOS 2000D worth its asking price? Is it one of the best value DSLRs you can buy, or is that cut price too good to be true? We’re digging into the capabilities of this small DSLR to find out in our Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7 review… Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7 – Alternatives and Rivals We’ve already mentioned the alternatives to the Canon EOS 2000D in the Canon stable – and we’ll get further into these comparisons later in this review. But how does the EOS 2000D measure up on the wider market? An obvious comparison is in the Nikon DSLR line, Canon’s main direct rival, and this entire Canon trio can be directly compared to the 24MP Nikon D3500 , which currently runs up to around £399 / $499 with a lens on the second-hand market, with some wiggle room. It’s an excellent DSLR that makes for a pleasant learning experience , and has the EOS 2000D beat on a number of factors, including an 11-point AF system rather than the EOS 2000D’s 9-point one. Look into the world of mirrorless and you can find a number of well-priced cameras that make for tempting beginner options. The Sony A6000 is an apt example, generally costing around $500 / £300 on the used market and delivering a few markedly better features than the cheaper EOS 2000D, including an 11fps burst rate. Something like the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G7 could also fit the bill; it can currently be picked up new with a 14-42mm lens for $397 / £449, though it’s a lot more video-focused than the EOS 2000D. Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7 – Features In terms of its key hardware components and headline specifications, the 2000D is almost identical to the Canon EOS 1300D from 2016 that it succeeds. The main difference between the two is that the 2000D comes with a 24.1MP APS-C CMOS sensor compared to the 1300D’s 18MP chip. Elsewhere, there is little to separate the 2000D and 1300D. For example, the 2000D comes with the same DIGIC 4+ image processor found inside the 1300D, the upshot of which is that it doesn’t offer any significant upgrades in terms of performance. Sensitivity also remains unchanged, with the 2000D providing a native range of ISO 100-6400 plus an extended setting equivalent to ISO 12,800 . By way of comparison, the older Canon 200D can be extended to the equivalent of ISO 51,200, while the aforementioned Nikon D3500 offers a maximum setting of ISO 25,600. Video recording abilities also remain at 1080p Full HD capture at 30fps, backed up by 720p HD capture at 60fps and VGA capture at 30fps. This puts the 2000D slightly behind both the Nikon D3500 and Canon 200D, both of which can record Full HD video at up to 60fps. Focal Points On the back, the 2000D has a 3in 920k-dot LCD display that is vastly superior to the 2.7in/230k-dot display of the 4000D. Unlike the 200D and 250D, however, it is fixed in place and lacks any touch functionality. Above this sits a pentamirror viewfinder that provides 95% coverage. While it’s bright and clear , it is small compared to those found on higher-end DSLRs, at 0.5x equivalent magnification. In addition to the standard quartet of PASM exposure modes, the 2000D provides a fully automatic Scene Intelligent Auto mode for point-and-shoot duties, alongside a Creative Auto mode for simplified depth-of-field control. The exposure-mode dial is rounded off by a Forced Flash Off mode and six individual Scene positions: Portrait, Landscape, Close-up, Sports, Food and Night Portrait. In terms of JPEG image-processing options, the 2000D offers Canon’s
        shadow-boosting Auto Lighting Optimizer , plus the usual array of Picture Styles that can be used to adjust contrast, saturation and sharpness. Canon EOS 2000D / Rebel T7 – Body and design In terms of its size, weight and general appearance, the 2000D is all but identical to the 1300D. Encased within a polycarbonate shell, it’s relatively well protected from the kind of occasional bumps most cameras sustain over time, on top of which it also benefits from a metal lens mount. As we’d expect of an entry-level DSLR at this price point, the 2000D isn’t weather-proofed, so you’ll need to take care when using it in wet weather. Aesthetically, the 2000D stays true to Canon’s principle of functional design, with its curved edges and matt-black finish giving it a relatively clean and modern look. As with its predecessor, it is guilty of feeling a bit plasticky, though. Thanks to its textured grip and sculpted thumb rest, the 2000D sits nicely in the hand , and feels well balanced with the 18-55mm IS II kit lens attached. Compared to the 4000D, the 2000D boasts a relatively generous array of buttons, all of which are well spaced, relatively large and clearly labelled. The four buttons that comprise the d-pad provide direct access to ISO, Autofocus, White Balance and Drive Mode settings. To the left of these is a useful Quick Menu button (marked ‘Q’), which can be used to call up an intuitive menu that’s tailored to the camera’s current exposure mode. While it lacks any user-assignable function buttons, you do get an AE-Lock button , which is a nice touch for an entry-level camera. Canon has chosen to remove the graphical user interface found on the 200D altogether, which seems an odd decision given the 2000D’s entry-level positioning. It does, however, come with a feature guide that offers simplified explanations of what the camera’s various modes and features do as you switch between them. Canon EOS 2000D / – Rebel T7 Performance Given that the 2000D increases resolution to 24MP but employs the same DIGIC 4+ processor as the 1300D, it’s no great surprise to discover that the camera isn’t particularly speedy. Continuous shooting, for example, maxes out at 3fps which is slower than the Canon 200D, 250D and Nikon D3500 , both of which can shoot at 5fps. At 3fps we were able to capture around 40 consecutive full-size JPEGs before the buffer filled and the speed dropped, while in raw this fell to around 10 consecutive images. In raw + JPEG, we were only able to capture around six or seven consecutive frames before the camera began to stutter. Autofocus through the viewfinder is taken care of via the same 9-point phase-detect module used by the 1300D (and also the 4000D/200D). While perfectly functional, this now feels rather dated. Despite relatively limited coverage, focus acquisition is both fast and accurate , especially when shooting static subjects. In live-view mode, it’s a different story altogether, with the 2000D’s contrast-detect system being painfully slow to acquire focus even in good light. In this respect, Canon’s decision not to bestow the 2000D with the Dual Pixel on-sensor phase-detection technology offered by the 200D and 250D strikes us as a missed opportunity. With the supplied 18-55mm IS II kit lens attached, focusing is also rather noisy, which is something to bear in mind when shooting video, especially given the 2000D’s lack of an external microphone input. As we’d expect, the 2000D’s APS-C sensor delivers very good image quality, producing clean and attractive JPEGs , especially at lower sensitivities. The additional resolution that the 2000D enjoys over the 1300D and 4000D is also useful for those looking to make larger prints or crop more aggressively into images without sacrificing overall image quality. Metering from the 63-zone metering module is generally reliable, while automatic white balance metering is consistently on point , producing accurate and lifelike colour. Resolution At ISO 100 and shooting in raw, the 2000D’s 24.2MP APS-C sensor is able to resolve 3,200l/ph. Raising the sensitivity to ISO 800 produces a figure of 2,800l/ph. At higher ISO settings, sharpness falls off more rapidly, with ISO 6400 producing a figure of 2,400l/ph and ISO 12,800 resolving 2,200l/ph. ISO and Noise performance In-camera JPEG processing gives excellent results between ISO 100 and ISO 200, with no traces of noise even when viewing images at 100%. By ISO 400 and 800, some minor artefacts are visible in shadow areas at 100%. By ISO 1600, softening is slightly more pronounced, but images remain good overall. At IS0 3200 the softening effects of noise become more noticeable, increasing further by ISO 6400.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The 250D is equipped with a range of novice-friendly features including its built-in Guided Mode, and beyond this there’s plenty for more advanced photography. Our only real gripe is the camera’s 9-point AF system, which while perfectly functional does feel a bit dated. Thankfully this is somewhat offset by the 250D’s excellent AF performance when used in live-view mode. With the older 200D no longer available new, the 250D now becomes the de facto choice for a compact Canon DSLR, especially if you value 4K movie recording, and the 250D’s enhanced live view AF and improved battery performance. Therefore, if you have the budget, we’d recommend choosing the 250D over the 200D.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Canon Rebel SL3 / EOS 250D was quite possibly Canon’s last DSLR for beginners. It features a compact but stylish design , with a 24MP sensor, and 4K video recording, meaning it still competes with newer cameras . But does it offer enough to be one of the best Canon DSLRs ? Find out in our full review. Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 at a glance: As Canon is investing more and more time and energy into its EOS R mirrorless system, and introducing relatively inexpensive beginner cameras such as the Canon EOS R50 , it’s looking as if DSLRs are going to become a thing of the past as far as the manufacturer is concerned. If that’s the case, then the EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 was a hell of a note to go out on. Look around any photography beginner’s college course and you’ll likely spot a few EOS 250D cameras, or at least ones that look very similar. It’s one of the most popular and best cameras for photography students due to its helpful guide modes, its access to the enormous Canon EF lens range , and its ability to make fantastic-looking images without costing the earth . Back in 2018, the EOS 250D was actually released as part of a trio, along with the EOS 2000D and the EOS 4000D , giving novice users a choice of DSLRs with which to start their photography journey. The EOS 250D was the most advanced of the three, and frankly has held up the best. The 2000D and 4000D were a little too simplified for their own good, and given that you could buy a similarly specced older DSLR such as the EOS 1300D second hand for the same price, they did little to justify even their meagre price tags. With 4K video, a well-sized APS-C sensor and tactile DSLR handling, the EOS 250D holds up on paper as a respectable beginner-to-intermediate camera . But has time moved on too far in 2023 for it to merit consideration for serious photographers? Let’s take a deeper look in our Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 review. Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 – Rivals and alternatives Currently, in the US, you can get the Canon Rebel SL3 with an 18-55mm lens for around $749, or in the UK pick up the Canon EOS 250D with an 18-55mm – same camera, same lens – for about £649. While this isn’t hugely expensive for a camera, it isn’t hugely cheap either, so it’s worth looking at what else you might get for a similar outlay. First off, do you definitely want a DSLR? DSLRs and mirrorless cameras have plenty of advantages and disadvantages of their own, and you can see our DSLR vs mirrorless guide for a full breakdown. If you’re set on a DSLR, then the obvious alternative manufacturer to look at is Nikon. Nikon’s cheapest and most beginner-friendly DSLR is the Nikon D3500 , which is being discontinued, but is plentifully available used at around $532 or £349. However, given that the EOS 250D sits a little above ultra-entry level, a sensible comparison might also be Nikon’s mid-range D5600 , which is very similar to the D3500, but sports a much more advanced autofocus system and a fold-out, swivelling LCD screen. It’s worth noting, though, that neither camera shoots 4K video, whereas the EOS 250D does. If you’re considering mirrorless, there are plenty of options at a similar price point. We’ve already mentioned Canon’s own EOS R50, which is the current cheapest on-boarding route into the EOS R mirrorless system. It has an APS-C sensor just like the EOS 250D, but benefits from up-to-date computational features such as subject-detect autofocus. It does cost more, though, currently sitting at $799 / £899 with a lens. From other manufacturers, meanwhile, you may want to consider an APS-C mirrorless camera from Sony. The Sony A6100 goes for around $848 / £749 with a lens included, and offers UHD 4K without such a vicious crop and with slightly higher frame rates than the EOS 250D. You could also try the rugged, enthusiast-focused Panasonic Lumix G90 , a Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera that nevertheless handles like a DSLR. It’s good to keep these alternatives in mind as we run through the complete feature-set and strengths/weaknesses of the Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3. Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 – Features The 250D is built around a 24.1MP APS-C CMOS sensor and Canon’s DIGIC 8 image processor – the same combination used inside Canon’s M50 mirrorless camera from 2018. By way of comparison, the 200D uses a 24.2MP sensor and the slightly older DIGIC 7 processor. The main benefit of the 250D’s newer processor is the ability to record 4K video footage at 25fps , while the 200D’s video capabilities only extend as far as 1080p Full HD capture at 60fps. Aside from the introduction of 4K video and some minor cosmetic and operational changes, there isn’t a lot else that separates the 200D from the 250D / Rebel SL3. The only other major difference is in the number of available focus points when using live view mode – more on that a little later. Sensitivity remains unchanged from the 200D with a native range of ISO 100-25,600 plus an expanded setting that’s equivalent to
        ISO 51,200. Shutter speed ranges from 30sec-1/4000sec plus a bulb setting for self-timed long exposures. In terms of exposure modes, the 250D comes with the standard PASM quartet for more-advanced users, along with a Scene Intelligent Auto mode for basic point-and-shoot duties. The 250D / Rebel SL3 also offers 14 individual scene-specific modes along with a range of 10 digital filter effects that can be applied either at the point of capture, or to JPEGs afterwards via the image-editing tools found in the Playback menu. The 250D is well served by a wide range of on-board JPEG processing options including eight Picture Style presets – Auto, Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Fine Detail, Neutral, Faithful, Monochrome – plus three custom settings. For those who want to get their images looking exactly as they want directly from the camera, sliders can be used to further refine the Sharpness, Saturation and Colour Tone settings for each individual Picture Style preset. The 250D also comes equipped with Canon’s Auto Lighting Optimizer, which is designed to boost shadow detail in darker areas of an image. There are three settings – Low, Standard and High – to choose from, along with the option to turn it off altogether. Canon’s Highlight Tone Priority tool, which is designed to preserve highlight detail, comes with two strength settings: Enable (D+) and Enhanced (D+2), although it too can be switched off should you wish. In addition, the 250D also provides Long Exposure NR for exposures of over one second, plus High ISO noise reduction in three strength settings: Low, Standard and High. Last but not least is a built-in Lens Aberration Correction tool that’s designed to correct vignetting and distortion, and a Digital Lens Optimizer tool that helps to increase image sharpness. 6 key features you need to know Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 – Body and design In terms of its size and weight, the EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 is all but identical to its predecessor, albeit a couple of grams lighter. Given that the 200D was already the smallest DSLR on the market at the time of its launch, Canon would have been hard-pressed to make the 250D any smaller. Take away the 250D’s optical viewfinder and pop-up flash housing, and you’re left with something that’s comparable in size and weight to many mirrorless cameras. For those looking for an entry-level DSLR and for whom portability is a priority, the 250D certainly ticks all the right boxes. Build quality is very much on a par with other DSLRs at this price point, and while the polycarbonate outer shell isn’t as robust as the magnesium-alloy construction found on more expensive Canon DSLRs, it does feel solid enough to withstand the occasional knock that can occur in everyday use. Note that the 250D also lacks any form of weather-sealing, meaning you’ll need to take care when using it in wet weather or around water. As with most entry-level DSLRs, physical buttons and controls have been kept to a minimum, with a single control dial located just behind the shutter button on the top-plate. Button placement is all but identical to the 200D, although the Forced Flash Off and Creative Auto positions have been removed from the exposure-mode dial altogether. It’s still possible to use Creative Auto on the 250D, but it now resides within the Scene Intelligent Auto mode, with a panel on the right-hand side of the touchscreen providing access to its various guided features. Should you want to force the flash on or off you can still do so, but you’ll need to enter the in-camera menu. As with the 200D, the 250D is equipped with a 3in, 1.04-million-dot touchscreen display on the back. It’s a high-quality screen that renders captured images in good detail, with an option to zoom in and check image sharpness via a simple pinch-to-zoom gesture. Touchscreen control also makes the camera more intuitive to operate, especially with the aid of the physical ‘Q’ button on the back of the camera, which brings up a neatly arranged graphical menu providing direct access to the camera’s key settings from a single screen. As with the 200D, the 250D’s display can be set to either Guided or Standard mode. The former aims to help newcomers to DSLR photography by providing a more intuitive graphical interface that includes descriptions of the various tools, modes and functions and how these can be used to affect the look of captured images. Canon EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 – Performance The 250D provides nine individual AF points arranged in a diamond shape across the central portion of the viewfinder. The central AF point is of the cross-type variety, the rest being linear. Frame coverage isn’t the most comprehensive, and the 250D’s viewfinder AF system does feel a bit dated, especially when compared to the Nikon D5600’s more advanced 39-point AF system. While this won’t be too much of an issue when faced with static subjects, the large gaps between individual AF points mean that the 250D can struggle with moving ones,
        especially if some distance away or moving erratically. This isn’t the case when the camera is used in live view mode. As with the 200D, the 250D inherits Canon’s excellent Dual Pixel AF technology, which uses phase-detection pixels on the sensor to improve AF performance in live-view mode. The result is that focus acquisition in live view is speedy and precise . Better still, Canon has upped the number of these phase-detection pixels from 40 to 3,975 points, which improves accuracy greatly. When faced with moving subjects we found the 250D to perform much more consistently and accurately when set to Tracking AF in live view. If anything, the 250D’s stellar AF performance in live view only exacerbates how dated the 9-point viewfinder AF system feels. The 250D’s maximum continuous shooting speed is a useful 5fps – exactly the same as the Nikon D5600 . The camera also provides a Silent shutter option, and while this is slightly quieter than the regular shutter it’s far from silent. In testing, there was no upper limit to the number of Fine JPEGs we were able to capture at the maximum 5fps; we were able to shoot for well over 10 seconds with no slowdown. Switching to raw capture, we managed approximately 12 consecutive images before the frame rate dropped, while in JPEG+raw capture this dropped to around eight consecutive images before the buffer filled and the frame rate slowed. Battery performance has also been much improved over the 200D, with the 250D capable of around 1,000 images per charge , compared to around 650 images on the 200D. Resolution Set to ISO 100 in raw, the 250D is able to resolve 3,700l/ph. This drops as the sensitivity is raised, but at ISO 1600 it still achieves 3,000l/ph. Thereafter, resolution drops fall off more rapidly, with ISO 6400 registering 2,600l/ph. The highest native ISO 25,600 setting gives 2,400l/ph, while ISO 51,200 gave just 1,900l/ph. Noise Canon’s JPEG processing provides excellent results at low ISO, with no visible noise. Images captured at ISO 1600 remain pretty good when viewed at regular sizes, but the softening effects of noise reduction become much more pronounced by ISO 6400. ISO 12,800 can be considered the tipping point above which image quality quickly deteriorates, with the higher ISO settings being ‘emergency use only’.'

      value: 'If you’re looking for a APS-C Digital SLR with high build-quality, then the Nikon D7500 is about as good as it gets, making it one of the best Nikon DSLRs . Find out how this 20MP camera performs in our review: What is the Nikon D7500? The Nikon D7500 is a DSLR designed for enthusiast photographers. With a 20.9MP DX-format sensor and 8fps shooting, it was introduced between the Nikon D5600 and the D500 in Nikon’s range. It started out at around $1,250 / £1,300 for the body only when it was launched in 2017, but now costs $999 / £1,049. This is a welcome price drop in a climate that has seen most prices increasing, but reflects the fact that the D7500 uses relatively old technology and has been around a while. Judged on its own merits it’s still a fine camera, however, even today. At first it suffered in comparison with the 24MP Nikon D7200 , which was cheaper and in some ways more appealing, but now the D7200 is no longer on sale, that leaves the Nikon D7500 as one of the few DSLRs still being sold new . Contemporary rivals include the Canon EOS 90D , which is more expensive but also more advanced, and various Pentax DSLRs including the new Pentax KF . For those with a bigger budget, the mighty Nikon D850 is still on sale, too, so while DSLRs might be in decline, there’s still a good deal of choice. Take a look at our guide to the best Nikon DSLRs for more models, and also the best Nikon F-mount lenses to go with them. Nikon D7500 – Features With Nikon’s Expeed 5 processor, the D7500 offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-51,200 , which is expandable up to ISO 1,640,000. As we’ll see, these hugely extended ISOs don’t give great results, but that shouldn’t mask the fact that this sensor delivers excellent high-ISO image quality. Nikon says the D7500 can shoot at 8fps for 50 raw frames in a burst, which is a significant advance over the D7200’s 27 frames at 6fps. In practice, with a 16GB SanDisk Extreme U3 card rated at 90MB/sec, I measured an even faster rate of 8.2fps, but a slightly smaller buffer of 46 frames using lossless compression. This should still be ample for all but the most trigger-happy of action shooters. Being a DSLR, the D7500 can track focus at full speed using its 51-point autofocus system , which uses the same phase-detection module as the D7200. Users can also match their specific lenses to their camera, with the Auto AF Fine Tune function to give the best focusing accuracy. In live view, however, it falls back on contrast AF focusing technology – the Nikon D780 is the only Nikon DSLR to feature a sensor with on-chip phase-detection. Metering employs a 180K-pixel RGB sensor – which is also used for face detection and subject recognition – while feeding information into the AF system to help the camera understand how a subject is moving around the frame. Alongside the usual matrix, centre-weighted and spot modes, the D7500 gains Nikon’s highlight-weighted metering . This aims to avoid clipping bright areas of the image to white, allowing the user to make the most of the sensor’s dynamic range when post-processing raw files. Perhaps surprisingly, the D7500 has just a single SD card slot, unlike either the D7200 or the D500. Another limitation is that older manual-focus lenses can only be used in manual-exposure mode, without any metering. While these omissions will disappoint Nikon fans, fundamentally, they reflect the fact that the D7000-series is no longer top of the firm’s DX lineup. Better news is that the built-in pop-up flash can work with Nikon’s radio-controlled Advanced Wireless Lighting system to operate off-camera speedlights wirelessly for creative lighting control. Nikon says the EN-EL15a battery should provide 950 shots per charge, and while this is down from 1,110 compared to the D7200, it will still be ample for most purposes. In-camera raw processing allows you to tweak images before sharing them, and to this end, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow connection to a smartphone driven by Nikon’s SnapBridge app. I’ll look at this in more detail later. For video, both 4K and Full HD recording are available. However, while the latter uses the full width of the sensor, 4K reads from a 3840×2160 pixel region in the centre; this imposes a 1.5x field-of-view crop. In-camera electronic image stabilisation is available to compensate for shake when shooting hand-held. This has the advantage of being able to correct for rotation around the lens axis , which is important for video but something in-lens stabilisation simply can’t do. It also works with every lens, not just optically stabilised ones. But, sadly, it only functions in Full HD mode, not 4K. Nikon D7500 – Build and handling For this price you’d expect Nikon to deliver a solid-feeling, ergonomically sound camera, and with the D7500 that’s exactly what you get. It has a deep grip with a thick rubberised coating that feels extremely secure in your hand , and a weather-sealed body that’s compact without being cramped.
        The body measures 135.5x104x72.5mm and weighs 720g – a little heavier than the D7200, but noticeably smaller than the D500. The control setup is based on the D7200’s, but in a welcome change, the ISO button is now much more sensibly placed; it sits immediately behind the shutter release, as on the D500. This comes at the expense of the D7200’s metering mode button, which has relocated to the camera’s back – a much more sensible prioritisation of these two functions. Almost every important shooting function can be changed using easy-to-access external controls . There’s an exposure-mode dial on the left shoulder and a drive-mode dial beneath, both of which lock in position to prevent accidental changes. Front and rear electronic dials change the main exposure settings, while the D-pad on the back is used to move the focus area. Key settings such as metering, white balance, autofocus and flash mode have dedicated buttons on the camera body, while two Fn buttons on the front can be customised to suit the user. A press of the ‘i’ button on the camera’s back brings up a short menu of other settings, mostly to do with image processing. Personally, I’d have liked to see a user-customisable quick menu here, as with most other cameras at this price point. But, to be honest, the D7500 is so well set up overall that this is a minor complaint. This review originally featured on Trusted Reviews . Nikon D7500 – Viewfinder and screen The D7500 has a reasonably large and bright optical viewfinder , with 0.94x magnification and 100% coverage of the lens’s field of view. A sensor above the eyepiece automatically switches off the rear screen when you’re using the viewfinder. As well as displaying the most important exposure data in a panel beneath the focusing screen, it’s also possible to overlay gridlines to aid composition or show a dual-axis electronic level – although, oddly, you can’t have both at the same time. Naturally, you don’t get any of the advantages of electronic viewing when it comes to accurately previewing exposure, white balance or depth of field before shooting – which is a considerable disadvantage of DSLRs compared to mirrorless cameras. Below the viewfinder is the 3.2in 922k-dot LCD, which is an impressively slim unit that tilts up and down while adding little to the depth of the camera. To be honest, I’d have preferred a fully articulated design as seen on the D5600 or Canon EOS 90D , since tilt-only screens are useless when shooting in portrait format. In Live View the screen gives an accurate depiction of how your shots will come out, with exposure, white balance and depth of field all previewed live. This represents a considerable advantage over older Nikon D7000-series DSLRs , which couldn’t adjust the aperture diaphragm while the cameras was in Live View. Alongside touch focus and touch shutter release in Live View and video modes, the touchscreen can be used to operate menu selections and browse through images in playback, just like on a smartphone. But overall touch operation still feels tacked on as an afterthought, and the D7500 lacks features common elsewhere – such as touch focus point selection when using the viewfinder, or a customisable touch-sensitive control panel you can configure with your most-used functions. Nikon D7500 – Autofocus When it comes to autofocus, it’s very much a tale of two systems. For viewfinder shooting, the D7500 uses a 51-point phase-detection system , with the AF array providing decent coverage by SLR standards – about 75% of the frame width, and 50% of its height. Autofocus is super-fast and decisive, even in low light; indeed, Nikon says it’s sensitive down to -3EV, or effectively moonlight . The D7500 also gains the group-area AF mode previously seen on the D500, which allows multiple AF points to be used for keeping track of a moving subject, and works very effectively. Switch to Live View, however, and it’s a very different story. Nikon is still using a rather basic contrast-detection system, and it’s painfully slow compared to mirrorless cameras or Canon’s Dual Pixel AF system. It’s okay for static subjects, but don’t even think about using it for anything that moves – indeed, Nikon doesn’t even bother offering an AF-C mode. On a more positive note, though, the AF point can be placed anywhere in the scene, and since focusing uses the image sensor itself, it’s consistently accurate – even with fast primes and off-centre subjects. Seasoned DSLR users will be used to this kind of behaviour, and may well be happy using the two AF systems in a complementary fashion. But the fact remains that the D7500’s modern mirrorless rivals all focus much quicker when you’re shooting with the rear screen and indeed offer the same AF system and choices in both viewfinder and live view shooting. Nikon D7500 – Video With the same sensor and processor as the D500, the D7500 can record 4K video, giving impressively detailed footage. However, since it’s captured from a 3840×2160-pixel
        area at the centre of the sensor, it imposes a 1.5x field-of-view crop. It does not offer the full-width ‘oversampling’ of modern mirrorless alternatives. This can be an advantage if you’re trying to record distant action – sports or wildlife, perhaps – but it’s more problematic if you want to shoot a wideangle view. It’s also possible to record Full HD video with no crop, although the quality of the footage isn’t anywhere near as good, and you’d get better results downsampling 4K. That said, it isn’t obviously much worse than other DSLRs, and is fine if you just want to record the occasional video. One key new feature is the addition of built-in electronic image stabilisation for Full HD video, which appears to be a similar system to the one Canon introduced in its EOS cameras. It does a pretty good job of reducing the visibility of camera shake while shooting video hand-held, even when you’re using an unstabilised lens. However, it isn’t as effective as the in-body systems found in some competing cameras. Nikon has included a flat Picture Control mode designed to allow easy colour grading of your footage in post-production , and a zebra pattern display to help you avoid clipping highlight detail. You can use the touchscreen to autofocus on a new subject during recording, but this is slow and shows a distinct contrast-detection ‘wobble’ effect in your footage, which means it isn’t very usable in practice. Sadly, there’s no peaking display to help with manual focusing either. These deficiencies leave the D7500 rather lacking in comparison to cameras such as the Canon EOS 90D or Sony Alpha 6500, so if you’re specifically looking for a camera that’s good for video, this isn’t the best choice. Nikon D7500 – SnapBridge Connectivity As with Nikon’s other recent cameras, the D7500 includes Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity . This is designed to establish an always-on connection to a tablet or smartphone via the free SnapBridge app for Android and iOS, and automatically transfer across a 2MP copy of every single image you take for sharing. Alternatively, you can choose to send across only your favourite images by marking them in playback using the camera’s ‘i’ button. SnapBridge also provides a basic remote control capability with a Live View feed, but with no ability to change any settings remotely, it feels terribly outdated. It’s possible to pair the camera with multiple devices, so you can alternate between using a smartphone and tablet. However, since there’s no option to set up a Wi-Fi-only connection, you have to manually switch between them each time using the camera’s Bluetooth menu – which isn’t very intuitive or convenient. I found that the best option is to add the Paired Devices sub-setting to the camera’s custom My Menu. If you’re happy to work how Nikon thinks you should, SnapBridge functions pretty well, transferring your shots to your smart device with minimum fuss. It’s clever enough to pause transmission when the camera battery becomes low to conserve power for shooting, then resume transferring images after recharging. However, if you prefer to work the other way round, taking advantage of the larger, higher-resolution screen of your phone or tablet to browse through your images then pull your favourites across individually, the process is annoyingly slow and clunky, with thumbnails taking an age to generate every single time. Nikon D7500 – Performance In general use, the D7500 is an impressively accomplished performer , more than capable of handling almost any photographic situation you might present it with. Having shot well over a thousand images with the camera across a wide variety of situations, I rarely found it wanting . Image quality is very good indeed, with the 20.9MP sensor delivering detailed images at low ISO settings and keeping noise under control up to about ISO 6400; it produced usable files even at settings as high as ISO 51,200. Nikon’s matrix metering does a decent job generally. If anything, it errs on the side of underexposure to protect highlights, which is far more desirable than irrevocably clipping bright highlights. JPEG colour rendition is by default bright and punch y, even at high ISO settings where colours might start to fade on other cameras. If you want to pep things up further, then Vivid and Landscape Picture Controls are available, while the Neutral and Portrait settings give more subtle renditions. Nikon also offers a huge amount of control over the image-processing settings, so it should be possible to tweak colour output to match your taste. However, I did find the auto white balance to be a little erratic, with a clear habit of erring too much towards the cool side on bright, sunny blue-sky days, which makes images look a bit sterile. In such cases it’s easy enough to switch to a preset, of course. If you’re shooting raw then you can also re-process in-camera with a better white balance setting. Alternatively, most mobile imaging apps will let you quickly
        warm up the image, too. In most cases, only a slight tweak is needed to give a more attractive result. Nikon D7500 – Image Quality Nikon has used the same 20.9MP DX-format sensor as in last year’s D500, and it delivers similarly impressive image quality in the D7500. It’s slightly lower resolution than the 24MP sensors in Nikon’s cheaper DX DSLRs, but this has little practical impact unless you print larger than A3 (16x11in). The resolution of mid-range cameras seems to have hit a plateau since the D7500’s launch, so it’s not been left far behind at all. In return, its high-ISO performance is very good indeed, despite the fact that the extended settings beyond ISO 51,200 are hugely over-optimistic. As usual, you’ll get the best possible results in terms of fine detail and noise control by carefully processing raw files. Nikon D7500 – Resolution In JPEG, the D7500 delivers 3200 lines per picture height (l/ph) in our resolution chart tests. Using carefully processed raw files you’ll achieve rather better results, of around 3600 l/ph. Noise progressively reduces resolution as the sensitivity setting is increased, and by the time we reach ISO 1600, it’s down to around 3200 l/ph in raw. Move up the scale to ISO 12,800 and the D7500 still registers 3,200 l/ph, but beyond this things deteriorate rapidly. The extended ISOs show very low resolution due to extremely high noise, with any detail on our resolution chart barely discernible by ISO 819,200. Multiply the numbers on the crops below by 200 for the resolution in l/ph Nikon D7500 – Dynamic Range Nikon D7500 –  ISO and Noise At low ISOs the D7500’s image quality is superb; fine detail is rendered with impressive sharpness and there’s no visible noise . At ISO 800, noise starts to have an impact on image quality, with low-contrast textures starting to blur and shadows losing detail. ISO 1600 is still eminently usable, but by the time we hit ISO 6400 fine detail and colour saturation are visibly suffering. Image quality progressively degrades at higher ISOs, and by ISO 51,200 colour rendition has become very broad-brush – although the image is still recognisable. The first extended sensitivity of ISO 102,400 is still just about okay, but at higher settings it’s increasingly difficult to see the point as the image disappears under an ocean of noise, acquiring a distinct magenta hue at the top two extended ISOs. Should I buy the Nikon D7500? With the D7500, Nikon made an extremely capable DSLR that will, I’m sure, satisfy the needs of a lot of serious enthusiast photographers even in today’s mirrorless-dominated market. There are still photographers who prefer the size and handling of DSLRs and the look of their optical viewfinders. The original conundrum for prospective buyers was whether it was good enough to command a significant premium over its predecessor, the highly-regarded D7200. As Nikon’s former DX flagship, this includes features that have been left out of the D7500 – most notably, dual-card slots and a magnesium-alloy body shell, alongside a slightly higher 24MP resolution. This is compounded by the fact that many of the D7500’s updates turn out to offer relatively minor benefits over its predecessor in practice. For example, it’s great to have a tilting screen, but the camera’s relatively slow Live View autofocus meant I rarely used it. However, the D7200 has since been discontinued and is now available only on the used market, so the D7500 has the field to itself.'

      value: Nikon's most recent DSLR launch was back in 2020 and the D780 has proved a popular buy despite all the clamour surrounding mirrorless cameras. If your preference is for an DSLR, the D780 offers a compelling option, as reviewer Michael Topham found when he tested it
    - type: conclusion
      value: 'Nikon’s D700-series has been a staple part of the full-frame DSLR market for more than a decade and close rival to Canon’s EOS 5D series since 2008. The D780 arrives a bit late for those who’ve already jumped ship to Nikon’s excellent Z-series, or other full-frame mirrorless system, but this doesn’t take anything away from what is a sensational camera that’s built to a professional standard and is a sheer delight to use. It’ll provide top-level service to photographers who aren’t fully enamoured by the thought of switching to mirrorless, especially those who want to continue using their F-mount lenses without an adapter and still swear by having an optical viewfinder. Merging two AF systems into one camera to improve the Live View performance has been superbly executed. Saying that, it does take time to familiarise yourself with the pros and cons of both. Sports and action photographers still get reliable AF tracking via the viewfinder, supported by wider AF coverage in Live View and super responsive eye-detection AF. Introducing 4K video, advanced movie functionality, a dedicated focus stacking mode, touchscreen control, in-camera charging, a larger buffer, better connectivity and refined button layout has turned Nikon’s versatile all-rounder into an even better one. The absence of a pop up flash, joystick and optional battery grip will frustrate a few, but all things considered there’s so much more to like than there is to find fault with. People who demand dual card slot, long battery life and optical finder will find they are well served by the D780 but the mirrorless opportunity is there. For example, the Z6 II costs $1,700 / £1,739 (body only) and has the advantage of being smaller, lighter and offers in-body image stabilisation, which does make the D780 feel a bit on the pricey side. It’s great to see Nikon continuing to cater for photographers who swear by using DSLRs, especially in a world where all the talk today is about mirrorless systems, which look set to be the future. Nikon’s outlook is all about giving customers’ choice over which route they’d rather take. For those who aren’t ready to convert to mirrorless, the D780 keeps the flag flying high for DSLRs and a mighty fine example it is too. Nikon D780: Hands on first look Nikon D780: At a glance When Nikon announced the Z 50 at the end of 2019, the manufacturer was keen to stress that their strategy going forward would be to run their DSLR and mirrorless systems in tandem. The reasoning for this is that Nikon firmly believes photographers see advantages of both systems, with DSLRs continuing to be the first choice of those who prefer an optical viewfinder and having longer battery life and mirrorless cameras becoming extremely popular with those who are more conscious of size, weight and portability. Nikon has backed up what they said by releasing a new DSLR for a new decade that’s designed to have all-round appeal with enthusiasts and professionals. The new camera we’re talking about is the Nikon D780. You could easily be mistaken for thinking this new release could mark the end for the much-loved D750 , but Nikon has confirmed the D750 will remain in the lineup and it is still available new in some countries (but not in the UK), with the D780 slotting in-between the D750 and Z 6II in the company’s product lineup. Perhaps most interesting of all is the way Nikon has taken some of its learning’s from mirrorless and applied it into the D780, which is said to be Nikon’s most versatile DSLR ever. Nikon D780: Features Although the pixel count is similar to the D750 , the D780 introduces a new full frame CMOS sensor with a resolution of 24.5-million-pixels. Like the chip used in the Nikon Z 6 , the D780’s sensor features a low-pass filter and benefits from a backside-illuminated structure to maximize its light gathering capabilities. By effectively implementing the same sensor and on chip phase detection that the Z 6 uses, users get the same 51-point autofocus system with 15 cross-type points as the D750 when focusing via the optical viewfinder and 273-point phase-detection autofocus when it’s used in Live View. This is the first time we’ve seen a Nikon DSLR borrow an AF system for Live View from one of their mirrorless models and suggests the same approach could be repeated with other DSLRs that are due a refresh in the future. Users can expect focusing in Live View to perform just as it does on the Z 6, with the added benefit of eye-detection AF and the option to select which eye the camera focuses on. Users get all the respective DSLR/mirrorless AF-area modes one could expect and the detection range of the AF system spans all the way down to -6EV in its low-light mode. The 51-point Phase-Detection AF system is sensitive down to -3 EV. By uniting Nikon’s latest EXPEED 6 image processor with the sensor, the D780 can shoot at 12fps in silent mode with Live View, however this drops to 7fps when it’s used in SLR mode with the optical viewfinder.
        The buffer is claimed to allow up to 28 Raw files to recorded continuously (or 100 JPEGs) before its limit is reached. Comparing the D780’s specs to the D750’s also tells us it offers a wider ISO range. Whereas the D750 shoots between ISO 100-12,800 (expandable to 50-51,200), the D780 has a sensitivity range of ISO 100-51,200, expandable to ISO 50-204,800. Shifting our focus to video, the D780 is now capable of in-camera 4K recording at up to 30fps using the full width of the sensor. Those wishing to experiment with slow motion can do so at Full HD at up to 120fps. Videographers will be pleased to receive helpful aids such as a peaking display for accurate manual focus, and zebra patterns to avoid overexposure, while microphone and headphone sockets are also built in and are located at the side of the body next to the mini HDMI, USB Type C and accessory ports. In-camera charging via USB, dual SD card slots (both UHS-II compatible) and wirelessly connectivity (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) round off the D780’s comprehensive set of features that’ll appeal not only to high-end enthusiasts, but also professionals who don’t require the super high resolutions offered by models like the D850 or Z 7. Nikon D780: Viewfinder and screen Very few changes are found at the rear of the D780. The button layout is identical with a line of five buttons arranged down the left of the screen, a four-way controller within easy reach of the thumb and a Live View button encircled by a stills/video switch. It inherits the same 0.7x optical viewfinder from the D750 that offers 100% coverage and the screen remains the same size (3.2in) and is the tilting type. It’s good to see touchscreen functionality added, which the D750 lacked, and the resolution of the screen has also increased from 1.229k-dots to 2.360k-dots. As for its build quality, the Nikon D780 has a dust and water resistant magnesium alloy body. This makes it just as tough as the D750 and those with eager eyes will notice a facelift to some of the dials and controls on the top plate. In all other respects the Nikon D780 is much of a likeness to the D750 and thanks to its deep handgrip, it feels very well balanced with small, lightweight lenses or larger, heavier telephoto zooms. Nikon has confirmed that existing D750 users who might own Nikon’s MB-D16 battery grip won’t be able to use it with the Nikon D780 as it’s not compatible. With regard to battery life, we’ve been told Nikon D780 users can expect to shoot approximately 2060 shots on a single charge. Nikon D780: First impressions The Nikon D780 is a blend of what we liked about the D750 , with innards adopted from the Nikon Z 6 and a few other improvements added for good measure. Having spent some time with the Nikon D780 during a press briefing, we can confirm its focusing in Live View performs exactly as it does on the Z 6 , while out of Live View it behaves and focuses just like the D750. For Nikon users who’ve invested heavily in F-mount lenses, aren’t ready to commit to mirrorless, but need a new, reliable and very capable workhorse, the Nikon D780 should fit the bill nicely. The improvements to focusing in Live View, the addition of touchscreen control and option to charge the battery in-camera address the criticisms we made when we reviewed the D750 back in 2014. First impressions suggest it has potential to be one of the best all-round DSLRs we’ve ever tested, but we’ll need to wait for our review sample to arrive before we pass final judgement. New Nikon lenses on the horizon At the same time as announcing the D780, Nikon has released a pair of new zooms. The latest arrival in the F-mount is the N IKKOR AF-S 120-300mm f/2.8E FL ED SR VR – a pro-spec zoom designed for sports and action photography with high-end DSLRs like the forthcoming Nikon D6 . Its arrival ties in with this year’s Tokyo 2020 Olympic games where many pros shooting Nikon will call for a fast medium telephoto zoom in demanding low-light situations. It features a complex construction of 25 elements in 19 groups and in addition to Extra-low dispersion (ED) glass, special short wavelength spectrum (SR) glass is used to combat blue fringing that traditional lenses typically have a hard time correcting. Claimed to offer a prime-like lens performance, it’s fully weather sealed, has built-in Vibration Reduction (VR) that’s effective to four stops, a memory recall button, works with all of Nikon’s 1.4x and 2x tele converters and features an integrated tripod foot. It’ll go on sale on the 23rd January and will cost €10,999. The second lens – the NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 S is more of a mainstream optic and has been included in Nikon’s Z lens roadmap for a while. It strengthens Nikon’s lens portfolio for its Z series cameras and is a lens many have been patiently waiting for. It has a construction of 21 elements in 18 groups and features Nikon’s special short wavelength spectrum (SR) glass in addition to ARNEO and fluorine coatings. Other key features include
        a weather sealed construction, 9-blade aperture, control ring, Fn button to which 21 different functions can be assigned, and 1m minimum focus distance at full telephoto (0.5m at 70mm). The NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 S accepts filters and adapters via a 77mm thread and it weighs 1360g without the tripod collar, or 1440g when it’s fitted. The lens is expected to be available to buy later this month at a price of €2799. We have already requested a sample of the lens so watch this space for our full review.'

      value: 'The Nikon D780 is a high-quality 24MP full-frame DSLR, and is still available new in the shops, plus there’s also good availability in the second-hand market. As one of the last Nikon DSLRs released, could it be one of the best Nikon DSLRs ? Find out in our full review: Nikon D780 Review: Introduction Nikon remains committed to its DSLR system although it is true that the D780, which was announced in early 2020, was its last F-mount camera introduction. In the meantime, Nikon has added no fewer than seven Z-mount models including the hugely impressive Z9 that has revitalised the brand’s standing among discerning photographers, reviewers and content creators the world over. Most recently, Nikon introduced the Z8 and it’s receiving rave reviews. Read what AP’s Andy Westlake thought about it in his extensive review here . Nikon D780: At a glance Whatever Nikon’s longer term plans for its DSLR family, there is no denying that the D780 has proved itself a skilful and highly featured camera that’s leading value for money too. In addition, for prospective buyers there’s a massive selection of F-mount lenses available and that’s a huge benefit. The D780 is still available new in the shops, but there’s also good availability in the secondhand market so that is an option to explore. The D780 arrived as the long-awaited successor to the D750 – one of Nikon’s most popular and best-selling DSLRs. Said to be the company’s most versatile DSLR ever, it profits from some of the things Nikon has learnt from mirrorless to make it an even better all-rounder. The question was; could the D780 attract passionate enthusiasts and professional photographers in a world inhabited by smaller, lighter and less expensive full-frame mirrorless cameras? In our review, the D780 certainly showed itself to be a very capable class act with every chance of success. Nikon D780 Review: Features Whereas the D750 had a 24.3-million-pixel full frame CMOS sensor, the D780 employs a 24.5-million-pixel full frame CMOS chip that’s understood, but not officially confirmed, to be the same as that used in the Nikon Z 6 . As well as having a low-pass filter to eliminate moiré and backside-illuminated structure to maximise its light gathering capabilities across an ISO 100-51,200 range (expandable to ISO 50-204,800), the sensor benefits from no less than 273 on-chip phase detection pixels to enhance its focusing performance in Live View. Although Hybrid AF systems aren’t new in DSLRs, it’s the first time we’ve seen a Nikon DSLR borrow an AF system for Live View from their mirrorless models. The outcome is that users get all the benefits of a fast, reliable Live View performance just like you do on the Nikon Z 6 and Z 7 with advanced functionality such as Eye-Detection AF while still being able to harness a 51-point autofocus system when shooting via the optical viewfinder. The 51-point AF system, which has 15 cross-type points, is the same as the D750’s and performs across a range of -3 to +19EV. Activating Live View sees this range extend to -5EV, or -7EV in low-light AF mode. Keeping on the subject of focusing, the 273-point Hybrid AF system covers 90% of the frame horizontally and vertically, whereas the focus points in the viewfinder remain tightly grouped towards the centre and don’t extend to the boundary of the frame. There are all the DSLR/mirrorless AF-area modes you’d expect, including single-point, 9, 21 or 51-point dynamic-area AF, 3D tracking, group-area AF and auto-area AF when using the viewfinder. As well as the customary AF-S, AF-C, AF-A and AF-F servo modes, Pinpoint AF for precise focusing in Live View is also available. There’s much more besides the changes to the sensor and focusing. With Nikon’s latest EXPEED 6 image processor on board the D780 can now shoot up to 7fps via the viewfinder, which can be increased to 8fps (14-bit) or 12fps (12-bit) during silent shooting in Live View. The shutter speed range improves on the D750 too. It now stretches from 30secs to 1/8000sec with the option to dial in shutter speeds up to 900 seconds (15mins) in manual mode. Exposure metering is left in the capable hands of Nikon’s 180K-pixel RGB sensor, which is inherited from the D850 . As we’ve seen before, it’s this metering sensor that’s used for subject-recognition purposes, which feeds information to the AF system for accurate and precise subject tracking. Also like the D850, the D780 can be used with Nikon’s ES-2 film digitising adapter to turn negatives or slides shot on 35mm rolls of film into 24MP digital files. Other new features include a greater selection of picture control modes, as well as a focus-stacking mode that can be used with focus peaking to create shots with a large depth of field by manually selecting the distance of each focus step. In typical Nikon fashion, the D780 presents a useful DX Crop mode. The camera automatically selects this when DX lenses are attached, but it can also be used in combination with FX lenses
        for those who’d like to gain a bit more reach at the long end. It uses a smaller area of the D780’s sensor, producing images with a 10.3MP resolution and 3936×2624 pixel count. Turning the viewfinder mask display on from the image area options darkens the area outside of the crop boundary to make it easier to visually see what falls within the frame. It can also be used when the image area is set to 1:1 (16.1MP) or 16:9 (20.6MP). Another advantage the D780 has over the D750 is its ability to record uncropped 4K UHD video that is downsampled from 6K capture. Frame rates for 4K include 30/25/24fps and slow-motion footage can be recorded at up to 120fps at Full HD 1080p resolution. Videographers will also appreciate the option of being able to record 10-bit footage in N-Log to preserve as wide dynamic range as possible, and with support of hybrid log gamma recording and timecode output via 10-bit HDMI, the D780 is a very serious tool for video. Adding to this is the option to shoot 4K UHD time-lapse movies in-camera and I’d recommend turning exposure-smoothing on, which effectively reduces variations between images to create seamless transitions. At the side of the body the D780 has three rubber flaps. The 3.5mm microphone and headphone ports are located behind the one at the top, there’s a separate flap in the middle for plugging in a remote release and beneath it you’ll find an HDMI Type C connector and USB Type C port that facilitates in-camera charging with compatible EN-EL15b batteries. As for wireless connectivity, the D780’s Bluetooth pairing and Wi-Fi options both work seamlessly with Nikon’s free-to-download SnapBridge app for iOS and Android mobile devices. Nikon D780 Review: Silent shooting Like the Nikon D850, the D780 presents several different ways of quietening the mechanical shutter. The shutter has a rather satisfying sound to it during day-to-day shooting when you’re using the viewfinder, but you do get the sense it’s rather loud when there’s not much going on around you. The Q and Qc modes on the mode dial are the quiet release shooting modes. These dampen the sound of mirror slap slightly and in Qc mode the D780 can shoot continuously at 3fps. To shoot even more discreetly, Nikon has implemented a zero-vibration electronic shutter that enables users to capture images in total silence when Live View is used. With Silent Live View Photography mode turned on from the photo shooting menu, there’s no noise whatsoever when you press the shutter button. Set the drive dial to its continuous high (CH) setting with silent live view mode turned on and users can shoot at 12fps without a peep out of the camera – great for wedding and wildlife shooters who want to shoot without disturbing or frightening their subjects. The only caveat to using Silent Live View Photography mode is rolling shutter, which can result in visible distortion of fast-moving objects. Nikon D780 Review: Build & Handling Photographers who have used the D750 will be familiar with the feel of the D780 in the hand, whereas those who are maybe looking at it as an upgrade from an entry-level DSLR will immediately sense that it’s significantly larger and heavier. Viewed alongside the Z 6 and Z 7, it looks as if Nikon’s mirrorless cameras have been on a lean diet of fruit and vegetables compared to the D780 that has been putting on the pounds and pumping iron, resulting in a more muscular appearance. Weighing 840g (body only), the D780 is 165g heavier than the Nikon Z 6 and Z 7. Although this may not seem like much on paper, I found the extra weight of the D780 noticeable when I switched between Nikon’s DSLR and mirrorless systems and had to carry them both for long periods of time. Extensive weather sealing and tough magnesium alloy body are to be expected from a model of the D780’s calibre and price. It’s an extremely strong and well-constructed camera, with a build quality that feels in the same league as the D850. It’ll allow photographers to continue shooting when the going gets tough or when challenging conditions persist. For anyone who has large hands and fingers, or isn’t particularly fond of the handling characteristics of smaller mirrorless models, the D780’s size won’t be an off-putting factor. The advantage that comes with having a larger body is that there’s more space for buttons, which don’t have to be crammed close together. Like the D750, buttons and dials are large and there’s a line of five buttons arranged vertically down the side of the screen, but not all of these are the same. In reply to customer feedback, Nikon has shifted the ISO button from the rear and positioned it between the exposure compensation and movie-rec button on the top plate for more intuitive control in combination with the rear dial. What was the ISO button on the D750 is now the metering mode button, which doubles up as a zoom out button in playback. Other button changes see the Live View Button that’s encircled by the stills/video switch
        shifted up so it’s in easier reach of the thumb. A new AF-ON button for back-button focusing is added alongside and the AE-L/AF-L button takes the place of where the info button was on the D750. The info button has since shifted down below the four-way controller and with no joystick; the four-way controller is used to shift the AF point during viewfinder shooting. It offers diagonal movement as well as left, right, up and down, but I did knock the lock switch by accident occasionally, which did cause me to wonder why I couldn’t move the AF point at times. The D780 no longer has a pop-up flash like the D750, however radio-controlled advanced wireless lighting is supported and the flash compensation button that’s located above the bracketing button allows -3 to +1EV control in P,A,S,M shooting modes. In most other respects it’s similarly laid out to the D750. Users can glance down at a large rectangular top plate LCD, it has an AF button below the lens release to take quick control of AF modes and the preview button and Fn button on the opposite side of the lens mount are both customisable. Nikon D780 Review: Viewfinder & screen There’s not a great deal new to report with regard to the viewfinder. It inherits the same pentaprism optical viewfinder from the D750, which has a magnification of 0.7x and offers 100% frame coverage. It’s possible to turn on a framing grid display to aid composition and I found myself assigning the Fn button to viewfinder virtual horizon, which loads a levelling guide on the horizontal and vertical axis to avoid shooting any wonky horizons. Unlike the D850 , there isn’t a switch to block out the viewfinder to prevent any light leak issues during long exposures, however the rubber eyepiece can be removed and replaced with the DK-5 eyepiece cover that’s supplied in the box. While the rear monitor remains the same size (3.2in) and tilts similarly to the D750’s screen, it improves by offering an improved 2.36-million-dot resolution and adds touchscreen functionality. Nikon’s recent touchscreens are known for their excellent response and accuracy. The D780’s is no different and lets you navigate your way through the main menu and select onscreen icons with the lightest of finger touches. Double tapping the display in playback mode also loads a 100% view, which is good way of checking focus. One thing the touch screen doesn’t let you do though is move the AF point with your thumb when the viewfinder is raised to your eye. Nikon D780 Review: Performance To get a good impression of how the D750 performs as a versatile all-rounder, I packed it as my main camera for a trip away to Iceland for a few days. The harsh conditions and sub zero temperatures it was faced with were up there with some of the most brutal I’ve experienced in my photography career, yet it didn’t flinch once and worked reliably throughout, which is testament to its solid, tank-like build quality. With no electronic viewfinder draining power from the battery, I found myself shooting around 1500 images a day and still had a couple of bars of battery power to spare for wirelessly transferring my best shots across to my phone back at the hotel bar. Nikon’s SnapBridge app has come a long, long way from the criticisms it received in its infancy. The Auto link that uses Bluetooth works brilliantly if you want every image you take to be sent to your mobile device and you’ll be prompted to connect via Wi-Fi if you’d rather select the images you’d like to transfer or fancy entering remote photography mode. Whereas in previous versions of the app the control was very limited, you can now take control of key exposure settings, white balance, P,A,S,M shooting modes and a self timer. Getting back to battery life, I didn’t quite reach the 2060 shots per charge that Nikon claims is possible – something I put down to the freezing cold conditions I was working in, however being able to shoot all day and not have to recharge on the go, or carry numerous spares, did make for a refreshing change to using a mirrorless camera. Operating the camera in Live View mode is a completely transformed experience. Autofocus speed and response is much improved. This, combined with touch focusing via the screen, makes it a pleasure to use when you want to work quickly from shooting angles that aren’t best suited to using the viewfinder. Setting up long exposure landscape shots on a tripod at waist level for example was a breeze. What does take some time to get your head around though is that the two AF systems are different and you don’t get identical autofocus functionality and performance in Live View as you do when shooting via the viewfinder and vice versa. For example, the AF modes you have at your disposal when shooting in AF-C mode via the viewfinder differ to those in Live View. You’ll find AF coverage is much more central when using the viewfinder too, whereas in Live View you can shift the AF target much closer to the edge of the frame. The
        speed of continuous autofocus (AF-C) in Live View is brisk, however tracking isn’t the easiest or quickest to setup in Auto-area AF mode so I veered towards using the 3D tracking mode via the viewfinder instead for subjects that weren’t too erratic in their behaviour. Sports and action photographers will be tempted to enter Live View to access the D780’s maximum 12fps burst mode, but my testing confirmed that you can expect to achieve a higher hit-rate of sharp shots in a burst at 7fps via the viewfinder using one of the dynamic-area AF modes. The other thing to factor in of course is that you’re at risk of introducing rolling shutter artefacts to shots using the electronic shutter whereas you’re not with the mechanical shutter. Face and Eye detection behaves similarly to Nikon’s Z 6 and Z 7 cameras’ running the latest firmware. Shooting a series of portraits demonstrated the D780 is extremely responsive at recognising faces and eyes in Live View, both in AF-S, AF-C and AF-A modes. You do however need to make sure the AF area mode is set to Auto-area AF. Users can specify which eye the camera focuses on and tell it who you’d like it to focus on in a group. Eye detection is disabled when using the viewfinder, but Face Detection continues to work well with the 3D tracking and Auto AF area modes. The next step for Nikon will be to make their impressive Face and Eye tracking available during video recording in Live View – something we’ve seen Sony achieve on the A7R IV . The D780 will appeal to a broad spectrum of users who shoot a variety of different subjects. As such, it’s important that it can process its data quickly and efficiently. One of the advantages of working with a 24-million-pixel sensor is that the processor isn’t overloaded by gigantic file sizes. Using an SDXC card facilitating 280MB/s read and 250MB/s write speeds revealed that it can happily shoot 100 continuous raw files at 7fps via the viewfinder before the buffer requires breather. The same number of frames were recorded when I switched to shooting Fine JPEG. With Live View and Silent mode activated I managed to record 54 Raw files at 12fps before the buffer became full. Shooting to a 64GB capacity card in the Raw and Fine JPEG format will give you around 860 shots to play with, whereas shooting in Raw only gets you closer to 1200 frames. Having the option to change the role played by a second card inserted in slot 2 gives the D780 an advantage over Nikon’s mirrorless models such as the Z 6. For a majority of my testing I had it setup to record Raw files to slot 1 and JPEGs to slot 2, but the spare slot can also be used for overflow and backup purposes. As far as image output goes, the D780 produces supremely impressive results from its imaging sensor that share much of a likeness in terms of colour, detail and dynamic range to the Nikon Z 6. There’s great scope when it comes to pulling back detail in dark shadowed regions and noise control in Raw files at high ISO is sublime. Nikon’s Natural light auto white balance mode produces faithful colour that is neither too cool nor too warm and should be the go-to White Balance mode when working in the great outdoors. JPEG reproduction impresses too. I found colour rendition is excellent, sharpening isn’t overly aggressive and users can dial back high ISO noise reduction if they’d like to create a slightly less processed look than the default ‘Normal’ setting applies. Nikon D780 Review: Image Quality The D780 plays a similar role to the Nikon Z 6 in the way it’s out to attract serious amateurs, enthusiasts, semi-pros and professionals who don’t require the same high-resolution output as Nikon’s D850 and Z 7 models that both boast a 45.7MP sensor. Our lab tests confirm that the D780’s sensor behaves identically to the chip found in the Nikon Z 6, offering impressive leverage when you’re required to pull back detail thanks to its wide-dynamic range. With virtually untraceable noise in images up to ISO 1600, users will find they can push high into the ISO range when challenged in low light, with ISO 12,800 and ISO 25,600 producing useable results. Nikon D780: Resolution The D780’s sensor puts in a comparable performance to the Nikon Z 6, with its 24.5MP sensor resolving a level of detail that we’d expect from a chip that features an optical low-pass filter to reduce the effects of moiré. At ISO 100, the sensor resolves 3200 l/ph, which drops to 3000 l/ph at ISO 800. The sensor manages to resolve 2800l/ph at ISO 6400, with 2700l/ph being recorded at ISO 12,800 and 2600l/ph at ISO 25,600. Pushing higher sees 2400 l/ph being resolved at ISO 51,200. The level of detail recorded at ISO 102400 (2000 l/ph) and ISO 204800 (1800 l/ph) underlines that these extended settings should be steered clear of. Nikon D780: Noise'

      value: Now cheaper than ever second-hand, is the ultra-simple Canon EOS 4000D / Rebel T100 a worthwhile buy? Audley Jarvis finds out in our review.
    - type: conclusion
      value: The Canon EOS 4000D provides a no-frills entry-point to Canon’s DSLR ecosystem for those on the tightest of budgets. Whilst now discontinued, like the EOS 1300D, this is one of the cheaper DSLRs on the second-hand market. In its favour the 4000D is very easy to use and capable of good image quality. That said, both the 2000D and especially the 250D provide better image quality and more growing space for first-time DSLR buyers to develop their skills, and are also available second-hand making them an obviously better choice.

      value: 'The Canon EOS 4000D or Rebel T100 (its two names in the UK and the USA, respectively) represents a bygone era of ultra-cheap entry-level DSLRs. It’s getting harder to find, but the bargain prices may make it one of the best Canon DSLRs for those on a tight budget. Find out how it performs in our full review. Canon EOS 4000D / Rebel T100 at a glance: The camera originally arrived on the scene in 2018 with the EOS 2000D and EOS 250D , both of which had higher-resolution sensors and more features, with higher price tags to compensate. The EOS 4000D was designed to be the ultimate entry-level camera, giving an on-board option for those who wanted to shoot with a DSLR on an ultra-slim budget. Now, with a few years’ hindsight under our belts, we can assess how this strategy played out. Not all that well. The EOS 4000D didn’t last all that long before being discontinued, and it’s notable that there is no equivalent of the camera in the Canon RF and Nikon Z mirrorless lines that the manufacturers are pouring all their attention into – the cheapest cameras in each system are the Canon EOS R50 ($679.99 body-only) and the Nikon Z50 ($860 body-only at launch). It turned out there wasn’t a great deal of appetite for such a thoroughly compromised camera, even at an ultra-cheap price point., But let’s not get carried away. The Canon EOS 4000D is still a competent APS-C shooter that these days can be picked up for less than $200 / £200 on the second-hand market. Is it worth buying in 2023? Let’s dig into the features, specs and shooting experience and find out in our full Canon EOS 4000D / Canon Rebel T100 review. Canon EOS 4000D – Alternatives and Rivals As mentioned, there isn’t really a contemporary analogue to the Canon EOS 4000D, as the mirrorless market doesn’t really go in for ultra-cheap entry-level cameras. The 4000D’s stablemates, the EOS 2000D (or Rebel T7) and EOS 250D (Rebel SL3) , are still available second-hand and even new in some places, and time has been kinder to them. The EOS 250D in particular has gained a reputation as one of the best beginner DSLRs ever made, with a solidly fast processor, a decent amount of resolution, the ability to record 4K at 25p. It’s quite a bit pricier than the EOS 4000D, going for around $649 / £444 body-only, but it’s streets ahead. But what about from other manufacturers? The closest Nikon equivalent is certainly the Nikon D3500 , an absolutely stellar entry-level DSLR that is still well-regarded in the photographic community despite having been discontinued. It’s still available used for over $300 / £300 body-only, or over $400 / £400 with a kit lens. Mirrorless-wise, a good comparison is probably the Sony A6000 , which was the first entry in the APS-C A6XXX series, and can be picked up for less than $500 / £500. It offers a much faster shooting experience than the EOS 4000D, as well as a more fruitful upgrade path, with loads of lenses and some solid successor cameras like the A6400 and A6600 . Of course, it does bear repeating that the Canon EOS 4000D is the cheapest out of everything we’ve mentioned here. But does it do enough to justify the money you need to spend on it, however little that may be? Let’s dig in and find out. Canon EOS 4000D – Features The Canon EOS 4000D is built around the same 18MP APS-C CMOS sensor and Canon DIGIC 4+ image processor used by the two-year-older 1300D . While we can appreciate that Canon’s chief priority with the 4000D is to keep costs to a minimum, the decision to stick with such a relatively low-resolution sensor is a bit disappointing, as is the decision to pair it with the now very dated DIGIC 4+ processor. Native sensitivity ranges from ISO 100-6400 plus an extended setting equivalent to ISO 12,800. This is identical to both the 1300D and the 2000D, although the 250D can be extended to the equivalent of ISO 51,200 while the Nikon D3400 /D3500 offers a maximum setting of ISO 25,600. As per the 1300D and 2000D, the 4000D’s video recording abilities max out at 1080p Full HD capture at 30fps. This puts it behind both the EOS 200D and the Nikon D3400, both of which can record Full HD video at 60fps, and the 250D with 4K video. On the back the 4000D is fitted with a fixed 2.7inch, 230k-dot rear LCD display, which represents a significant downgrade on the 1300D’s 3inch, 920k-dot display. Of all the compromises Canon has made with the 4000D, we have to report that this has by far the most detrimental effect on the camera’s overall usability. While it remains perfectly functional for reviewing captured images or operating the camera in live view mode, display quality really isn’t great when compared side-by-side with the 3in, 920k-dot displays of the 1300D, 2000D and 200D. It’s not just the lack of screen resolution that lets it down; colour and contrast are both lacking. There’s no touchscreen functionality either. Above the display the 4000D is fitted with a pentamirror optical viewfinder that provides 95% coverage at 0.50x
        equivalent magnification – the same as the 2000D. While this is bright and clear, it is very small compared to those found on more expensive Canon DSLRs. Unlike the 1300D, 2000D and 250D there’s no dioptre adjustment wheel, which could be an issue for users who wear glasses. In addition to PASM exposure modes, the 4000D provides a fully automatic Scene Intelligent Auto mode for point-and-shoot duties alongside a Creative Auto mode for simplified depth-of-field control. The mode dial also provides a Forced Flash Off mode and six individual Scene positions: Portrait, Landscape, Close-up, Sports, Food, and Night Portrait. In terms of shooting and processing features, the 2000D offers Canon’s Auto Lighting Optimizer, along with the usual array of Picture Styles. Key Features Canon EOS 4000D – Body and design As with Canon’s other entry-level DSLRs the Canon EOS 4000D is housed within a shiny polycarbonate shell. While this provides some degree of protection it does leave the 4000D looking and feeling a bit plasticky. Compared side-by-side with the 2000D and 1300D you can see where Canon has cut corners. The lens mount is plastic, whereas the 2000D/1300D get a more durable metal one. Likewise, the mode dial looks to have been fashioned from a cheaper plastic and doesn’t have the knurled finish of the 2000D/1300D, while the thumb rest on the back lacks the textured finish of the other two models. As we’d expect, there’s no weather proofing either. In addition to its lower-resolution sensor, downgraded rear display and cheaper finish, another thing that sets the 4000D apart from the 2000D/1300D models is the removal of some physical buttons on the top plate. Whereas those cameras provide a dedicated on/off switch along with a button to activate the pop-up flash, the 4000D incorporates the ‘off’ switch into the mode dial and removes the flash button altogether; if you want to use the camera’s built-in GN9 flash you’ll need to raise it manually. Elsewhere, the 4000D sports the same button configuration as the 2000D and 1300D, with the only difference being that there’s a little more space between the buttons. Build quality issues aside, the 4000D does sit quite nicely in the hand thanks to its relatively deep handgrip and sculpted thumb-rest. With the 18-55mm kit zoom attached the camera also feels well balanced and easy to operate. The in-camera menu system has been stripped right back, so first-time users should be able to scroll through and find what they need without any issues. Canon EOS 4000D – Performance Autofocus through the viewfinder is taken care of via the same nine-point phase-detect AF module employed by the 2000D and 200D. This has been lifted straight from the 1300D and while it’s functional enough, it does feel a bit basic next to some of the Hybrid AF systems employed by many mirrorless cameras. The nine AF points are arranged in diamond formation across a large portion of the viewfinder, and while focus is quick and accurate in good light, performance does take a hit when light levels drop, especially when trying to use one of the eight non cross-type AF points to lock-on to your subject. In live view the 4000D’s contrast-detect AF system is painfully slow even when light is plentiful. So slow, in fact, that it actively discourages you from using it. Canon’s clever Dual Pixel technology resolves these issues and significantly improves overall focus performance in live view, however the cheapest Canon DSLR to offer it is the 200D. Image quality is something of a mixed bag, with the bottom line being that while the 4000D’s 18MP APS-C sensor is capable of delivering very good image quality in the right conditions, the 24MP APS-C sensors inside the 2000D and 200D/250D are capable of better. The supplied EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS III kit zoom is also highly susceptible to fringing on high-contrast borders. That said, first-time DSLR buyers upgrading directly from a mobile phone or small-sensor compact are unlikely to be disappointed by the 4000D and will undoubtedly benefit from a noticeable step-up in image quality. Indeed, for anyone who’s looking to primarily shoot JPEGs in one of the camera’s many point-and-shoot modes, the 4000D routinely delivers the same punchy image quality associated with more-expensive Canon DSLRs higher up the line. Colour is certainly hard to fault, and can of course be tweaked as you like via Canon’s various Picture Style settings. Resolution Set to ISO 100 and raw, the 4000D can resolve 3,200l/ph with careful processing. At its higher sensitivity settings, sharpness falls off rapidly, with ISO 3200 recording 2,400l/ph. The highest extended setting of ISO 12,800 resolves just 2,200l/ph. For JPEGs the results are generally around 200l/ph lower. Noise The 4000D provides clean results at low ISO settings, although a little noise creeps into shadow areas at ISO 800. By ISO 1600 fine detail starts to soften and at IS0 3200 image quality degrades much more noticeably accompanied
        by a muting of colour. At ISO 6400 this is more pronounced, while the top setting of ISO 12,800 produces soft, mushy images and is best avoided altogether if at all possible.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'With the RX100 VII, Sony has done what it does best, and crammed an astonishing amount of technology into a tiny package. Somehow it’s fitted a 24-200mm equivalent zoom, electronic viewfinder, tilting screen, 20 fps shooting and 4K video recording into a body that you can slip into a jacket pocket. Its new autofocus system is a genuine advance too, especially if you regularly shoot erratically moving subjects such as sports or children. This is, without doubt, the most accomplished pocket camera on the market. Unfortunately, though, the RX100 VII is also a glaring example of Sony doing what it does worst, and cramming complex features into an interface and body design that’s ill equipped to integrate them. Sometimes it’s merely unpleasant to use, but other times it feels actively obstructive. It’s a real shame that Sony hasn’t put the same effort into improving the RX100 design as it has into evolving its Alpha 7 series models. The big other question is whether you’re prepared to pay a huge premium for a bunch of advanced features you may rarely, if ever use. Its cheaper competitors may not have quite the same capabilities, but they’re really not that far off. So if you want a small pocket camera with a viewfinder for creative photography, then the Canon G5 X Mark II might be a better bet. Meanwhile if you just want a long zoom lens and decent image quality in a compact design, Panasonic’s Lumix TZ100 or TZ200 both deliver this at a much lower price. Ultimately, then, the RX100 VII is much the same story as its predecessor: incredible technology in a deeply flawed body design at an eye-watering price. And much as I said with the RX100 VI, I’d struggle to justify spending $1,200 / £900 on a point-and-shoot that’s so frustrating to use, no matter how good the results. But if you can afford it and are prepared to live with its flaws, the Sony RX100 VII is a phenomenally capable pocket camera.'

While it may share the same 24-200mm effective focal length, pop-up EVF and tilting touchscreen as its predecessor, the Sony RX100 VI , the new model introduced a new 20.1-MP, 1-inch type Exmor RS CMOS sensor to the series, along with Sony’s Bionz X processing engine. Sony RX100 VII – At a Glance Aiming it at the growing vlogging community, Sony also gave the RX100 VII a 3.5mm mic port, enhanced video features and a more sophisticated AF system. Sony revolutionised the pocket camera in 2012, when it released the original RX100 that employed a 1-inch type sensor to give significantly better imager quality compared to anything that had come before it. Since then, smaller-sensor cameras have lost favour with enthusiast photographers, with only Canon and Panasonic continuing to challenge Sony in this area of the camera market. Since then, Sony has released successive RX100 generations almost every year up until the RX100 VII debuted in 2019, while keeping all the older models on sale. The most significant updates came with the Sony RX100 III , which sported a large-aperture short zoom and a pop-up electronic viewfinder, and then the RX100 VI , which adopted a brand-new 24-200mm equivalent zoom. As of spring 2023, the Sony RX100 VII remains the latest iteration of the camera. Sony’s RX100-series compact cameras have always been at the top end of the price bracket, and the Sony RX100 VII became the most expensive to date with a retail price of $1,198 / £1,200 at its launch. This price tag has come down slightly in the three years since it launched. In the UK, you can now find the camera for around £850-900. In the US, its launch price is still the RRP. The problem, as is often the case with Sony, is this price tag puts it squarely at the top as the most expensive compact camera of its kind on the market. For comparison, Panasonic’s long-zoom Lumix TZ200 can be found for less than $700 / £600. Canon also offers an interesting competitor too, in the shape of the PowerShot G5 X Mark II with its large-aperture 24-120mm equivalent zoom and a price tag that’s nearly $100 / £100 lower than the RX100 VII. So how can the RX100 VII conceivably justify its astronomical cost? Sony RX100 VII – Features On paper, the RX100 VII has almost the same core specifications as last year’s model. It’s built around a 20-million-pixel 1in stacked-CMOS sensor that offers a sensitivity range of ISO 100-12,800. The lens is the same 24-200mm equivalent f/2.8-4.5 zoom, and the pop-up viewfinder and tilting touchscreen are unchanged. Indeed in one respect, the VII has gone slightly backwards, with ‘just’ 20 frames per second continuous shooting rather than 24 (which is still twice as fast as you’ll likely need). So what has actually changed? Most importantly, Sony has combined a new generation sensor with its latest Bionz X processor, and this brings a significant update to the camera’s hybrid AF system . It now combines 357 on-chip phase-detection points covering 68% of the frame with 425 contrast-detection areas. Sony claims that the AF acquisition time has reduced from 0.03sec to 0.02sec, and while that 1/100sec difference won’t be noticeable very often, it should help with fast-moving subjects. The new innards also eliminate viewfinder blackout during continuous shooting. What’s more important in practice is that you get the firm’s impressive Real-time Eye AF and Real-time Tracking systems , which in its recent cameras has proven to be incredibly effective at holding focus on subjects as they move around the frame. Set the camera to continuous focus and tracking, and you can almost forget about moving the AF area or changing focus modes ever again. Sony has also added an oddly-named ‘Single Burst Shooting’ option, which takes a burst of seven frames from a single press of the shutter button in very quick succession; either 90fps, 60fps or 30fps. The idea is that you then select one frame that catches the perfect moment, similar to modes we’ve seen on some recent smartphones. It can be combined with the self-timer in a bid to catch group shots where nobody’s blinking, but this requires a separate trip into Sony’s impenetrable menus to set up. Other additions include a comprehensive intervalometer function for timelapse shooting, as first seen on the Alpha 6400 earlier this year. As usual from Sony, the RX100 VII has an impressive video specification. It can record 4K 3840 x 2160 footage at 25fps with full pixel readout, which delivers highly detailed footage with no field of view crop. There’s a raft of additional advanced features, including S-Log2 and S-Log3 profiles for easier colour grading in post-production, Hybrid Log-Gamma for HDR recording , and super-slow motion video at
        250fps, 500fps, or 1000fps. Real-time Eye AF is also available during video recording , meaning the camera should keep human subjects in focus no matter how they move. At long last, there’s a microphone socket for recording higher quality audio, but with no hot shoe, you’ll need to use a bracket to fix one to the camera. Wi-Fi is built in for connecting to your smartphone or tablet, using Sony’s Imaging Edge Mobile app . This allows remote control of the camera from your phone, with a live view display and the ability to change most camera settings. Inexplicably, though, you can’t set the focus point by tapping on your phone’s screen, which is generally the second-most useful control after the shutter button. Also, while the app has a playback option, it doesn’t show the pictures on your camera’s memory card, but instead only those already transferred to your phone. To copy images you’re expected to browse them on the camera instead, and push them over by pressing the Fn button (which actually works well). Sadly, there’s still no in-camera raw converter for optimizing your images before sharing them. Bluetooth is also on board, but disappointingly is only used for geotagging your images. Unlike with Canon or Panasonic, you can’t use your phone as a simple remote release, or browse through your photos while your camera is safely stowed in your pocket or bag. Sony RX100 VII: Focal points The RX100 VII shares its core design with its predecessor, with the main changes being internal Sony RX100 VII – Build and handling While the RX100 VII gains new innards and features compared to its predecessor, in other respects Sony has recycled the same old design. Unfortunately, this isn’t entirely a good thing. On the positive side, the metal-shelled body feels reassuringly robust, and the clean lines make it easy to slip into a pocket. But Sony still hasn’t fixed any of the RX100 design’s many and varied handling flaws. As a result, the super-smooth body will try to slip through your fingers like a bar of soap at any inopportune moment, so you’ll need to use a wrist strap at the minimum. In fact the first thing buyers should do is add the stick-on Sony AG-R2 grip, which adds nothing to the camera’s size while vastly improving its handling. It should really be included in the box, or even better built-in from the start, but instead you need to pay £15 extra just to keep hold of the camera properly. As with the previous six RX100 generations, the latest model is also pretty horrible to use if you want to treat it as anything more than a basic point-and-shoot. A good camera should get out of your way and make it easy for you to change all the key settings, but the RX100 VII prefers to fight you every step of the way. The control dial on the back is awkwardly positioned, while the smoothly rotating one around the lens is awful, as it gives no tactile feedback at all. By default both do the same thing most of the time, which completely misses the point of a two-dial camera. The buttons are all tiny and difficult to locate by touch with the camera to your eye, with the most important exposure settings (ISO and exposure compensation) placed on buttons as far away from your thumb’s resting position as Sony could possibly have put them. Luckily, it’s possible to set the front dial to control exposure compensation directly. As on the RX100 VI, the zoom lever works just a bit too quickly, making it difficult to set precise composition. This speed is customisable, but only to an even-faster setting. You can get more precise control by assigning zoom to the lens dial, but this feels like a waste of the camera’s limited control set. Secondary functions are accessed from the well-implemented onscreen Fn Menu. Usefully, this can be customised separately for stills and video shooting, which will let you minimise trips into the huge, poorly organised and often cryptically-labelled menu system, that’s now ballooned to include over 170 settings spread across 35 sections. Thankfully you can build a list of your most-used settings in the My Menu section, and save multiple shooting configurations for recall from the MR position on the mode dial. Both are well worth taking the time to set up. One new interface update inherited from the Alpha 6400 is its My Dial function, which allows you to temporarily re-assign the two controls dial by pressing a function button. This should be a valuable feature, but unfortunately it suffers from the same fundamental flaw of not telling you what it’s doing during viewfinder shooting, which makes it surprisingly awkward to use. With other brands’ small cameras we find the touchscreen goes a long way to offsetting their handling quirks, but unfortunately Sony still hasn’t bothered programming it with many functions. You can select the focus point when you’re shooting with either the screen or the viewfinder, and double-tap to zoom into images during playback, then scroll around them to check focus and detail.
        But you can’t change any shooting settings, or make menu selections by touch. Given that Canon and Panasonic both have excellent, fully integrated touch interfaces, this is a poor showing from Sony. Overall it’s now impossible to ignore that the RX100 VII’s technological prowess has completely outgrown its body design and control layout. You have to question the logic of adding all its clever autofocus and continuous shooting features, if they take so long to find and set up that you’ve missed the moment anyway. Sony RX100 VII – Viewfinder and screen One area where the RX100 VII excels is when it comes to composing your images, thanks to its pop-up EVF and tilting screen. The latter’s double-hinged design means it can tilt 90° downwards for overhead shooting, or 180° forward for selfies or vlogging. Its main failing is that it’s not bright enough to be usable in direct sunlight. A super-bright Sunny Weather menu setting is available to help with this – I’d add it to the My Menu. Popping-up the viewfinder also turns the camera on, which makes perfect sense. Unfortunately pushing it down again turns the camera off, which is irritating given that you probably just wanted to use the screen instead. Thankfully you can disable this behaviour, but only by trawling through the menu to decipher ‘Function for VF close’ and set it to ‘Not Power OFF’. On a more positive note, the viewfinder itself is very good: the 2.36-million-dot OLED is bright and clear, and its 0.59x equivalent magnification gives a decent sized view. Its design is a considerable improvement on the Canon G5 X II or the short-zoom RX100s, as you don’t have to pull out the eyepiece after popping-up the EVF, or retract it before pushing the finder back down. But I still prefer using a finder that’s fixed in place and always available, like on Panasonic’s TZ models. Sony RX100 VII – Autofocus Sony’s big update this year, across all of its camera range, is its new AI-based real-time autofocus. Technically, the firm says that the RX100 VII now keeps track of the subject by analysing its colour, pattern and distance in real time, including face- and eye-recognition, while the camera conducts 60 autofocus calculation every second. The camera can seamlessly switch between focusing on the subject’s face and eye, and even hold focus if they turn away from the camera. Real-time Eye AF works for both humans and animals, although not at the same time. Instead you have to select in the menu whether you prefer your family or your pets to be in focus. Also, while Eye AF can be combined with focus tracking for humans, this isn’t allowed for animals, which is odd, as many pets have been known to run around a bit. Otherwise, Sony’s new AF system has real practical advantages. When photographing people, you no longer have to specifically enable Eye AF by pressing a function button – it just works all the time. The tracking mode is also incredibly good at sticking to your specified subject, no matter how it moves or you recompose your image. I found that this means you don’t necessarily even have to move the focus area around the frame – instead you can acquire focus and recompose, with the AF point sticking to the subject and keeping it in correct focus. With a camera like the RX100 VII that doesn’t have a dedicated AF area controller, this turns out to be a godsend. Out of the box, AF tracking isn’t enabled, and when you try to turn it on, the camera will first declare that you can’t, because you need to switch to AF-C first. But once it’s set up, it works really well, with autofocus being ludicrously quick, essentially silent, and highly accurate. Even with fast-moving subject the hit-rate is very high, and the camera is no longer prone to dropping a sequence of three or four frames slightly out of focus like its predecessor did. If you’d prefer to specify the focus point manually, this is still an option, and when you’re shooting with the rear screen, you can simply tap on the subject. But with the viewfinder you’ll need to either enable the Touch Pad function to use the touchscreen, or if this doesn’t work for you, press the button in the centre of the rear dial then use the d-pad to set the focus point. This is pretty clunky, but no zoom compact is really much better. Thankfully, you can now set the focus area to be displayed in red, rather than the invisible middle-grey Sony has favoured in recent years. Sony RX100 VII – Performance Just like its predecessor, in most respects the Sony RX100 VII is an exceptionally snappy performer. It powers up in about a second, and from then on responds instantly to all of the controls. In particular its high-speed focusing and shooting means that you should very rarely miss a shot, just as long as you can set it up in time. Auto white balance likewise does a very good job, and Sony seems to have reduced the tendency towards overly cool results in sunny conditions that I observed with the previous model. The JPEG colour has
        also been pepped up a bit, and the overall result is that the RX100 VII gives some of the most attractive files directly out-of-camera that I’ve seen from any Sony camera. In many cases I’d be perfectly happy to share them on social media directly, although some still benefit from brightening and colour-cast correction. I found the metering to be exceptionally reliable in the multi-pattern mode, so while the usual array of modes are available such as average and spot, I didn’t need to use any of the others. The electronic viewfinder gives a reliable preview of how the image should turn out, so you can apply exposure compensation if necessary. There’s perhaps a slight tendency towards underexposure in certain conditions, which means the camera generally won’t clip highlight detail. Sony’s Dynamic Range Optimiser function does a great job of bringing out shadow detail in high-contrast scenes. Like all compact cameras, the lens-shutter design is extremely quiet in operation. In fact if you turn off the various operational beeps and fake shutter sounds and engage the electronic shutter, the camera is completely silent. Thankfully in a welcome improvement over the RX100 VI, it uses the same subtle visual cues as the high-speed Alpha 9 to indicate when it’s shooting. The camera only has a conventional SD slot rather than the faster UHS-II type, so it can take a long time to record a burst of images to card, especially if you shoot 20fps bursts. This doesn’t have too much impact on operation, as you can still shoot more images and change many settings while the camera is writing. However you can’t initiate video recording until it’s finished, or adjust the flash or drive modes. The lens is an excellent performer, especially considering its relatively long range. It’s very sharp in the centre wide open, but the corners are slightly soft, particularly at the extremes of the range. As a result, you’ll want to close it down a stop or two when shooting scenes such as landscapes where there’s detail right across the scene. I’d avoid the minimum aperture of f/11, as it gives very soft images due to diffraction. Battery life isn’t great, with the small NP-BX1 rated for 240 to 640 shots per charge, depending on whether you use the LCD or viewfinder. To get the most out of it I’d recommend setting more aggressive power-management settings than Sony’s defaults, and making a point of powering the camera off after shooting. Even then, it makes sense to buy a spare battery and a charger to ensure you can get through the day. Sony RX100 VII – Image quality While the RX100 VII sports the latest generation of Sony’s 20MP 1in sensor, this doesn’t bring much obvious change in terms of image quality. So just like the RX100 VI it delivers highly detailed images at low ISO settings, while keeping noise fairly well under control at sensitivity settings up to ISO 1600 or so. The top ISOs are just about tolerable if you convert to black & white, but even then, visible banding artefacts can creep into shadow regions. This means that the RX100 VII has no significant advantage over other compact cameras with the same size sensor, including the Canon G5 X Mark II and the Panasonic TZ100 and TZ200 in terms of raw image quality. Instead the main differentiators between these cameras will be the lens, and for JPEG shooters, the in-camera processing. Sony RX100 VII – Resolution Looking at the JPEG output, the camera resolves around 3200 lines per picture height at ISO 80, with the camera’s processing blurring higher frequencies in a bid to minimise sampling artefacts. Switch to raw and this improves dramatically, with almost 3600 lph resolved in our chart test. As always, increasing the sensitivity results in a progressive drop in resolution, with 3200 lph achieved at ISO 400, and 2800 lph at ISO 3200. The top two settings deteriorate even more rapidly, with just 2600 lph attained at ISO 6400, and 2400 lph at the highest option of ISO 12,800. From the 100% crops below, multiply the number below the lines by 200 to calculate the resolution. Sony RX100 VII – ISO and noise At low ISOs the RX100 VII produces excellent image files with no visible noise and plenty of fine detail. There’s very little deterioration up to ISO 400, but beyond this, noise becomes more prominent and fine detail deteriorates. However you’ll still get entirely usable images at ISO 1600 if you don’t need to print them large. However at ISO 3200, fine low-contrast texture has essentially been swamped by noise. The top two settings really don’t look great, with lots of noise and some banding creeping into shadow areas. ISO 6400 might be OK when there’s no other option, but I’d steer clear of ISO 12800 completely.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'The first problem, though, is that you have to part with an awful lot of money for the privilege of owning one. With recent price reductions, it’s still a large sum to spend on what is essentially an upmarket point-and-shoot, and you’ll also need to budget for a handgrip, a couple of spare batteries and a charger, just to get through the day without dropping the camera or running out of juice. Much of this cost is down to Sony’s advanced sensor and processor technology, so if you expect to be making good use of the camera’s impressive speed, autofocus and video abilities, it could count as money well spent. But to me it’s overkill: the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS200 / TZ200 and DMC-ZS100 / TZ100 provide everything most users are likely to need at a considerably lower price. The other problem with the RX100 VI is that it’s just so fiddly to use. The clickless lens ring, tiny buttons and lack of any finger grip place it at precisely the opposite end of the spectrum to that other over-£1000 super compact, Canon’s PowerShot G1 X Mark III, which handles brilliantly but has a disappointingly short zoom range. Luckily, for all its failings, the RX100 VI can be made more tolerable by exploiting its extensive customisation options. Set the lens dial to exposure compensation, turn on touch-pad AF for viewfinder use, disable auto power-off when you push down the viewfinder, and customise the Fn Menu and My Menu, and it’s merely irritating rather than infuriating. Despite all my criticism, I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy the RX100 VI. In many respects it’s a brilliant camera, and more accomplished than the Panasonic DMC-ZS200 / TZ200 in several key areas. But personally, I’d struggle to justify spending so much on a point-and-shoot that’s so frustrating to use, no matter how good the results, when the Panasonic DMC-ZS100 / TZ100 and DMC-ZS200 / TZ200 are just so much better value. However if you can afford it, and are prepared to put up with its foibles, there’s no doubt that the Sony RX100 VI is a phenomenally capable pocket travel camera.'
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Sony Cyber-shot RX100 VI has now been superseded by the RX100 VII , and the RX100 VI remains on the market, at a reduced priced compared with the newer model. This may make the RX100 VI a great choice for the bargain hunters out there. Sony Cyber-shot RX100 VI – At a glance When Sony released the original RX100 back in 2012, it revolutionized the pocket camera at a stroke. With its 20MP 1in-type sensor giving vastly better image quality than the tiny sensors previously used in this type of camera, it made the competition obsolete at a stroke. Successive RX100 generations have maintained Sony’s technological lead, with the adoption of a tilting screen in the RX100 II, a pop-up viewfinder and large-aperture zoom in the RX100 III, 4K video in the RX100 IV and high-speed shooting on the RX100 V. The cost has also shot up along the way, but Sony’s solution has been to keep every model on the market at tiered price points. The cameras have remained consistently popular, and one will generally always show up on a list of the best Sony cameras . With the RX100 VI, Sony made perhaps its most significant change yet. In place of the 24-70mm equivalent f/1.8-2.8 zoom used by the previous three generations, it’s added a considerably longer 24-200mm equivalent lens, albeit with a smaller maximum aperture of f/2.8-4.5. Impressively, it’s done so while retaining almost the same small body size – the lens barrel is just 1.8mm longer. In the process it has become the first true competitor to Panasonic’s DMC-ZS100 / TZ100 and DMC-ZS200 / TZ200 premium travel zoom cameras . But it also risks confusing buyers: the RX100 VI is a very different beast from the RX100 IV, and any other company would have used a clearly different name. The other catch is the price. The RX100 VI is more than the Panasonic DMC-ZS200 / TZ200 ($579 / £679), which we already considered very expensive for this kind of camera, and over twice the price of the Panasonic DMC-ZS100 / TZ100. This is a huge premium to pay for its compact size and high-speed shooting capability, especially considering that the RX100 VI retains many of the same operational and handling flaws as its predecessors. Sony RX100 VI – Features In essence, the RX100 VI has all the same core features as the previous model, just with a new lens. So it’s based around 20-million-pixel 1in type sensor that employs Sony’s exclusive stacked CMOS design. This uses back-illumination technology for reduced noise, while sandwiching a secondary RAM chip onto the sensor for faster readout speeds. The sensitivity range is ISO 125-12,800, which is pretty much standard for this sensor size. Sony has used the same high-powered Bionx X processor as in its professional Alpha 9, backed up by a front-end LSI that enables fast data throughput. This results in a truly phenomenal continuous shooting rate of 24 frames per second at full resolution, with a 233-shot JPEG buffer, while continuously adjusting focus and exposure between frames. Just how many photographers will need this capability on a pocket compact is a different question. The Zeiss branded 24-200mm equivalent 8x optical zoom lens uses 15 elements in 12 groups, with 8 aspheric elements including 4 Advanced Aspheric lenses, and 2 ED glass elements. It may be shorter than either the TZ100’s 25-250mm or TZ200’s 24-360mm equivalent optics, but it has the advantage of a usefully-faster aperture at the long end, at f/4.5 compared to f/5.9 or f/6.4 respectively. Crucially, this means it should be less affected by the resolution-sapping effects of diffraction, so should give sharper results at telephoto. Low-light shooters would probably still do better to stick to the RX100 V and its shorter-but-faster f/1.8-2.8 zoom, while videographers will be disappointed by the lack of a built-on ND filter. However photographers who like to shoot portraits will gain more from the extra zoom than they’ll lose from the smaller f-number. The RX100 VI should give greater background blur than the RX100 V , along with more flattering perspective, if you can take a step or two back from your subject and zoom to 100mm or longer. Autofocus employs a hybrid system, with 315 on-chip phase-detection points that cover 65% of the frame, coupled with 25 contrast-detection areas. Sony claims that this brings the world’s fastest AF for a 1in sensor camera of just 0.03sec. High-density Tracking AF clusters focus points around moving subjects for increased accuracy, while Sony’s much-touted Eye AF is also onboard for shooting portraits. As usual from Sony, the RX100 VI has an impressive video specification . It can record 4K 3840 x 2160 footage at 25fps with full pixel readout, which delivers highly detailed footage with no field of view crop. There’s a raft of additional advanced features, including Hybrid Log-Gamma for HDR recording, and super-slow motion video at 250fps, 500fps, or 1000fps. This all makes the lack of any provision for an external microphone for high-quality
        sound even more perplexing. Beyond the camera’s remarkable core spec, it doesn’t sport much in the way of extras. For instance, there’s no built-in intervalometer for time-lapse shooting, and with the demise of Sony’s PlayMemories in-camera apps, no way of adding one except by plugging an external controller into the micro USB port. Likewise, there’s no in-camera raw converter for optimizing your images before sharing them. Sony RX100 VI – Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Connectivity Wi-Fi is of course built in, along with both NFC to quickly set up a connection with compatible Android devices. New to the RX100 series is Bluetooth connectivity, but it’s only used for geotagging your images, and disappointingly you don’t get any of the neat features it brings to the Panasonic TZ200 or Canon PowerShot G1 X Mark III. So you can’t use your phone as a basic, always-connected remote release, or browse through your photos while your camera is safely stowed in your pocket or bag. Sony’s PlayMemories Mobile app for Android and iOS does at least provide full remote control of the camera complete with live view display, and allow you to transfer images to your phone or tablet for sharing. But it’s relatively clunky and unintuitive and is now looking rather dated. For example you have to fire up specifically the remote control mode from the camera itself, and can’t simply take control from the app. You also have to choose between being able to push images from the camera to your phone using the Fn button, or being able to browse the card from your phone – most other brands happily let you do both. Sony RX100 VI – Build and handling While the RX100 IV uses a different lens to its predecessor, in other respects Sony has recycled pretty much exactly the same design. This, however, is a mixed blessing. On the positive side, the metal-shelled body feels reassuringly robust, and the smooth, clean lines make it easy to slip into a pocket , aided by the top-plate controls all being flush to the body. Both the flash and viewfinder pop up from the top plate, released by mechanical switches; it’s astonishing Sony has managed to fit them in. It’s just a shame Sony can’t make the camera weather-sealed like the Canon G1 X Mark III. That smooth body has its drawbacks, though: as usual for an RX100, it has all the assured handling of a bar of soap . At the very least you’ll need a wrist strap to save the camera when it inevitably slips from your grasp, and I’d strongly advise adding the stick-on Sony AG-R2 grip, or one of the multitude of third-party alternatives. But it’s ridiculous that you need a £14 accessory just to be able to hold the thing securely. The grip adds nothing to the camera’s size, so should be built-in from the start, or at least included in the box. When the original RX100 appeared, the excitement of seeing a relatively large sensor in a body design copied from Canon’s excellent PowerShot S series was tempered by the fact that Sony had managed to make a complete mess of the control logic. Six years and five generations later, it’s still a pretty horrible thing to use. A good camera should get out of your way and make it easy for you to change all the key settings, but with the RX100 VI, I usually felt like I was fighting against it instead. At least Sony has now added a touchscreen , meaning it’s finally possible to select the focus point quickly when you’re shooting with either the screen or the viewfinder. You can also double-tap to zoom into images during playback, and then scroll around them to check focus and detail. But it doesn’t do anything else: you can’t even change any shooting settings or make menu selections by touch. Compared to Canon and Panasonic’s fully-integrated touch interfaces, this just feels lazy; it’s as if the iPhone never happened. As a result, most of your interaction with the camera comes via the physical controls. They get the job done, but they’re far from brilliant. The buttons on the back are small and fiddly, and being flush to the camera’s surface, near-impossible to locate by touch with the camera held to your eye. The rear dial doubles as a 4-way d-pad, but while it’s one of the better examples of its type, it’s uncomfortably placed for viewfinder use compared to the TZ200’s top-plate dial, which falls much more naturally under your thumb. Likewise the key manual controls of exposure compensation and ISO are located on the ‘down’ button of the d-pad and the C button at the camera’s lower right corner, as far away from your thumb’s resting position as they could possibly be. So it takes lots of right-hand contortions just to change basic exposure settings : on a sensible camera these controls would be placed at your fingertips. Like most modern compacts, the RX100 VI also has a control ring placed around the lens . Out of the box it mostly does the same thing as the rear dial, which doesn’t make much sense. Luckily you can customize it to operate other functions instead; I set it for exposure
        compensation. Unfortunately, being smoothly-rotating it’s not very satisfactory for changing exposure settings, as the lack of any tactile feedback precludes quick ‘count the clicks’ changes, while also making it easy to knock inadvertently. This stands in stark contrast to Canon’s similarly-sized PowerShot G7 X Mark II, with its large buttons and excellent switchable clicked / clickless lens dial. Sony highlights the fact that the zoom speed is customisable , but even at its standard setting, I found it just a little faster than ideal for precise composition. The alternative setting is even quicker, and while this will get you from wide to telephoto very rapidly indeed, it won’t let you hit any intermediate point with the faintest degree of precision. As is often the case you can get finer control of the zoom by assigning it to the lens dial, but then changing exposure settings becomes even more of a trial. Secondary functions are accessed from the well-implemented onscreen Fn Menu. It’s clearly laid-out and quick to use, and can be customised for stills and video independently , which you’ll almost certainly want to do. This will let you minimise trips into the huge, poorly-organised and often cryptically-labelled menu system. Thankfully you can now build a list of your most-used settings in the My Menu section. You can also save shooting configurations for recall from the MR position on the mode dial, which is equally well worth setting up. After using it for a few weeks, though, I have to conclude that the RX100 VI’s high-end aspirations have completely outgrown its body design. If you’re prepared to treat it as a glorified point-and-shoot, with zoom and exposure compensation your main creative controls, then it works OK. But Sony really needs to work out a way of making all its clever technology much easier to access, and ideally rework the control setup completely. Sony RX100 VI – Viewfinder and screen One area where the RX100 VI has a real edge over its biggest rival is when it comes to composing your images. Not only is its pop-up EVF rather larger than the Panasonic TZ200’s corner-mounted example, its screen tilts too, while the TZ200’s is fixed in place. In fact its degree of movement is unusually large: a double-hinged design means it can tilt 90° downwards for overhead shooting, or 180° forward for selfies or vlogging. The screen’s main failing is that it’s not especially bright, so unlike the TZ200’s it’s not very usable in direct sunlight. A super-bright Sunny Weather setting is available to help with this, but requires a trip to the menu to activate – I’d add it to the My Menu. It also has a slight colour cast in the highlights, which is particularly visible when playing back black & white images. Popping-up the viewfinder also turns the camera on, which makes perfect sense. Unfortunately pushing it down again turns the camera off, which is irritating given that you probably just wanted to use the screen instead. Thankfully you can disable this behaviour, but only by trawling through the menu to decipher ‘Function for VF close’ and set it to the obliquely-titled ‘Not Power OFF’. On a more positive note, the viewfinder itself is really very good : the 2.36-million-dot OLED is bright and clear, and its 0.59x equivalent magnification matches many mid-range DSLRs or mirrorless cameras. Its design is a considerable improvement on previous RX100 generations too, as you no longer have to pull out the eyepiece after popping-up the EVF, or retract it before pushing the finder back down. This makes a surprisingly large improvement to the experience of using the camera. But I still prefer using a finder that’s fixed in place and always available, and on countless occasions I put the camera up my eye only to find the viewfinder wasn’t there. Sony RX100 VI – Autofocus Sony has re-used the same AF system that we’ve previously seen on both the short-zoom RX100 V and the RX10 IV bridge camera. I was extremely impressed by it on the latter, and it continues to work in much the same vein on the RX100 VI. It acquires focus on static subjects in the blink of an eye ; indeed it’s noticeably quicker than the Panasonic TZ200, which itself is absolutely no slouch. However it’s when you point the camera at a moving subject that the system really comes into its own. It can keep track of a moving subject, and more importantly keep it in focus , while shooting faster than any interchangeable-lens camera on the planet. Like the RX10 IV it will occasionally drift away from perfect focus for a frame or two, but it’ll quickly snap back. This kind of continuous-AF performance is remarkable for a pocket camera. Out of the box, the RX100 VI is set up to automatically select the focus point and decide whether or not the subject is moving. Sometimes it gets this right, but just as often it doesn’t, and at this point you’ll need to override its decisions. When you’re composing with the screen, you can at least tell the camera
        where to focus by tapping the subject, but bizarrely Sony provides no sensible way of selecting a focus point when using the viewfinder. To rectify this, you’ll need to either enable the Touch Pad function, which allows you to set the focus point using the touchscreen while you’re looking through the viewfinder . If this doesn’t work well for you, you can reconfigure the button in the centre of the rear dial to Focus Standard and set the focus area mode to Flexible Spot. But if you choose the latter, you can’t activate Eye AF for shooting portraits. The rear dial function is also reassigned to changing the focus area size, rather than exposure settings, whenever you enter focus area selection mode. Sony RX100 VI – Performance With all the processing power it has on board, you’d expect the RX100 VI to be an exceptionally snappy performer, and in most respects it delivers. It powers up in about a second, and from then on responds pretty snappily to all of the controls. In particular its high-speed focusing and shooting means that you should very rarely miss a shot. While the usual array of metering modes are available, I found the autoexposure to be sufficiently reliable in the multi-pattern mode that I didn’t need to use any of the others. Naturally you’re aided here by the electronic viewfinder giving a reliable preview of how the image is going to look, so you can apply exposure compensation if necessary. If anything, I saw a tendency towards underexposure, which means the camera generally won’t clip highlight detail. Sony’s Dynamic Range Optimiser function does a great job of bringing out shadow detail in high-contrast scenes. I’ve often found auto white balance to be unreliable on Sony cameras, but I had better luck with the RX100 VI, which generally gave more pleasing results. It even did well under conditions that some other cameras find confusing, for instance neutralising the green colour cast that’s found in the shade of foliage on sunny summer days. There’s still a slight bias towards the cool side on sunny days, though, and some users may also prefer to boost the JPEG colour saturation beyond Sony’s distinctly restrained standard setting. But in general, most of my JPEG files showed quite attractive colour rendition, but benefited from minor corrections in post-processing. Like all compact cameras, the lens-shutter design is extremely quiet in operation . In fact if you turn off the various operational beeps and fake shutter sounds and engage the electronic shutter, the camera is completely silent. But then you get no feedback from the camera that it’s actually shooting, so it could really do with the same kind of visual cues Sony has used in its high-speed Alpha 9 mirrorless camera. The camera’s slim frame means that there’s only space for a conventional SD slot rather than the faster UHS-II type, meaning it can take a long time to record a burst of images to card, especially if you shoot 24fps raw for a few seconds. This doesn’t have too much impact on the camera’s operation, as you can still shoot more still images or change most settings while the camera is writing. However you can’t initiate video recording until it’s finished, or strangely, change the continuous shooting speed. The lens is an excellent performer considering its relatively long range. Like most extended-range zooms it’s very sharp in the centre wide open, but less good in the corners, and you’ll want to stop it down to f4 or f/5.6 when shooting scenes such as landscapes where there’s detail right across the scene. In the middle of the zoom range the lens is simply stunning, giving excellent sharpness from corner to corner. Likewise at the telephoto end, the centre is still very sharp, although the corners are a touch soft at maximum aperture. Indeed in my side-by-side comparisons, the RX100 VI’s lens is so much sharper at 200mm and f/4.5 than the TZ200’s at 360mm and f/6.3 that in good light, you can get almost the same level of detail from both cameras when shooting distant subjects. One word of warning though; I’d avoid the minimum aperture of f/11, as it gives very soft images due to diffraction. One real weakness of the RX100, though, is battery life . The small NB-BX1 battery is rated for 220 to 240 shots per charge, depending on whether you use the LCD or viewfinder. But to get anything close to this in real-world use you’ll probably need to configure much more aggressive power-management settings than Sony’s defaults, and obsessively power the camera off after shooting. Even then, I’d certainly recommend buying a spare battery and an external charger to make sure you can get through the day. Sony RX100 VI – Image quality We’ve seen this sensor and processor combination in several Sony cameras now, so it’s pretty much a known quantity. As in the RX100 V and RX10 IV, it delivers highly-detailed images at low ISO settings, while keeping noise fairly well under control at sensitivity settings up to ISO 1600 or so. In
        terms of sensor output quality there’s no significant advantage over compact cameras with 1in backside-illuminated sensors, including the Panasonic TZ100 and TZ200. Instead the main image-quality differentiators between these cameras will be the lens, and for JPEG shooters, the in-camera processing. In the absence of raw support from Adobe, we’re basing our image quality assessments below on the camera’s JPEG files. Sony RX100 VI – Resolution Looking at the camera’s JPEG output, the RX100 VI resolves around 3200 lines per picture height at ISO 80, with the camera blurring higher frequencies in a bid to minimise processing artefacts. The resolution drops only slowly as the sensitivity is raised, with almost 3000 l/ph registered at ISO 1600. Above this it falls more rapidly though, to 2800 l/ph at ISO 6400 and 2400 l/ph at ISO 12800. In raw, I’d expect to see higher resolution at lower ISOs, but with the risk of false colour and aliasing. These tests were shot in the middle of the zoom range, at 50mm equivalent, where the lens is at its strongest. Sony RX100 VI – ISO and noise At low ISOs the RX100 VI produces excellent image files with no visible noise and plenty of fine detail. In typical Sony fashion, colours are reproduced accurately, but a little subdued compared to some other brands. There’s very little deterioration at ISO 400, but beyond this, noise becomes more prominent and fine detail deteriorates. However you’ll still get entirely usable images at ISO 1600, if you don’t need to print them large. At ISO 3200 fine low-contrast texture has smeared away all-but-completely, but colour is still maintained well. However the top two settings give image files that really don’t look great. ISO 6400 might be OK when there’s no other option, but I’d steer clear of ISO 12800 completely.'

      value: Tim Coleman reviews the new Ricoh GR IIIx, a compact snappy APS-C camera, with a new 40mm equivalent f/2.8 lens.
    - type: conclusion
      value: The Ricoh GR IIIx is a well positioned niche alternative to smartphones and big cameras, offering a wonderful mix of the two. I feel there is enough here to compel smartphone users considering a ‘real’ camera, and experienced photographers who want a ‘proper’ photographic tool in their pocket. If I’m going to bother using a camera instead of my smartphone, first and foremost it needs to deliver excellent image quality in any kind of light. This has been achieved in the GR IIIx thanks to its 24MP APS-C sensor, DNG raw capture and sharp 40mm f/2.8 lens. GR III owners can rest assured that the lens quality is as good in the GR IIIx, with sharp detail from centre to edges. And with that new longer focal length, focus fall-off control is greater, the GR IIIx being more capable of ‘big-camera’ looking shots than the GR III. Overall, I prefer 40mm lens because in addition to general scenes, portraits and macro feel way more achievable. Of course, there were times I wanted to be wider than 40mm and I’d happily have the 28mm GR III in my other pocket too! Who knows, having successfully realised the GR IIIx, perhaps Ricoh will take the Sigma Quattro route and introduce a telephoto version with a 75mm equivalent lens. The GR IIIx also handles really well. It has a rapid sub-one-second start up time, quick shutter response, comfortable single-handed operation and intuitive controls that has satisfied me as an experienced photographer, especially as I have got to know it and taken the time to set it up how I like. Crucially, this is a camera that slips easily into a trouser pocket – that’s no mean feat considering the Ricoh-quality optics and APS-C sensor on board. The GR IIIx doesn’t necessarily top the scores in a review format, but ultimately it is a camera than I can and want to have in my pocket all the time, and the impact its consistent presence has had on my creative life cannot be undervalued.

      value: Ricoh GR IIIx At a glance The new Ricoh GR IIIx joins a niche family of unobtrusive compact cameras designed to capture decisive moments, attributes that are particularly suited to street photography and every day life. With a 40mm equivalent lens, and an APS-C sensor, this camera should be capable of producing high-quality images, whilst also fitting in your pocket, but does it live up to the hype? Find out in our full review. Since its introduction in 1996, the GR series has evolved over numerous iterations from its pre-digital days all the way into its current tiny digital form. Now, treading totally new ground, the 24MP APS-C sensor GR IIIx sits side by side with the virtually identical Ricoh GR III, but it offers a new 40mm equivalent f/2.8 lens. In Ricoh GR tradition, the GR III has a wide 28mm f/2.8 lens with an angle of view akin to your smartphone’s primary camera. The GR IIIx’s new focal length is closer to a normal lens. In other words, the GR III captures what you can see, the GR IIIx frames your point of attention. Of course, there’s a place for each focal length. Do you naturally want to capture the wider scene or the details? I for one was more excited about this 40mm f/2.8 lens because it is generally better equipped for photography genres like portraiture and macro. Angle of view aside, the real selling point of Ricoh GR’s is their image quality and pocket-power. Of all large sensor, fixed lens, premium compact cameras around, none are as small as a Ricoh GR III, and size makes all the difference. There are more bells and whistles in cameras like the Fujifilm X100 series and comparable interchangeable lens cameras with a 40mm pancake lens attached. But all those larger alternatives require a conscious effort to bring along for the ride. Not the GR IIIx. Ricoh GR IIIx Features Features-wise, I must reiterate that the GR IIIx ethos boils down to size and quality. It fits in your pocket like a smartphone, while somehow packing an APS-C sensor. Yes, sensor size is what currently sets the GR IIIx apart from a similarly priced phone, although its lens quality and handling help, too. Here is a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor that is approximately 4x bigger than the primary sensor used for the wide-angle lens in a similarly priced £900 smartphone, like the iPhone 13 Pro . Sensor size is so important because a larger sensor realises image quality advantages over the computational modes of a small-sensor smartphone, for things such as depth-of-field control and low light performance. The new lens provides greater reach and framing can be further tightened to 50mm or 71mm via the crop mode. Image files are simply reduced in size to achieve this crop, although an optional 75mm tele-conversion lens is also available to extend those full-resolution 6000×4000 pixel files. The wide-conversion lens for the GR III is not compatible with the GR IIIx. I feel attaching any conversion lens at all muddies the Ricoh GR spirit. Given the GR IIIx is all about shooting handheld, 3-axis sensor-based shake reduction is very welcome, and is a feature not found in most rival cameras. Ricoh claims shake reduction offers around 3 stops of stabilisation, which opens the GR IIIx to more versatile and higher-quality low light shooting. The mechanism also helps keep the sensor clean. Given the lens’s f/2.8 aperture, I’m not entirely convinced about the usefulness of the built-in ND filter, which can automatically reduce exposure by 2-stops. Still, with the ND filter in play and the GR IIIx on a tripod, long-exposure effects can be created in daylight. There is little effort here to bamboozle with headline-grabbing shooting modes. The GR IIIx is comfortable in its own skin, offering useful features such as an intervalometer and in-camera multiple-exposure. With its longer 40mm lens, the macro mode feels more compelling on the GR IIIx than it does on the GR III. In this mode, the minimum focus distance is reduced from 0.2m down to 0.12m, and with the 71mm crop mode employed, you can get pretty darn close. In 2022, 4K resolution feels like the bare minimum for cameras that record video. Well, the GR IIIx focuses on photographers over those who do video, and makes no headway from the three-year-old GR III. It’s limited to Full HD, and there’s no external mic input. However, it provides frame rates up to 60p, meaning you can get smooth half-speed videos on the go. The shallow depth-of-field provided by that f/2.8 lens can also help videos stand out. Once you’ve been shooting images, it becomes second nature to look at them and have an editing session using the versatile in-camera raw Development. After tweaks to settings such as Picture Style and exposure compensation, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity provides a reliable connection to Ricoh’s free ‘Image Sync’ app (from my experience using a Google Pixel phone ) to upload JPEG images and even remotely control the camera. Focal points Ricoh GR IIIx Build and handling The majority
        of photographers that pick up a Ricoh GR series camera do so because of how small and discreet they are. Put simply, no other current APS-C camera fits in the pocket in quite the same way. You’ve heard the phrase ‘the best camera is the one you have with you’. That normally applies to a smartphone, but the tiny GR IIIx can consistently be that camera. Ricoh has maintained virtually the same size, weight and dimensions from the GR III despite the new 40mm f/2.8 lens. In fact, the cameras are practically indistinguishable, save for five extra grammes meaning the GR IIIx weighs a mere 262g with battery and card inserted. Normally it’s the lens that adds the most significant bulk in a large-sensor camera system, but here it’s compact thanks in part to a simple and effective 7-element optical construction. It’s a lens that extends when the camera is in use and retracts when the camera is off or in standby mode, where the GR IIIx measures 35mm deep. Side by side with a regular smartphone, the GR IIIx is both narrower and shorter. Its exterior is simple, giving off the vibe of a modest compact camera. I’ve been out and about plenty of times in public places with the GR IIIx and it feels as unobtrusive as a camera can be, like a phone camera. But appearances can be misleading, and the GR IIIx has a lightning fast start up time, shutter response, and offers plenty for experienced photographers to sink their teeth into. The shooting mode dial has PASM exposure modes as well as three custom shooting modes (U1, U2 and U3). Put in a little time, and the GR IIIx can be set up three ways to accommodate your choice of shooting style for specific scenarios, with immediate recall of the full complement of camera settings. For street photography, I set up U1 to use Snap Focus at a 2.5m distance (I’ll get on to Snap Focus later), auto ISO with a minimum acceptable shutter speed of 1/125sec, metering set to highlight-weighted and picture style set to Hard Monotone among other things. No need to individually select these settings manually, though if you thrice go down this route you will need to remember which custom mode is which! Watch out that the dial hasn’t shifted between times with the camera, as the lock is a tad loose. I acquired an optional thumb grip which is an excellent addition for single-handed shooting, especially in portrait format. The thumb grip also somewhat guards the rear dial from accidental knocks. But the camera operates comfortably without a grip, too. The rear dial is one of two dials used to adjust exposure, plus it can be pushed in to reveal a quick access menu for picture style, focus mode, metering, file format and screen brightness. These options are well considered, because I often wanted to tweak the focus mode and metering in particular and appreciated not having to trawl through the main menu to find these options. Battery life is a sour note. Those 200 shots sure go by fast, especially when Bluetooth is active and the screen is set to its maximum brightness. However, it’s a part of life with the camera that I didn’t mind, by packing an extra couple of DB-110 batteries (low-cost third party ones are easy to find). I also made it a regular practice to charge the camera, which can be done on the go via the USB-C port. After much time with the camera in and out the pocket, I wanted to protect the lens because the retracting covers can be pushed open. Personally, I’d opt for the optional lens protective cover over a camera case in order to keep the size down to the bare minimum. Speaking of accessories, the GR IIIx doesn’t come with much, though there is a wrist strap and USB-C mains charger included. Ricoh GR IIIx Viewfinder and screen The GR IIIx has an extremely capable 3in, 1.04m-dot touchscreen. I say capable because its touch function is spot on, being responsive and versatile for controlling everything from focus point selection to menu navigation and image playback. Its default brightness is OK, but it can be increased for clearer daylight viewing at the cost of draining the battery quicker. Every time I use the GR IIIx, however, there are occasions where I have cried to the heavens above for a tilt screen to aid viewing at awkward angles. I can accept other downsides to a camera that is so small because size means everything, but a tilting screen would in theory only add a few grams and a couple of millimetres to overall camera depth. The viewing experience is the primary design aspect of the GR IIIx that I would change. It also lacks a built-in EVF and sadly neither is there an option for one via the hotshoe. An optional alternative is the small optical viewfinder. Frankly, for a discrete snapper like this I can live without a viewfinder, but what it really does need is a tilt-screen. Autofocus A crucial learning curve with the GR IIIx regards focusing. You’ll need to develop both the handling and an understanding of focusing for the scene in front of you. Persevere to the top of that
        learning curve and you’ll feel like a gunslinging cowboy, hitting the target. You might not have heard of Snap focus before. It’s rather smart, offering multiple pre-determined focus distance options that range from 1m to 5m plus infinity. Not everyone can judge if a subject is, say, 2m or 3.5m away. Thankfully then, the preset distance can be temporarily overriden via touch focus. Pairing Snap and touch focusing became my natural choice for most scenarios, while I also appreciated that depth-of-field for the focus distance at any given aperture is displayed on screen in Snap Focus mode. Other autofocus modes are a bit hit and miss. There’s certainly an AF performance improvement from previous generation Ricoh GR models, but those that are used to the best performing autofocus systems will become somewhat impatient with the GR IIIx’s focus hunting, especially in low contrast light. Tracking AF can struggle to stick to your subject, while face and eye detection AF are not the most responsive I’ve used, either. Manual focus is controlled by the rear wheel (and not the lens ring) with the focus distance displayed on screen. You’ll need to power through multiple wheel rotations to shift those distances, which is great for micro adjustments but a real drag for extreme changes. Ricoh GR IIIx Performance Starting off the blocks like a 100m sprinter and with its immediate shutter response, the GR IIIx is ready to capture decisive moments. However, action photography is another matter. Its continuous mode of 4fps (approx) is limited to short raw bursts, though you can get as many as 150 JPEGs in a burst before the camera slows up. Sensor-based shake reduction aids hand-held shooting particularly at this sort of focal length, and the claimed 3-stops of stablisation should in theory enable sharp handheld shots using shutter speeds as slow as 1/4 sec. I got mixed results at this shutter speed – maybe 50/50 were sharp – whereas at 1/10 sec and with a steady hand I had a 100% success ratio. Elsewhere, evaluative metering does a solid job of getting a good all-round exposure with a risk of losing some highlight detail. After months with the camera, I have settled mostly on pairing highlight-weighted metering and exposure compensation. That way, I protect highlights and when the image appears too dark (which does happen with highlight metering), I can brighten things up quickly via the rear dial. Ricoh GR IIIx Image quality Once you have honed your handling of the GR IIIx – especially focusing and composition – it is an extremely capable snapper. The 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor boasts a wide ISO 100-102,400 sensitivity range which realises excellent image quality in all kinds of lighting conditions. I’ve tried all of the ISO settings and have found that ISO 100 to 1600 is essentially free of noise, up to ISO 6,400 still impresses, then beyond this setting image detail begins to suffer. ISO 25,600 is still acceptable, though I generally avoid it and anything higher. Dynamic range also impresses in daylight, with enough scope to recover detail from shadow areas in low-key highlight-metered images. However, brightening images by more than 2EV can reveal muddy shadow detail. For such a compact lens, the 40mm f/2.8 delivers excellent sharpness across the entire frame. Looking right into the corners of forest scenes and every branch and leaf is as sharp as in the centre of the picture. The lens is slightly softer at f/2.8 and f/16, though that maximum aperture is still fine and delivers numerous other benefits, including shallow depth-of-field for portraiture and macro scenes. Focus fall-off is where the 40mm f/2.8 lens becomes a more compelling all-round optic than a 28mm one. Place your subjects in a sweet spot within a couple of metres and you’ll get a lovely blurry background at f/2.8. Not only can you use this lens for portraiture, but a pleasant surprise is its macro prowess. The crop mode is useful for this close-focus photography genre and it’s genuinely possible to achieve a buttery smooth and round bokeh at f/2.8. The closer to your focus point, the larger those lovely bokeh balls can get. From my experience, there is no detrimental effect on image quality with the macro mode in play. The maximum aperture displays pronounced vignetting. The effect of vignetting is found at every aperture, but it is significantly reduced by dropping the aperture to f/3.5. Ricoh offers in-camera ‘Peripheral Illumination Correction’ to remove this distortion at any stage of the image-making process. Images are recorded in JPEG and/ or DNG raw format. DNG is universally accepted by software old and new and I’ve generally stuck with the GR IIIx’s raw format and ‘Standard’ profile. It’s a pleasant style in itself and a solid starting point from where extensive in-camera edits can be applied via raw Development. For example, I’ve often gone for a low-key feel as a starting point to daylight images, applying shadow correction and exposure compensation
        ±1EV to bring out tonal detail. The Hard Monotone style is also a perfect partner to highlight metering, deepening those shadows for a dynamic mood. I can’t remember the last time I had so much enjoyment in converting images to black and white. In fact, raw Development in general becomes a natural part of the GR IIIx process, especially considering how easy it is to then upload images on the fly to a smartphone using Ricoh’s ‘Image Sync’ app.

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'In a world where the compact camera market has been virtually wiped out by smartphones, the Tough TG-6 builds on its own niche in an area few smartphones are willing – or able – to go. It revels in its seemingly nigh-indestructibility and lives up to its name. As you’d expect from the small sensor, image quality isn’t world-class and there are better options for above-ground work. That said, if you want to dominate anywhere up to 15m below the water’s surface, without spending a small fortune, the TG-6 really shines and earns its reputation. Related articles:'

      value: 'OM System / Olympus Tough TG-6 at a glance: The OM System/Olympus Tough TG-6 was launched in 2019 and it’s still available from OM Digital Solutions which acquired Olympus’s imaging division in 2021 . It is widely regarded as one of the best underwater/adventure compacts on the market. With a current street price of $499 / £399 this point-and-shoot camera is aimed at those who want to take their creativity to inhospitable locales, such as underwater or areas bogged down with mud and dust, without spending thousands on professional cameras, lenses and pricey underwater housings. Laughing in the face of smartphones – responsible for the sharp decline of compact cameras sales – and standing apart from the likes of GoPro, the TG-6 sticks to its guns and keeps much of what make its predecessor popular while also adding a few subtle updates to the mix for a refined user experience. OM System Tough TG-6: Features As with the predecessor, the TG-5 , you get a 12MP 1/2.3-inch BSI sensor, 25-100mm (35mm equivalent) f/2-4.9 zoom lens and exceptional build quality, which we’ll explore further below. A raft of fun and innovative features makes their way over as well, such as Pro Capture, which records a short rolling (0.5s) ‘security’ burst of five images before you take your actual shot to help secure the perfect image. As with the TG-5 you can capture images in JPEG or Raw. The former is great if you aren’t comfortable editing your images and the results are punchy, vibrant and full of details. If you do want to tinker with post-production, you’ll appreciate the ability to capture Raw files. You can also record video up to 4k at 30p, as well as 120p at Full HD or even 480fps at 720p – great for slow motion footage. For those venturing under the waves the underwater modes now boast a fifth option – Underwater Microscope – that fills out the close-up options. You can also take advantage of the 1cm close focusing distance outside of the macro modes, and it really shines. One very welcome addition is a higher resolution 3in 1.04m-dot LCD (up from 460K). This is great for identifying fine details, and since the TG-6 lacks a viewfinder, you’ll be spending a lot of time here. It isn’t touch compatible, but with such a strong focus on underwater operation this continues to be justifiable. Finally, it wouldn’t be a Tough review without mentioning the suite of field sensors and GPS data continues to impress. This can imprint your metadata with specific location and time details – handy for image sorting and as an aide-memoir. OM System Tough TG-6 Key Features: 1 – Build quality – The TG-6 continues to uphold the gold standard for rugged compact cameras. For under £400 you get a camera that works flawlessly at up to 15m underwater and can withstand drops from head height onto solid surfaces. 2 – Ease of use – Embracing the point-and-shoot ethos, this camera makes unthinkable shots a reality. If you’re a veteran photographer looking for a holiday camera, you’ll instantly know your way around. If you’re completely new, however, menus and prompts will nudge you in the right direction for the perfect shot. 3 – Portability – For the entirety of this review, the camera has been stowed inside a coat pocket. That’s something we can’t say for our daily drivers. And since it only weighs a smidge over 250g, it weathers its standby periods in relative obscurity. 4 – Features – Packing seemingly advanced features into compacts is nothing new, but OM System cameras have some great options to play with. Macro genuinely lets you get close up, Pro Capture will increase your chances of nailing action shots and Live Composite is great fun for light trails and night photography. 5 – Simplicity – In an age where we’re constantly demanding more from our tech, the TG-6 revels in its set-and-forget mentality. The options are there if you need them, but you can easily get away with choosing a single mode and snapping until your heart’s content. 6 – LCD screen – It may sound like an odd thing to praise a 3in 1.04m-dot LCD in this day and age, but given the previous screen was only 460k dots the increase really does create a better overall user experience when you’re framing and reviewing your images. OM System Tough TG-6: Build and Handling No one can deny the excellent design of the Tough series. This camera is built to be submerged up to 15m (or 45m with the additional PT-059 underwater case), withstand a 100kg crushing and drops from up to 2.1m in height – yes, it works! It’s also at home in temperatures as low as -10 degrees and comes with a dual-pane anti-fog design that prevents annoying lens fogging that occurs with sudden changes of temperature. To ensure the two compartments (charging and battery/SD) remain airtight the TG-6 uses a dual locking mechanism. It’s a simple but effective system and you can forgive any mildly annoying fiddling on dry land when it allows you such versatility. Despite appearing nigh-invulnerable, the TG-6 remains
        incredibly svelte and pocketable. It weighs in at a cheeky 253g, three more than the TG-5, and fits snugly in the hand. Excluding the shutter button, zoom and exposure compensation dial, your main point of control is on the rear of the body, with the D-pad offering the usual range of shortcuts, such as flash and drive mode. It’s compact, but easy to use even with thin gloves. OM System Tough TG-6: Performance and Image Quality Although there’s not a huge progression from the previous model , the TG-6 does what it sets out to do and does it well. The 1/2.3-inch sensor belts out pleasing images in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Images are vibrant and punchy with a good amount of fine detail, especially at f/2, and the AWB does a great job capturing natural colours. The 4x zoom 25-100mm lens offers an f/2 aperture at the wide end – great for darker conditions – dropping f/4.9 at longer focal lengths, which means the shutter speed will decrease and ISO increase to balance this out. The in-built flash can help offset any losses with close subjects and the ISO copes well up to ISO 1600, but beyond that noise becomes quite noticeable. Noise reduction is quite aggressive too, so we suggest turning that off if you want to get the best from your low-light JPEGs. There are some unfortunate ghosting effects when shooting toward the sun or a bright light source (the purple blobs shown above), especially at longer focal lengths. This will only really present an issue when shooting night scenes with street lighting or sunsets for example but can present with strongly backlit subjects too. We also noted that the images are slightly softer at the furthest reaches of the zoom lens losing detail on the edges of the subjects. It’s not a deal breaker and won’t be as noticeable for those viewing on social media, but it’s there if you know what to look for. Leaning into the point-and-shoot ethos you have a range of shooting options that offer everything from full to semi-automatic modes. If you want more control, then the ‘A’ (aperture) mode allows you to set the f-stop (you get four options) and the camera will fill in the gaps. SCN and the underwater mode – represented by a fish – give you a wide range of scenarios to choose from, supplying the best settings to match. This is great for users who aren’t interested in fiddling with settings when the shot at hand is about to swim away. There’s an exposure compensation dial, next to the shutter button, and we found this extremely useful since the metering tended to come up a bit on the bright side. Having the ability to drop to -2EV, thus informing the camera to darken the scene, really helped to get the most from our images. To ensure you get the best from your shots you have 25 contrast detection autofocus points that include a Single AF, AF Tracking and Face Detection modes. The base AF works well, though we found sticking with the central point and recomposing was easier than changing points. The tracking system is OK for slower subjects but struggled with faster moving targets. Similarly with the Face Detection mode which appears sticky but struggles with any more pacey movement. The new higher resolution screen is a nice touch. Composing your shots is simple and the display is extremely close to your final shot. It’s also bright and remains surprisingly visible when you’re working in harsh sunlight. Some of the controls, which sit screen-adjacent, are a bit on the small and fiddly side when wearing thicker gloves, but get your settings sorted ahead of time and you’ll be ok. Video recording: The video options are a nice addition and very capable for a compact. 4K gives crisp textures and punchy colours. The higher frame rates are nifty for slow motion, but it comes at the cost of decreased quality, with 480fps being extremely ‘fuzzy’ and prone to flicker (at 720p), and 120fps being available for Full HD. Autofocus will try and maintain focus throughout and does a good job if you’re moving slowly. As with tracking, faster subjects or camera movements tend to stump the system. The dedicated record button is also a touch recessed and easy to lose track of in the maelstrom, especially if you’re wearing gloves. If video is your main concern, you may want to consider action cameras like the GoPro Hero11 Black or DJI Osmo Action 3 that are designed with this in mind and come with their own raft of features and hands-free benefits.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ330 is a big upgrade over the FZ200, and has many useful new features. Judged against its main superzoom/bridge camera rivals, there’s certainly a lot to like about the newer model. First, it handles really well and feels solid enough to survive a few accidental knocks and bumps, with the added bonus of being splashproof for use in wet weather. The addition of touchscreen controls alongside a generous selection of physical buttons adds a good deal of flexibility to its operation too. While build quality, handling and operation all score highly, image quality is undoubtedly held back from realising its full potential by the small 1/2.3in sensor. However, that’s not to say image quality is poor. Under the right circumstances (for example, in plentiful and relatively even light), the FZ330 produces vibrant, eye-catching images that would easily survive being blown up to A4 or (at lower ISO settings) A3 size. When faced with high-contrast scenes, though, the limited dynamic range of the compact-sized sensor does result in clipped highlights and/or dark shadow areas devoid of detail. Similarly, shooting in low light or raising the sensitivity beyond ISO 800 produces images where noise becomes more obvious. While image sharpness impresses considering the wide focal range provided, the FZ330’s 12.1-million-pixel sensor can struggle with fine detail and produces the ‘smudged’ effect that is an all-too-common trait of small-sensor compacts. The FZ1000, with its larger 1in sensor, provides far better image quality and is currently only a little more expensive. Ultimately, while the FZ330 handles well and packs in plenty of appealing features to make it an attractive proposition, it can’t match the image quality produced by competitors with larger sensors.

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Superzoom/bridge cameras are a popular option for photographers looking for the flexibility of an ‘all-in-one’ compact camera that offers an extended focal range, advanced controls and a wealth of useful shooting features. Panasonic’s FZ range is well established within this genre and the Lumix DMC-FZ330 is the successor to the FZ200 from 2012. Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ330 at a glance: Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ330 Features At first glance, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ330 appears to retain many of the core components found inside the FZ200. For example, it employs the same 1/2.3in, 12.1-million pixel Live MOS sensor, and the same 24x Leica DC Vario-Elmarit optical zoom that provides the 35mm equivalent of 25-600mm along with a constant maximum aperture of f/2.8. The FZ330 does, however, benefit from an improved version of Panasonic’s Venus Engine image processor. The faster processor is actually a key upgrade that enables the FZ330 to deliver a range of features not found on the FZ200. Chief among these is the ability to capture 4K/UHD video (3840×2160 pixels) at either 25fps or 24fps in MP4 format, along with a generous range of 1080p full HD, 720p HD and 640×480 VGA capture options in both the direct-to-HDTV AVCHD format and more computer-friendly MP4 format. High-speed video recording options of 100fps at 720p HD and 200fps at VGA quality are also provided. In addition to 4K video capture, the FZ330 comes equipped with Panasonic’s innovative 4K photo mode technology that allows you to capture bursts of 8MP still images in a variety of ways. There are three options to choose from: 4K burst captures 8MP still images at 30fps for as long as the shutter button is held down, with just under 30mins total recording time available; 4K burst S/S (start/stop) mode also shoots at 30fps, but enables you to take your finger off the shutter button while images are being recorded, with a second press terminating the capture process; and 4K pre-burst mode makes use of the camera’s internal memory buffer to capture 30 frames from before the shutter button is pressed and a further 30 afterwards for a total of 60 frames. In addition, you can also ‘grab’ 8MP still images from pre-recorded 4K video footage in playback mode. The FZ330 also incorporates an electronic shutter that increases shutter speed from the maximum 1/4,000sec available via the mechanical shutter to 1/16,000sec in electronic mode. Sensitivity has been boosted too, with the FZ330 providing a native range of ISO 100-6,400, compared to ISO 100- 3,200 on the FZ200. JPEG images can be captured in a choice of three sizes (12MP, 8MP or 3MP), as well as two quality levels (standard or fine) and in a variety of aspect ratios. Raw capture is provided and the recent Adobe Camera Raw 9.1.1 update supports the .RW2 files. Users can process raw images in-camera too, although the options are limited compared to specialist editing applications. In keeping with its superzoom/bridge camera status, the FZ330 offers a generous range of exposure options, including the PASM quartet of semi and fully manual modes alongside Panasonic’s ever-reliable fully automatic iAuto mode and 24 individual scene modes. Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ330 Build and handling Unlike its predecessor, the FZ330 is dustproof and splashproof, which means it can be used with confidence in inclement weather. The general build quality is impressive, with the metal lens barrel and polycarbonate outer shell giving the camera a robust feel in the hand. At 691g with a card and battery, there’s a reassuring weight to it too. The ergonomic handgrip provides a secure grip, which is further aided by a sculpted thumb rest on the back of the body. Dials and buttons are plentiful, and are well spaced to prevent accidental selections. In addition to the usual array of direct-access buttons (such as WB, ISO, drive mode and AF/AE lock), the FZ330 features four physical function (Fn) buttons, plus another five Fn buttons on the right-hand side of the touchscreen, all of which can be customised to suit your requirements. On the back, the 3in, 1.04-million-dot LCD display represents a big upgrade and offers a generous degree of touchscreen control over the camera – something the previous model lacked. The EVF has also received a boost, with resolution up from 1.3 million to 1.44 million dots, and magnification is now 0.7x compared to 0.46x on the FZ200. While the automatic eye sensor is undoubtedly a welcome addition, one small niggle I found while operating the camera in 1-area autofocus mode was that my nose was prone to moving the autofocus box to the right-hand side of the screen while holding the camera at eye level. Of course, it’s possible to reposition the side-hinged vari-angle touchscreen so that it faces inwards to prevent this. Failing that, you can always turn off the touch AF function or switch the entire touchscreen off. Other than this, the FZ330 provides an extremely flexible way of controlling the camera, and
        for more advanced settings the main in-camera menu offers a comprehensive and neatly signposted set of options and customisations. Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ330 Performance The 24x zoom takes 2.5secs to travel through the entirety of its 25-600mm range, and can be controlled by the zoom switch that encircles the shutter button, or via the secondary zoom toggle on the left-hand side of the lens barrel. Lightly feathering the zoom, it’s possible to make very small incremental jumps of 1mm at the wideangle end, although this becomes more difficult at the telephoto end, where the incremental jumps tend to be around ±10mm. Thanks to the speedy new Venus Engine processor, image-processing times are very impressive. Used in single-shot drive mode with a Class 10 SDHC card inserted, it only takes a fraction of a second for the FZ330 to process and write image data to the card. Set to 12fps high continuous mode, it’s possible to capture 100-130 frames before the buffer fills and the camera begins to slow down. Autofocus performance is similarly quick, with the combination of Panasonic’s Light Speed AF and Depth from Defocus technology resulting in claimed focus acquisition times of just 0.09sec. In real-world use, focus acquisition times are certainly speedy. In good light, focus feels almost instantaneous, while in dimmer conditions the FZ330 still manages to maintain impressive AF speeds. Some focus hunting occurs in extremely dark conditions, though. The FZ330 offers a choice of AF-S, AF-C and AFF modes, with the latter designed to adjust focus to compensate for unexpected movements. For more erratic subjects, the subject-tracking AF mode works well, while face and eye-detection AF modes are also provided. Resolution Our resolution chart results reveal that the FZ330 resolves 2,400l/ph at ISO 100, dropping to 2,200l/ph at ISO 800. These resolution figures are fairly low, but they’re in keeping with the level of detail we’d expect to be recorded by a 1/2.3in sensor. At ISO 1,600 the sensor resolves 2,000l/ph, but there’s another drop at ISO 6,400 where 1,800l/ph is recorded. Dynamic range The FZ330 is let down a little by its dynamic range performance. The 10.5EV readout at ISO 100 is no match for the 12.2EV result recorded by the Lumix FZ1000 – a model that benefits from a larger 1in sensor – although it’s reasonable enough for a 1/2.3in sensor. Pushing to ISO 3,200 and ISO 6,400 sees the figure drop to 6.8EV and 6EV respectively. Noise The noise-reduction that’s automatically applied to JPEGs has the effect of smoothing out the finest details, so we’d advise FZ330 users to shoot in raw for the best results. A close study of our raw files revealed luminance noise starts to creep into images as early as ISO 200. By the time you reach ISO 800 luminance noise is much more obvious, with ISO 1,600 being the limit we’d happily push to regularly. Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ330 Focal Points'

      value: Canon's new PowerShot V10 vlog camera may look strange, but its design might just make perfect sense. Andy Westlake and Joshua Waller take a look
    - type: conclusion
      value: While Canon hasn’t made a new PowerShot compact camera for enthusiast photographers since the G5 X Mark II and G7 X Mark III in 2019, it’s dabbled with other less conventional concepts, in a bid to find new markets. The V10 vlogging camera follows on from the somewhat eccentric PowerShot Zoom ‘digital monocular’ and the PowerShot PX ‘automonous camera’, neither of which seems to have set the world on fire. But I think the new model has a rather better chance of finding an audience, not least because there’s a clearly established market for other vlogging cameras, particularly the Sony ZV-1 . Overall, though, I think the Canon PowerShot V10 is a bold and unusual design that has a real chance of making inroads into its target market. Only time will tell how that pans out in practice, but it’s always good to see manufacturers trying something different. For recording video out and about, the lack of optical image stabilisation could be a massive drawback, with most smartphones and cameras offering optical image stabilisation (and digital IS combined), which is massively better than just digital image stabilisation on it’s own. If shooting in conditions where HDR video is needed, the lack of HDR video support will mean that most smartphones will produce better video results, and these also have the benefit of significantly larger screens. For those looking to setup a budget priced studio camera, or perhaps record live music, the built-in stand, compact size, and relatively low price of the Canon Powershot V10 mean this a camera that could be a good choice, however, if you want to use it for 4K video recording, then overheating can massively limit recording time. However, if you only want to record shorter 4K videos, or use FullHD, and are mostly going to use the V10 in one place, then it could be a good option, and it’s currently one of the cheapest dedicated vlogging cameras available.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'It’s fair to say that the new Canon PowerShot V10 is quite unlike any other camera we’ve seen, and not just from Canon, but any other maker. Unlike all the previous models in the firm’s PowerShot range of compact cameras , it’s not designed for capturing still photographs. Instead this is a vlogging camera, which Canon says is designed to be an easy-to-use , all-in-one solution to videoing yourself, and uploading or live streaming to social media. As such, it’s direct competitor to the Sony ZV-1F , but with a very different physical design. The key point to understand about the PowerShot V10 is that it’s designed almost entirely for video – and in particular, videoing yourself. It’s also capable of shooting 20MP still images, but that’s almost beside the point. Currently, almost all the best cameras for vlogging look much as the same as the best cameras for photography , but are just used with the lens facing the opposite direction. Clearly, Canon has looked at all those people awkwardly pointing a stills camera design back towards themselves, and decided it’s time for a rethink of the camera’s shape and layout. As a result, the V10 is designed so it’s easy to operate one-handed , with a shape that makes it far more secure to hold. It can be used in either hand , with its prominent central record button falling nicely under your thumb, either left or right. It also has a flip-up screen and built-in folding stand , which allows the camera to be set down on a table at almost any angle. As a result, you don’t necessarily need to carry a tripod or grip. Crucially, the camera folds down neatly into a reasonably compact package, meaning it won’t take up much space in bag, and will indeed slip into larger pockets. Packed down with the stand and screen folded, it’s not dissimilar in size to a conventional compact camera, and it weighs just 211g . This design does results in certain compromises – the screen is very small, and there are barely any physical controls – but that might not be a problem for the target audience. So with that out of the way, let’s delve deeper at the Canon PowerShot V10’s features and design, and whether it appears to make sense for its target market. Canon PowerShot V10: Features Let’s take a closer look at the camera’s features. It’s based around a 20MP 1-inch type sensor, which is paired with a 19mm equivalent f/2.8 ultra-wide lens. Full HD recording is available at up to 60 frames per second and with sensitivities up to ISO 6400 , while 4K offers up to 30fps , with a maximum of ISO 3200 . Canon says it can record for up to an hour in a single take. Digital image stabilisation is available for hand-held shooting, but there’s no lens-based optical stabilisation. Autofocus is provided by contrast detection alone – there’s no phase detection onboard. But with this lens, that may not matter much. Audio is recorded via stereo microphones on the top plate, which naturally, Canon claims will deliver considerably higher quality sound compared to using a smartphone. There’s also a standard 3.5mm stereo input socket on the side, so you could plug in a wireless lapel mic if you wished. The mics are omni-directional and have an automatic electronic wind filter function. In the UK, the camera will come in as an ‘Advanced Vlogging Kit’ that allows the attachment of small windshields to each mic, via stick-on magnetic adapter rings. But this will inevitably obstruct the screen. Power is provided by a built-in rechargeable battery , while files are recorded to a microSD card . There’s a micro HDMI socket for video output, and USB-C port for connecting the camera to a computer, charging the battery, or powering the camera directly. You’ll need a USB-C PD supply for the latter, but Canon says you can use practically any USB power source for charging. The camera can also be used as a webcam when connected to a computer by USB-C, without any need to install additional software, and this worked perfectly once we’d set the USB connection mode to the “Video calls / streaming” setting. This supports Full HD video resolution at 30fps. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are built in for wireless smartphone connectivity via the Canon Camera Connect app. This allows you to control the camera remotely from your phone, and then copy your video across for sharing on social media. In addition, the PowerShot V10 can be used for live streaming when connected to your smartphone over Wi-Fi, in Full HD at 30fps and a choice of 6 Mbps for higher quality, or 3.5 Mbps when you have more limited connectivity, via the Canon Camera Connect app. However, you can’t record to card at the same time. Canon PowerShot V10: Operation and controls Where conventional cameras tend to be designed so you can easily change exposure parameters on a shot-by-shot basis, Canon has recognised that vlogging brings a very different approach. Instead, once the camera is initially set up and recording started, chances are it’ll be left alone for a while.
        So there are no dials and just minimal buttons on the back, with most aspects of the camera’s operation controlled through a suitably tweaked version of Canon’s familiar onscreen Quick Control interface. Given the small 2inch 460K touchscreen , displays are necessarily simple and uncluttered. Tapping the Q button on the lower right gives access to the main settings, while tapping the camera button top right switches between shooting video and still images. There are physical button for playing back your clips, or diving deeper into camera settings via the menus. As the buttons on the back are recessed, you’re less likely to press them accidentally when holding the camera facing towards you. Once you get into changing settings via the Q menu, the onscreen touch buttons do sometimes end up small and cramped, for instance for selecting video resolution and quality. Thankfully Canon’s touch interface is, as always, precise and responsive, so I didn’t find myself activating the wrong options. Others may find it all a bit too fiddly, though. Ultimately, it’s best to think of the Canon PowerShot V10 as a point-and-shoot vlogging camera that aims to be as simple as possible to use. Video performance Video options are relatively straightforward, with Auto, Smooth skin, Movie IS, and Manual Exposure modes. These are almost entirely self-explanatory, with Auto being the automatic mode, Smooth skin offering skin smoothing options, Movie IS being setup with digital image stabilisation (DIS) set to enhanced, and manual exposure being, you guessed it, for manual settings. The manual mode lets you adjust the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO speed. The options available vary depending on which mode you’re in, but you can also add colour filters, digital zoom, and adjust the colour tone. There are no high-speed video options available, which will disappoint some people. The lack of optical image stabilisation is noticeable, particularly if walking with the camera. The enhanced digital image stabilisation (DIS) gives the most stable footage, but even this is not enough if you are walking. It’s likely that ‘your mileage may vary’ depending on how stable you can hold the camera, or whether you’re using a grip, or gimbal setup. If you’re using the camera on a tripod, or using the provided stand, then this is much less important. For example if you simply wanted to use the camera at home for streaming or as a webcam, or were going to record video from a fixed location then stabilisation performance becomes almost entirely irrelevant. Audio quality from the built-in stereo microphones is good, with a digital wind filter giving some protection from wind noise. The ‘ Canon PowerShot V10 Advanced Vlogging Kit ‘ gives you, in additional to the usual box contents, a camera cage, a lens cap, a black textile case, and two mini windshields, which will help keep audio free from wind noise. When recording 4K video , the camera will warn you that the recording time may be limited if the camera overheats. When testing this, recording 4K video at 25fps, indoors, in a relatively low temperature room (<20C), we were able to record 22 minutes before the camera shutdown due to overheating. If you’re planning on recording longer than this, and live in a warmer location, then this could be an issue to be aware of. To switch between NTSC (60/24fps) and PAL (50/25fps) frame rates you have to go to the custom settings menu and switch between NTSC and PAL video systems. Why you can’t just select the different frame rates within the video settings menu, we’ll never know. Using the Canon Powershot V10 for stills photography Whilst you can use the Canon V10 for stills photography, it’s not really a good idea. If you do there’s no two-step shutter button, so you’ll have to use the touchscreen if you want to pre-focus to set the focus area. This means you may have to take a few shots, especially when shooting close-up objects, to make sure you get the right thing in focus. Results can look good, with Canon’s usual colour reproduction, which is very pleasing. Low-light performance is a lacking, with a noisy image produced, and low levels of detail when the ISO speed went up to ISO 3200. The shooting mode is entirely automatic, and the camera will automatically detect the scene. There are very few options available, and you can setup a self-timer, but beyond this there is only the image size and aspect ratio to change.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: When Leica first invited me to see the new Q3, I must admit that I wasn’t expecting all that much. This isn’t a slight on Leica, instead it’s testament to how the Q2 felt like an almost perfectly realised concept, and I couldn’t see how it could be dramatically improved. But it turns out that I rather underestimated Leica’s designers. While the new 60MP sensor improves image quality beyond the Q2’s already impressive levels, that’s arguably the least important of the major updates. I think there’s almost as much be said for the ability to shoot in raw at lower resolutions; after all, it’s not as if you need to make poster-sized prints all the time. But the dramatically improved autofocus and the tilting screen both bring significantly more to the table, in terms of expanding what the camera can do, how you can use it, and the kind of pictures you can successfully take. And they elevate the Q3 to being a significantly more capable photographic tool. Of course, you still get all the ingredients that make the Q series so tasty, including the classic design, traditional controls and superb build quality. I’m not entirely convinced by the aesthetics of the screen’s design, though; it’s a shame that Leica hasn’t made it fit flush to the camera’s back. As a result, the Q3 doesn’t look quite as elegant as its predecessor from some angles. But that’s a small price to pay for the additional shooting flexibility. Overall then, the Leica Q3 is a superb performer that’s lovely to use, and capable of producing fantastic images. It’s a very real upgrade over the Q2. Unfortunately, it’s prohibitively pricey for most photographers, but for those with deep enough pockets, it’s the best of its kind you can get.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Leica Q3 at a glance: Leica’s Q-series premium compacts are unique on the market, by combining a fixed prime lens with a full-frame sensor . Sony and Zeiss have previously dabbled in the same sector, with their RX1-series and ZX-1 cameras, but it seems only Leica has the cachet to sustain a genuine line. Following on from the Leica Q of 2015 and the Q2 from 2019, the new Leica Q3 brings a perhaps unexpected slew of updates and new features. Chief among them are a higher-resolution 60MP full-frame sensor, a tilting screen , and significantly upgraded autofocus . All the essential ingredients that define a Q are still present and correct, though. On the front, there’s a fixed, optically stabilised 28mm f/1.7 lens , whose barrel plays host to traditional manual focus and aperture rings. The body is styled to be reminiscent of Leica’s M-series rangefinders, including a stepped top-plate, shutter speed dial, and rounded ends. You also get a large corner-mounted electronic viewfinder. At £5300 , the Leica Q3 is anything but mainstream. Perhaps the nearest thing it has to a competitor is the Fujifilm X100V , which uses a similar design but a smaller 26.2MP APS-C sensor and a narrower 35mm equivalent f/2 lens, for £1,350. There’s also the pocket-sized Ricoh GR III for £949, with its 24MP APS-C sensor and 28mm equivalent f/2.8 lens. But this offers a very different shooting experience, as it has a fixed screen and no viewfinder. However, while the Q3 may be very pricey, it’s nowhere near as expensive as Leica’s classic M11 rangefinder , which costs £7,500 before you even add a lens. So what is it that makes the Q3 so special? Leica Q3: Features Let’s look at the Leica Q3’s photographic specifications in more detail. Firstly, it uses a variant of the excellent 60MP full-frame BSI-CMOS sensor that we previously saw in the M11. But here, it includes phase detection elements for autofocus, which means it’s presumably even more closely related to those used in the Sony Alpha A7R IV / A7R V and Sigma fp L . As on the M11, you don’t have to shoot in full resolution all the time, but can also record both JPEG and raw files at either 36MP or 18MP , when you don’t need such huge levels of detail and would rather save on card space. In concert with the new Maestro IV processor, the sensor offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-100,000 , plus a ‘pulled’ ISO 50 setting. It also enables continuous shooting at up to 4 frames per second with continuous AF, and 15 frames per second with focus fixed, with a buffer of at least 63 shots in raw. Shutter speeds are available from 120sec to 1/2000sec using the in-lens mechanical shutter, extending to 1/16,000sec using the electronic shutter. For long exposures, you get a handy ‘T’ mode, which is far more convenient than the usual Bulb option, as one press of the button starts the exposure and a second ends it. The new sensor also facilitates an addition to the camera’s Digital Zoom mode. This exploits the high-resolution sensor to enable in-camera cropping to match a familiar set of focal lengths.  The image area you’re going to get is indicated by a frameline in the viewfinder, with the camera recording both a cropped JPEG and a full-resolution uncropped raw file alongside. Along with the 35mm, 50mm and 75mm equivalent options already on the Q2, there’s a new 90mm setting on the Q3. These crop modes give 39MP, 19MP, 8MP and 6MP files respectively, which makes them genuinely useful – especially the 35mm and 50mm options. Turning our attention to the autofocus system, Leica has brought on board plenty of extra ‘L 2 ’ technology from its strategic alliance with Panasonic. Not only does the Q3 now include phase detection , promising five times quicker autofocus, it also gains subject recognition for people and animals. Interestingly, Leica says it also exploits Panasonic’s depth-from-defocus (DFD) system to build up a depth map of the scene. Other features new to the Q series include an intelligent Dynamic Range (iDR) option, which aims to boost JPEG shadow detail in high-contrast situations. There’s also a new Perspective Control option for fixing converging verticals, which previously appeared on the M11. When the camera is pointed upwards, it automatically detects the angle, which allows it to produce geometrically corrected JPEG files without any user input. But the really clever bit is that it draws trapezoid-shaped framelines live in the viewfinder (or onscreen), indicating the area that’ll end up in the final image. Another big update comes with regards to video , with the camera now supporting 8K recording at 30fps, 4K at 60 fps, or Full HD at 120fps. Leica has added an HDMI output for connecting to an external monitor or recorder and a USB-C port for power. Other advanced video features include ProRes recording, Leica’s L-log profile, and LUT compatibility. All of this makes it a surprise that there’s no microphone socket for higher quality sound. Leica is promising
        a firmware update that will allow audio input via the USB-C port, and suggests that in the meantime, you can use an external recorder. When it comes to connectivity , both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are built-in for use with the Leica Fotos app for Android and iOS. This gives full remote control over the camera and allows both images and videos to be copied to your phone for sharing. Unusually, the camera can also be wired directly to iOS devices using Leica’s proprietary USB-C Lightning cable, which should give a more stable connection. Unfortunately, Android users have no such luck. Leica Q3 key features: Leica has maintained the essence of the Q design, while adding some compelling new features Leica Q3: Build and Handling From the front, the Q3 looks almost exactly like its predecessor, with the same classic styling. However, there’s a major change at the back, as for the first time on a home-grown Leica camera, the screen now tilts up and down rather than being fixed. This has knock-on effects on certain aspects of the control layout and handling. For the most part, though, the Q3 offers a very similar experience to its predecessors. Needless to say for a £5,300 camera, build quality is exemplary, with a robust all-metal body shell that includes weather sealing to the IP 52 standard. At 743g it’s pretty weighty, but still feels surprisingly comfortable and secure in your hands, thanks to the signature curved ends. Crucially, the tilting screen mechanism feels just as robust as the rest of the camera, too. All these key controls are well placed for shooting with the camera to your eye. The manual focus ring is lovely and smooth, while the dials operate with satisfying clicks. This brings a real tactile pleasure to using the camera, and makes it extremely engaging to shoot with. The tilting screen does, however, necessitate a change in the rear control layout , as there’s no space for the column of three buttons that ran down the left side of the screen on the Q2. As a result, the Play and Menu buttons have moved above and below the d-pad respectively, while the Fn button migrates to a position below the shutter speed dial, alongside a second unmarked Function button. In typical Leica attention to detail, the left-side of these two buttons is slightly raised, making them easy to distinguish by touch with the camera to your eye. Pressing the Menu button first brings up an onscreen status panel, which provides a quick way of changing secondary settings quicky using the touchscreen. Subsequent presses cycle through the menu, which includes just six pages of settings. Despite this, the Q3 didn’t leave me thinking that anything important option is missing. Compared to the 49-page menu of the Sony ZV-1 Mark II that I was testing at the same time, it’s a breath of fresh air. As a result of this rearrangement, the Q3 operates a bit differently to other current Leica cameras, so existing users may need time to adapt. But it didn’t take long for me to conclude that this new layout counts as a clear improvement in terms of usability, as it brings all the buttons within reach of your right thumb, rather than requiring a shift in grip of your left hand to operate the Menu or Play buttons. I just wish the Menu and Play buttons were the other way around, to make the former that bit easier to press with the camera to your eye. Leica Q3: Viewfinder and screen For composing and viewing your images, the Q3 gains an upgraded viewfinder compared to the Q2, with a 5.76m-dot panel in place of the previous 3.69m-dot unit. It really is an excellent viewfinder, with a decently large 0.76x magnification and the option to switch between 60fps and 120fps frame rates, depending on whether you prefer to conserve battery life or see super-smooth motion.  Leica previews colour processing and exposure, and offers various ‘Capture Assistants’ including grid lines, electronic levels, a live histogram, and a zebra pattern overexposure warning. One oddity comes with respect to depth-of-field preview, which is completely unavailable in autofocus mode, as far as I can tell. However it is available all the time in manual focus, with the camera stopping the lens down to the taking aperture when you half-press the shutter button. It’s a strange operational quirk, but quite handy once you know realise what’s going on. For me, though, one of the Q3’s most important updates is its tilting screen . It’s great for a whole range of subjects, facilitating such things as low-level macro, discreet waist-level shooting for street photography, and the ability to maintain a better connection with your subject when shooting environmental portraits. I’d actually go so far as to say that it’s transformational to how you can use the camera. One small operational quirk is that while there are notches on the top and bottom edges of the screen to grab when tilting it, you don’t get any kind of grip on the side, which is common with similar designs on other cameras.
        It’s also worth noting that the screen only tilts up and down, rather than being a 3-way design like those used by Fujifilm , Nikon and Panasonic . So it’s of rather limited use when you’re shooting in portrait format. Clearly Leica wanted to maintain its usual build-quality standards without making the camera body too thick, and in those terms, I think it’s an acceptable compromise. Leica Q3: Autofocus Another aspect of the camera’s operation that sees a significant update is autofocus . Not only does the Q3 boast on-sensor phase detection, it also gains subject recognition for humans and animals. So while the Q2 was best suited to shooting static subjects, the Q3 can now also plausibly track focus on those that move. But it’s still limited by the speed with which the lens can adjust focus, so don’t expect it to keep up with fast, erratic subjects. Phase detection AF is available anywhere within the frame, with the camera offering multiple focus area options ranging from a fine spot to a multi-point zone covering approximately one-third of the image width and height. There’s also a conventional tracking mode based on pattern and colour, which like the subject recognition options, is accessed from the AF area mode. Alternatively, you can let the camera choose what to focus on. Switch to subject detection for people, and the system will recognise the body, face, and then eye as they get larger within the frame, which I found to be really useful both for portraits and street shooting. When the camera detects multiple possible subjects, it’ll outline the one it’s concentrating on in yellow and the rest in white, and you can switch between them quickly and easily using the d-pad. This all works just as we’d expect, with pretty quick, quiet and accurate autofocus. However, when you have time for slower, more considered shooting, the Leica Q is also a real pleasure to use in manual focus mode. In a neat bit of design, switching between AF and MF is done simply by twisting the focus ring, while pressing down a small interlock button on the focusing tab. The focus ring itself feels almost exactly like using a traditional manual control, despite operating electronically. Once you’re in manual mode, turning the focus ring automatically activates magnified view, which gives a choice of 3x or 6x settings. This is quite modest in terms of enlargement, especially given the 60MP resolution, but thankfully it’s assisted by a focus peaking display that highlights in-focus edges. It turns out that in practice, these two aids complement each other well, and I was able to get consistently accurate results very easily. Leica Q3: Performance Shooting with the Leica Q3 is pretty much a unique experience. With its fixed 28mm lens and analogue control dials, this isn’t a general-purpose, do-anything camera – instead it’s best suited to certain types of subjects. This also means that all aspects of its performance have to be judged accordingly. In practical use, the Q3 is fast, responsive, and essentially silent, which is great for such things as street photography or events. Its continuous shooting performance is more than adequate, given that it’s far from being the obvious choice for sports and action. I can’t see much reason why you’d ever set it to 15fps, but the option is there if you need it. However, the option to shoot at 4fps with autofocus is genuinely useful and works pretty well. I had no concerns about battery life , with Leica’s 350 shot per charge rating looking perfectly reasonable. The ability to top up from a powerbank during a break in shooting is very welcome, too. Just as we’ve seen with previous Q models, the lens is an excellent performer. It’s capable of resolving plenty of fine detail in the centre of the frame when used wide open at f/1.7, and just gets better when stopped down. At normal full-frame working apertures around f/8 to f/11, it’s seriously sharp from corner to corner. Diffraction takes the edge off the sharpness at f/16, but this is often an acceptable trade-off for the increased depth of field. Aberrations such as distortion and lateral chromatic aberration are corrected in software, leaving you with clean-looking images. I found the lens’s optical stabilisation allowed me to get consistently sharp results at shutter speeds as slow as 1/6sec. While this is certainly handy, the in-body IS systems in the latest mirrorless cameras can reliably go even slower. That said, the Q3’s combination of large aperture, effective OIS and strong high-ISO performance make it great for low-light shooting. Leica’s metering tends towards the conservative, which means that the camera generally does a very good job of protecting highlight details from clipping. Likewise, auto white balance is technically very accurate. Aesthetically, though, that’s not necessarily always what you want, and in many situations I’d prefer a warmer rendition. As a result, the camera’s output can look great in sunlight, but equally,
        it can be decidedly muted on dull days. Indeed, this isn’t a camera that I’d personally choose for shooting JPEG files. I’m not a big fan of Leica’s colour rendition , with the default Standard profile being rather muted, while Vivid veers too far the opposite way into over-saturation. However, this is very much a matter of personal preference. The conventional black & white mode is a touch too flat for my liking, too. But the exception is the high-contrast B&W option, which I liked a great deal, and used a lot. Just as with the M11, though, any shortcomings the Q3 may have as a JPEG shooter are easily forgiven the moment you start working with its raw files . Not only are they packed full of detail, there’s also immense dynamic range at low ISO settings. With files shot at ISO 100, I was easily able to pull at least four additional stops of detail out of the shadows without being concerned by excessive noise. In practice, this means that you can shoot directly into the setting sun and bring up foreground detail that’s invisible in the JPEG output. Of course, one objection to shooting 60MP DNG files all the time is the sheer amount of disk space they take up – my sample images ranged from 67MB to 100MB in size. But on the Q3, you can just drop the file size down to 36MP or 18MP without losing the benefits of raw. Even at 18MP, you should be able to make an extremely detailed A3 print. This is a neat feature with a real user benefit. One feature that I really appreciated was the Perspective Correction mode. We’ve seen various other in-camera means of fixing converging verticals, but nothing this simple and effective. It just makes perfect sense for shooting buildings, to the extent that you wonder why nobody else has done it before. But the real beauty of Leica’s implementation is that it’s just as useful for raw shooters, providing a means of visualising how you need to frame an image to include all the elements you want. Likewise, I’m a fan of Leica’s version of Digital Zoom . That 28mm lens isn’t ideal for everything, but the extreme cropping capability offered by the 60MP sensor helps make up for it. Again, it’s not just for JPEG shooters, but is also really a useful means of visualising how best to frame a shot that you’re going to process from raw. Leica Q3: ISO and Noise Due to its fixed 28mm lens, I’ve chosen not to test the Q3 with our standard test scene. Instead, I’m showing an ISO series of a different setup, which I shot using the 50mm digital zoom setting, giving 18MP files. Keep this in mind if you download and examine the full-resolution images. With its 60MP sensor, the Q3 can match any other full-frame camera on the market in terms of detail rendition. Not only does it give really excellent results at ISO 100, there’s barely any drop in quality at ISO 800, even when viewing files close-up onscreen. The very finest detail starts to blur away at ISO 1600, and noise has an ever-increasing impact thereafter. But even so, I’d be quite happy shooting at up to ISO 25,000 if the situation required, especially give the capabilities of the latest AI noise reduction software. But I’d avoid going any higher. Below are 100% crops from each ISO setting, shot in DNG raw and converted using Adobe Camera Raw. Click on any one to see the high-resolution version (18MP 50mm crop).'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Overall there’s plenty to like about the ZV-1 Mark II, but some question marks too. It brings major advances, but it’s not quite an unalloyed upgrade over the original. Even so, I’m sure vloggers will buy it – and love it – in their droves.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Sony ZV-1 Mark II at a glance: The new Sony ZV-1 Mark II is an upgrade to the firm’s original specialist vlogging camera, the ZV-1 . Introduced back in May 2020 , this repackaged technology from the firm’s highly regarded RX100-series advanced compact cameras into a new body design, while throwing in some clever, easy-to-use features specifically designed for its target audience. As a result, it rapidly gained a following among YouTubers as one of the best vlogging cameras available. Indeed, the ZV-1 proved such a hit that Sony has since expanded its vlog camera range, adding the interchangeable-lens APS-C format Sony ZV-E10 , the simplified Sony ZV-1F with a fixed wideangle prime lens, and most recently, the full-frame Sony ZV-E1 . All offer a similar design concept, but at wildly differing price points. Now the firm has got around to revisiting the original concept, with the new Sony ZV-1 Mark II complementing, rather than replacing the ZV-1 in the line-up. Without doubt, the headline change is the lens , with the new Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 6.9-17.6mm F1.8-4 optic providing a much wider angle of view, which Sony says is equivalent to 18-50mm in full-frame terms (although pedantically, it’s closer to 19-48mm). This addresses one of the major criticisms of the original, that its 25-70mm equivalent zoom isn’t really wide enough for arm’s length vlogging. However, such an ultra-wide view is unique for a zoom compact camera , which means it could also pique the interest of stills shooters for genres such as travel or landscape photography. It’s probably no surprise to learn that the catch is the price; at £870 , the ZV-1 Mark II is rather more expensive than the original, which is now available at a street price of about £670. So is the new model a worthwhile upgrade for vloggers, and should stills photographers be tempted too? Sony ZV-1 Mark II: Features Like its predecessor, the ZV-1 Mark II uses a 20MP 1-in type image sensor which measures 13.2 x 8.8mm. This means it’s rather larger than those used by most smartphones, but smaller than in any current interchangeable-lens camera. It offers a sensitivity range of ISO 125-12,800 as standard, which is extendable down to ISO 80. For shooting stills, the camera employs an electronic shutter only. This provides a top speed of 1/32,000sec, but limits the slowest setting to 1/4sec, despite the camera’s onscreen interface implying you can achieve striking long exposures of fireworks and flowing water. The continuous shooting performance is impressive, though, at 24 frames per second. As for the lens, it really is dramatically wider than its predecessor – in fact it’s surely the widest zoom lens that’s ever been built into a compact camera. However, the penalty lies with the aperture. That headline f/1.8 at wideangle may sound good, but it drops to f/2.8 by 24mm equivalent, and f/4 at 35mm. Overall the lens is equivalent to an 18-50mm f/5-11 on full-frame, which means you get little in the way of background blur at any setting. A switchable 3-stop neutral density filter is built in, but there’s no optical stabilisation – just electronic stabilisation for video. Of course, this really a video camera, and to that end you get 4K recording at up to 30fps , and Full HD at up to 120fps for slow-motion effects. The camera records in 8-bit 4:2:0 colour and should keep going for 45 minutes before the battery runs out. There’s a high-quality 3-capsule microphone built-in, which now offers a choice of directionality settings – either biased towards the front or the rear of the camera, or omnidirectional. A windshield comes in the box, which clips onto the camera’s multi-function shoe. This shoe will also accept Sony’s ultra-compact ECM-G1 microphone with a wire-free connection, and there’s a conventional 3.5mm stereo mic input, too. Sony has included a familiar set of vlogging functions, some of which get their own dedicated buttons. When Product Showcase is enabled, the camera will rapidly shift focus onto a product held up by the presenter, then back again afterwards. Meanwhile, the Background Defocus button toggles between shooting with the lens wide open to give a degree of background blur, and stopped down to f/5.6 for extended depth of field. There’s also Sony’s new multi-face recognition function, which will adjust the aperture automatically to keep multiple people in sharp focus at the same time. But with this lens, the effect of all these functions is rather limited. As with most recent cameras, the ZV-1 Mark II can be used as a webcam without needing to install any software. It’s also capable of live streaming to social media via its USB-C output, either to a computer or an Xperia smartphone. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are built-in for connecting the camera to your phone via the new Sony Creators’ App, allowing you to copy across and share your photos and videos. Sony ZV-1 Mark II key features: Sony has re-used almost exactly the same design and control layout as the
        original ZV-1 Sony ZV-1 Mark II: Build and handling In terms of design , the ZV-1 Mark II is a dead ringer for its siblings, the ZV-1 and the particularly the ZV-1F, which means existing users will be able to get to grips with it straight away. It’s a simple, boxy design, with a clean top plate that helps it slip easily into a pocket. Small grips on the front and front and back provide a reasonably secure hold both when pointing the conventionally camera away from you, and with it turned around the other way for self-recording. But I’d definitely recommend a wrist strap for security. There’s no change in the control layout , with buttons and dials kept to the minimum and equal prominence given to the shutter and movie buttons. In place of a conventional exposure mode dial, a button on top cycles between shooting stills, video, and slow/quick motion. You can then access the usual PASM or Auto options within each shooting mode. A conventional zoom rocker is positioned around the shutter button, with the background defocus button alongside. It’s easy for experienced users to deride this control, but I appreciated having a handy shortcut between shooting wide open and at f/5.6. On a lens like this, that’s something I’ll often want to do. There’s also a typical Sony control cluster on the back, including a small dial/d-pad for changing settings. Unfortunately, one flaw of the original camera that Sony hasn’t bothered fixing is how the power button is almost completely obscured by the windshield. One extremely welcome addition, though, is an easy-to-use touchscreen interface , which was sorely lacking from the original model. Sony has added a column of rectangular touch buttons down each side of the preview image, plus buttons across the bottom for exposure settings, in a layout that’s distinctly reminiscent of Canon’s Quick Control menu. Different options appear depending on whether you’re recording stills or video. It’s not too much of a stretch to say that this touch interface is transformative to the camera’s operation . I considered the ZV-1 to be actively unpleasant to shoot with, but in contrast, I found the Mark II to be much more user-friendly . Almost anything you need to access regularly can be changed easily by tapping on the touchscreen. What’s more, it works just as well for vlogging , when you have the camera facing towards you and can’t see any of the buttons on the back. However, while Sony tries to present the camera as easy-to-use, press the menu button and you’re drawn into a vast and mostly incomprehensible array of settings. Thankfully, the ZV-Mark II gets the firm’s latest colour-coded and better organised menus, which can be navigated and set by touch. But I still can’t help but feel that having 49 screens of options is over the top for this kind of camera. I’d set up a My Menu with the items you change most often for quick access. Sony ZV-1 Mark II: Viewfinder and screen Unlike Sony’s cameras designed for shooting stills, the ZV series has no eye-level viewfinder option at all. Instead, you use the fully articulated touchscreen to compose your shots and view them afterwards. It’s strangely rare to find such a screen on a zoom compact camera, and really rather welcome. Measuring 3in diagonally and with 0.92m-dot resolution, the LCD is some way short of the best I’ve used, but still perfectly serviceable. Sony previews colour, exposure, and depth of field, which gives a good idea of how your shots are going to turn out. The screen is bright enough for most purposes, and can be boosted using the ‘Sunny Weather’ menu setting when necessary. Unexpectedly, though, you’re not allowed to adjust its brightness in video mode, presumably due to power and heat management concerns. So it can be difficult to see when recording on very bright days. Sony ZV-1 Mark II: Autofocus While the ZV-1 Mark II doesn’t gain Sony’s latest autofocus system from the Alpha A7R V , it has the options that vloggers really need. You get face and eye detection for both humans and animals, along with a conventional tracking setting. But perplexingly, the camera is still incapable of recognising both humans and animals at the same time, so you need to decide in advance whether you prefer your family or your pets (that’ll be pets every time, right?). This AF system has been around for long enough now to count as entirely proven , and in general, I found you can just leave the camera to get on with things, safe in the knowledge it’ll get things right most of the time. Given the lens’s specifications, there’s not a huge amount for it to do anyway. But there’s a full array of manual AF area settings available too, if you prefer, which can be accessed easily using the touchscreen. You can also specify your desired focus point simply by tapping on the screen. Sony ZV-1 Mark II: Performance With the Sony ZV-1 Mark II, probably the most important thing we need to assess is the new lens . We’ve never seen a compact camera with
        such an ultra-wide zoom before, and it seems fair to assume that it’ll have been designed primarily for video, and therefore a 16:9 aspect ratio. So the question is how well does it work, both for video and photography? The first point of note is that, with its 18mm equivalent view, the lens really is wide enough for arms-length vlogging . Indeed if anything, it’s wider than it needs to be (and I’m well aware this camera will be widely used by people who aren’t six-foot-tall, long-armed males like me). I guess the idea is that it’s wide enough to use for group shots at arm’s length, but that just brings unflattering ‘fat face’ distortion at the edges. I suspect most people will benefit from zooming in a little. However, the flipside of that ultra-wide view is that the lens isn’t very good at blurring backgrounds (remember that unlike smartphones, ZV-series cameras rely on doing this entirely optically). Sony’s signature functions such as Background Defocus and Product Showcase still demonstrably work, but while the effects are visible, they aren’t especially impressive. Looking at the still photos I shot with the camera, it’s clear that this lens isn’t going to satisfy users who demand super-sharp results in the corners of the frame when examining files close-up. But on the other hand, my images generally looked sharp and detailed when viewed full-screen on my 24-inch monitor, and most photos are now shown on much smaller screens via Instagram or Facebook anyway. For video , 4K is less demanding in terms of resolution than 20MP stills, and the corners are copped away, which means everything looks fine. So for most real-world purposes, the ZV-1 Mark II’s lens is plenty sharp enough. It shouldn’t come as a surprise to find that if you want to make large, highly detailed prints, you’ll still benefit from a more expensive interchangeable-lens camera. Photo quality is much as we’ve come to expect from Sony, which is to say, decent without being outstanding. The firm tends to aim for neutral white balance and accurate, understated colour , which is a world apart from the warm, saturated images high-end smartphones usually deliver (and indeed that photographers have traditionally favoured). As you can see from the example above, JPEG files look fine in good light. Unfortunately, though, the camera can do nothing to lift even a slightly dull day, and it’s rare you can’t improve on the pictures with a little bit of effort. It’s also worth noting that with the relatively small-aperture lens and no image stabilisation for stills, the camera needs to use high ISO settings in low-light conditions, which will have a negative impact on image quality. As a result, this is a camera that’s best suited for shooting in reasonably bright light, rather than at night or in dimly-lit interiors. Video quality is good in terms of detail, but likewise suffers from slightly uninspiring colours. The electronic stabilisation is impressive, but hand-held footage can still look disconcertingly jittery, especially on a large screen. So as usual, serious users will still be best off using a tripod or gimbal. Audio quality from the built-in mics is excellent, though, and the supplied windshield is very effective for outdoor shooting. I was also impressed by how well the new directionality settings allow you to emphasise sound from in front of, or behind the camera as you prefer.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: In comparison, the Nikon Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S is an absolutely superb lens but it’s pretty heavy. It has a bulbous front element that means you have to use 112mm filters or rear gels and it costs more than £2,000. The Z 14-30mm f/4 S makes a great alternative that retails for almost half the price, is 165g lighter and has a wider zoom range, albeit it at the expense of a stop off the maximum aperture. As a fan of wide-angle photography, I’d be tempted to go for the 14-30mm lens, but 14mm can often be a bit too extreme while the 17-28mm range covers many eventualities. It’s also nice to have that extra stop on the aperture for low-light situations and even the occasional environmental portrait. Anyone who does opt for the Z 17-28mm f/2.8 will find that it’s a very capable lens that controls the usual flaws of wide-angle optics extremely well so that straight lines don’t bow, flare isn’t a major issue and there’s nice sharpness across the frame.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Like the Nikon Z 28-70mm f/2.8, the Nikkor Z 17-28mm f/2.8 is thought to be Nikon’s incarnation of a Tamron lens, in this case the 17-28mm F/2.8 Di III RXD. Being an ultra-wide-angle zoom lens, it makes it an obvious choice when looking for a lens for video . It joins the Nikon Z-mount line-up as the third full-frame zoom lens to cover the wide-angle range, sitting alongside the Nikkor Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S (£2,099) and Z 14-30mm f/4 S (£1,149). Unlike those two optics, the Z 17-28mm f/2.8 isn’t an S-line lens. This means it doesn’t have some of their premium features, but does it still have what it takes to appeal to the average Nikon Z-series photographer? Nikon Nikkor Z 17-28mm f/2.8 Features Nikon set out to provide a relatively compact and lightweight wide-angle zoom lens with a constant aperture of f/2.8. This goes some way to explaining why the Z 17-28mm f/2.8 doesn’t go as wide as the company’s other full-frame wide-angle zooms, or the 16-35mm lenses from some other brands. It’s also constructed from 13 elements in 11 groups with 2 extra-low dispersion (ED) elements, 1 Super-ED element and 1 aspherical element, with the special elements helping to keep the size of the lens down while maintaining high image quality across the frame. That large maximum aperture is especially useful for anyone interested in shooting in low light conditions or in isolating a close subject from its surroundings. It means the Z 17-28mm f/2.8 lens should appeal to keen astro photographers as well as landscape-shooters. Anyone with a full-frame Nikon Z-series camera is unlikely to be too concerned that the lens isn’t stabilised as their camera has sensor-shift in-body stabilisation. However, any photographers using it on one of Nikon’s APS-C format Z-series cameras which aren’t stabilised will have to take a little extra care to avoid the effects of camera shake. On APS-C cameras, the 26-42mm equivalent range provided, is arguably not especially useful on those cameras anyway, especially as the video crop will make it even tighter. Nikon Nikkor Z 17-28mm f/2.8 Build and handling Although it’s not one of Nikon’s top-flight S-Line lenses, the Z 17-28mm F2.8 is weather-sealed and there’s a rubber gasket around the metal mount to keep out dust and moisture. However, there isn’t a switch on the barrel to swap between auto and manual focusing, and there are no customisable L-Fn buttons to access favourite features. Unlike some of Nikon’s more high-end lenses there also isn’t a dedicated control ring, but the slim focus ring can be used to adjust the aperture, exposure compensation, focus or sensitivity (ISO) setting when the camera is set to use its autofocus system. In most cases, I use this to set the exposure compensation as I find it quicker to use the lens ring than the use a camera button and dial. The focus ring has a very smooth movement, as the focusing is by wire. There are no physical end points to its rotation. As usual, there’s no distance scale on the lens barrel, but one appears in the viewfinder or on the screen when the ring is rotated in manual focus mode. The zoom ring sits further towards the front than the focus ring and it’s much broader. This makes it very easy to locate when you’re shooting. It has four focal length markings: 17mm, 20mm, 24mm and 28mm. It takes just under a quarter of a turn to zoom from 17mm to 28mm. While the movement is smooth and assured, my personal preference would be for it to be just a little stiffer. Both the focusing and the zoom mechanism work internally. This means that the lens doesn’t change length during focusing or zooming. It also means that the front element doesn’t rotate, which is helpful for anyone using a graduated or polarising filter. At 450g, the Z 17-28mm f/2.8 is 35g lighter than the Z 14-30mm f/4 S , which has a 1-stop smaller maximum aperture yet a wider zoom range. It’s also 250g lighter than the Z 14-24mm f/2.8 S. This makes it more attractive for anyone trying to keep weight down (as well as cost), and for those using the lens for video. Autofocus I tested the Nikon Z 17-28mm f/2.8 on the 45.7MP Nikon Z 7II and other than to test the manual focus system, I had no need to switch away from autofocus. It focuses quickly and almost completely silently . It is sometimes a bit indecisive when the subject is close to minimum focus distance, but that’s quite common and not insurmountable. In most cases, I found a higher-contrast target close to the desired area for the autofocus system to latch onto and then recomposed with the focus point on my intended target. Once the focus is in the right zone, it usually gets the focus right quickly. However, if you’re planning to shoot a lot of subjects close to the nearest focusing point, it would be worth setting the manual focus ring to M/A in the camera’s menu. This enables quick adjustments to the focusing using the ring when the camera is in AF mode. When adjusting the focus from one extreme to another, you may notice
        a slight change in the framing of the image, but it’s not dramatic and unlikely to be problematic, although something to be aware of when recording video. Nikon Nikkor Z 17-28mm f/2.8 Image quality It might not be one of Nikon’s flagship lenses, but the Z 17-28mm f/2.8 still captures a very respectable amount of detail across the frame and throughout its focal length range. As usual, the centre of the image is a little sharper than the corners, but the drop-off isn’t worrying. The sharpness is also pretty consistent though the aperture range. I’d be happy to use any of the available settings (f/2.8-f/22), but if you want to get the very best results, then stick to around f/5.6-f/11. In the past I would have expected straight lines to bend like a banana when they’re photographed with a 17-28mm zoom lens. These days that’s something that can be dealt with in-camera or in post-capture processing. Of course, you can decide to turn off the correction profiles at either stage. However, it would be a strange decision. If you do so with the Z 17-28mm f/2.8, you’ll see barrel distortion in images captured at the 17mm end. You’ll see pincushion distortion from about 24mm to 28mm. Neither is especially troublesome, but it’s there if you have an aversion to correction profiles. Activate the profiles, however, and any straight lines are straightened. When the aperture is wide open, there’s some vignetting, even when the correction profile is applied. However, in many real-world shooting situations it’s likely to go unnoticed. Closing down the aperture to f/4 effectively eliminates any corner shading. Increasingly, when testing lenses, it seems that I have to really try to force the issue to capture any flare or chromatic aberration. The Z 17-28mm f/2.8 is a great example of this. I’ve scrutinised my images and I can’t find any with chromatic aberration, even when the correction profile is turned off. Similarly, flare is controlled extremely well , especially for such a wide lens and when shooting without the lens hood with sunlight passing over the front element. Of course, you will most likely see some if you point the camera towards the sun, but it’s contained impressively so the contrast doesn’t nose-dive there are only a few small hotspots.'

      value: Is the Nikon Nikkor Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR , a flexible vlogging lens for Nikon Z DX format, also an ideal choice for stills? Amy Davies finds out if it’s one of the best Nikon Z lenses available. Further good news is that the focusing mechanism is impeccably quiet to the point of silence – even holding it right next to my ear while holding it in a silent room I couldn’t hear it, so the chances of anything being picked up on a video recording are very slim indeed.

    - type: conclusion
      value: The OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 is a ultra-telephoto zoom that handles quite well although there are some niggling points. For example, the lens’ various switches are more awkward to get at when shooting in the portrait format. The OM System/Olympus lens also compares less favourably when compared with its direct rival, the Panasonic Leica DG Vario-Elmar 100-400mm /4-6.3 Asph Power OIS . It’s two-thirds of an f/stop slower than its rival at 100mm, it is considerably larger and heavier and lacks some useful features found on the Panasonic. However, both telephotos make our elite selection of the Best Zoom lenses for Micro Four Thirds . On the upside, the M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 can produce really attractive results, especially in bright sunlight, and its usability with the MC-14 teleconverter could well prove alluring to some buyers. With this accessory the lens becomes a 140-560mm f/7.1-9 which equates in the 35mm format to a very powerful 280-1120mm zoom. Overall, though, this is a capable lens, although its bulk is a negative when the strength of the Micro Four Thirds format is portability.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Micro Four Thirds format , championed by OM Digital Solutions (formerly Olympus Cameras) and Panasonic Lumix, is well supported when it comes to lens choice especially with telephoto lenses, where the format’s 2x crop factor is a big selling point. With a 100mm lens on the MFT format giving a view equivalent to 200mm on full-frame, the smaller format means telephoto lenses are effectively longer but also more portable which is a clear benefit to action and wildlife photographers. The OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS gives an equivalent view of a 200-800mm lens in the 35mm format and it weighs in at 1120g, a low weight considering its incredible telephoto power. It’s an optically stabilised ultra-telephoto zoom that joins the brand’s mid-range line-up, rather than its premium Pro series, and sells at $1500/£1169. There’s already a highly regarded telezoom of this range for MFT cameras, in the shape of the Panasonic Leica DG Vario-Elmar 100-400mm /4-6.3 Asph Power OIS which sells at $1298/£1199. You’d probably think that OM Digital has made a more portable alternative, given the lens’s slower maximum aperture, but it’s significantly larger and heavier. It weighs in at 1120g and measures 206mm when retracted compared with the Panasonic lens which is 951g and 172mm long. However, the lens’s trump card might be its compatibility with OM System/Olympus teleconverters. Fit the MC-14 which sells at $350/£299 and it becomes a 140-560mm f/7.1-9, and with the MC-20 attached, priced at $430/£399, it’s a 200-800mm f/10-13. With its credentials and potential, the M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS is an intriguing lens and a low cost option to other OM System telephotos such as the incredible $7500/£6500 M.Zuiko Digital ED 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro , but is it worth buying? OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS: Features Long telezooms tend to be optically complex, and OM System has used 21 elements in 15 groups, including four Extra-low Dispersion (ED), two High Refractive Index (HR), and two Super High Refractive Index (Super HR) glass elements to help keep optical aberrations at bay. OM System’s ZERO coating reduces flare and ghosting, and the diaphragm employs nine rounded blades to give a near-circular aperture, in a bid to provide attractive bokeh. While this is OM System’s third IS lens, it differs from the firm’s existing optics in that it doesn’t support Sync IS, in which the in-lens and in-body stabilisation systems work together for maximum effect. Instead, when the lens IS is enabled, the camera’s in-body system is automatically disabled (although confusingly, it’ll still appear to be active on the camera’s Quick Control Panel). With such a long telephoto, the optical stabilisation is likely to be doing most of the work anyway, so this isn’t perhaps as much of a loss as it sounds. OM System has released firmware updates for select camera models (E-M1X, E-M1 Mark III, E-M1 Mark II and E-M5 Mark III), primarily to add support for focus stacking with the 100-400mm. Interestingly, they also enable rolling motion around the lens axis to be corrected by the camera’s IBIS. This is good news to videographers, but probably won’t make a lot of difference for stills photography, because roll movement only contributes significantly to blur at much slower shutter speeds than are likely to be usable hand-held with this lens. For the latest OM System firmware downloads visit this page . Indeed at 800mm equivalent the optical stabilisation has an awful lot of work to do counteract the effects of camera shake, and as a result is rated to 3 stops, dropping to 2 stops when a teleconverter is fitted. This might sound meagre to OM System/Olympus users accustomed to getting considerably more from their camera’s in-body IS, but it’s worth bearing in mind that with most of the subjects this lens will be used for, you’ll generally need to maintain fast shutter speeds anyway, to prevent motion blur. As usual for a large telephoto, the 100-400mm includes a sturdy metal tripod mount. It rotates freely and can be locked in any position, with index markings (but not click-stops) at every 90°. In a particularly welcome move, an Arca Swiss-type dovetail profile means it can be clamped directly onto many tripod heads, while the collar can also be removed for hand-held shooting. However, some users may prefer the Panasonic lens’s easily removable, low-profile tripod shoe. The lens has a minimum focus distance of just 1.3m, providing a handy 0.57x equivalent magnification and facilitating interesting close-ups of subjects that might prove skittish if you approached them with a shorter macro lens. Filter users will find a 72mm thread surrounding the front element, while a deep bowl-shaped plastic hood is supplied in the box. OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS: Build and handling As befits its mid-range status, the 100-400mm employs plastic rather than
        metal for much of its outer barrel. But it’s still perfectly nicely made, and OM System says that it’s built with the same standard of dust, splash and freeze-proofing as its Pro-series lenses, which have proven to be extremely robust. Weighing in at about 1.4kg with the tripod mount and hood attached, and measuring over 20cm in length, this is one of the largest and heaviest Micro Four Thirds lenses. As a result, it feels distinctly front-heavy even on high-end Micro Four Thirds cameras. Users of the smaller OM-D E-M10 and E-M5 bodies will find themselves supporting the lens entirely with their left hand, and will benefit significantly from using an add-on grip for their camera if possible. Even E-M1-series users will likely appreciate the extra purchase afforded by a vertical grip. To me, the smaller and lighter Panasonic version matches the Micro Four Thirds philosophy better. Thankfully, the lens still handles quite well. The zoom ring rotates smoothly through 90°, with no change in resistance at any point. This is much better than the rather ‘sticky’ zoom found on its Panasonic rival when it comes to making fine adjustments. I had no problem with zoom creep, but a switch allows locking at the 100mm position anyway, with a white inlay to show its status. The front of the lens extends by approximately 6cm when zoomed to 400mm. On the left side of the barrel you’ll find a conventional control panel, with a set of well-spaced switches for limiting the autofocus distance range (1.3m to 6m, 6m to infinity, or full), selecting between auto and manual focus, and turning IS on or off. Unfortunately, these switches get hidden awkwardly under the tripod foot when you rotate it for shooting in portrait format. The Panasonic lens works better in this regard, as its control panel is located on its rotating collar. OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS: compared to Panasonic 100-400mm Here’s a size comparison between the OM System M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS and the Panasonic Leica DG Vario-Elmar 100-400mm f/4-6.3 Asph OIS. You can see just how much bulkier the OM System lens is, despite its two-thirds stop slower aperture at 100mm. In its retracted position, it’s 3.4cm longer and 3.4mm larger in diameter (note this doesn’t take into account the tripod shoe). The OM System/Olympus lens is also much heavier. On its own with no accessories it weighs 169g more (1120g vs 951g), but if you factor in the caps, hood and tripod mount, the difference in what you’ll actually be carrying around amounts to almost 300g (1405g vs 1114g). Each lens has its own pros and cons. The Panasonic has a low-profile tripod shoe that can be easily unscrewed when the lens is mounted on the camera, a zoom lock that can be engaged at any focal length, and a control panel that rotates to stay accessible when shooting on a tripod in portrait format. It also has a shallow sliding built-in hood, with a somewhat impractical clamp-on extension. The OM System/Olympus lens has a smoother zoom ring, a conventional hood (which incidentally also fits the firm’s 40-150mm f/2.8 zoom), and will attach directly to many tripod heads thanks to its Arca Swiss-compatible mount. OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS: Autofocus In terms of autofocus, the 100-400mm behaves much as we’d expect for a modern lens. With an internal-focus design powered by a stepper motor, AF is fast, silent and accurate, especially if you’re shooting static or slow-moving subjects. The key point to appreciate is that with such a long telephoto, depth of field is extremely limited, so it’s essential to position a fine focus point exactly where you need it, to ensure the subject is properly sharp. But even this can be challenging when working hand-held at full telephoto, as the IS can struggle to stabilise the viewfinder image sufficiently. When it comes to keeping focus on moving objects, you’ll likely be limited by the capability of your camera, which varies widely between Micro Four Thirds bodies. Using the phase detection-equipped Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III, I found the lens was perfectly capable of tracking focus on large, relatively predictably-moving subjects such as trains or planes, but struggled with smaller, more erratic wildlife. Here the slow maximum aperture clearly does it no favours compared to OM System’s 40-150mm f/2.8 and 300mm f/4 Pro-series telephotos. On the older, contrast detection-based E-M5 Mark II, I found it was only able to keep up with relatively slow-moving subjects, and the first frame in a burst was almost invariably out of focus. OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS: Performance Assessing the OM System 100-400mm for image quality can be a difficult task, because its performance is so intimately tied to the fact that long telezooms are most likely to be used outdoors to shoot moving subjects, such as wildlife, sports, or vehicles. This generally requires fast shutter speeds to combat
        motion blur, which coupled with the relatively small maximum aperture, means that you’ll often need to use high ISOs, even in bright sunlight. Lock the lens down on a tripod and point it at a brick wall using a low ISO, and you’ll find it’s capable of delivering impressively sharp images wide open. As tends to be the case with telezooms, it’s slightly weaker at 400mm than at 100mm, particularly towards the corners of the frame, where it benefits from being stopped down to f/8. Like all Micro Four Thirds lenses, pixel-level sharpness visibly deteriorates if you set the aperture much smaller than this, due to the inevitable onset of diffraction. Under controlled indoor tests I found the optical stabilisation worked pretty well, giving a good percentage of usable images at 1/25sec at 100mm, or 1/100sec at 400mm. This matches OM System’s claimed 3 stops, and wasn’t any better or worse than its Panasonic rival. But shooting outdoors can be a different proposition, particularly on a windy day that’s buffeting your lens as well as your subject. At full zoom, I often observed the IS really struggling to stabilise the viewfinder image. Once you start shooting real-world subjects, you’ll rapidly find that with its small aperture and demand for fast shutter speeds, this is an incredibly light-hungry lens. Even in bright sunlight, you’ll generally need to boost the ISO a couple of stops. When light levels drop lower, for example at dawn or dusk or on a cloudy day, you’ll quickly find yourself the wrong side of ISO 3200. This really isn’t Micro Four Thirds’ comfort zone, with noise and noise reduction robbing images of detail. When everything comes together, though, the lens is capable of delivering excellent results, particularly in good light and at relatively close range, where you can fill the frame with your subject without having to crop and aren’t affected by any atmospheric distortion. So it’s great for subjects such as garden birds, or as a pseudo-macro for shooting insects. But I was less happy with the images I got in even moderately low light, where the requirement for very high ISOs means that it’s difficult to capture much in the way of fine detail. How much this will matter to you depends on how you assess your files: if you demand sharp, noise-free results at 100% onscreen, forget about it. But if instead of pixel peeping you view the image as a whole, you might well be rather happier. OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS: Use with teleconverters Potentially one of the OM System’s/Olympus’ 100-400mm’s biggest selling points is its compatibility with the firm’s MC-14 and MC-20 teleconverters. These bring extraordinary telephoto reach, equivalent to 1100mm and 1600mm at full telephoto, respectively. The catch lies with the very small apertures: f/7.1-9 with the MC-14, and f/10-13 with the MC-20. But this doesn’t come with the same operational limitations that you’d get with DSLRs: the viewfinder image remains bright and clear, and autofocus still works remarkably well. In general, you’ll run out of sufficient light to get a decent image long before the AF fails. Instead, the key question is whether you can actually get any more detail using a teleconverter, compared to simply cropping and enlarging an image taken using the lens alone. The problem lies with diffraction: optical calculations suggest that theoretically, all you’re really doing is magnifying the Airy blur disc. At which point you’re just making life harder for yourself, for no clear gain. In practice it’s possible to get quite credible results with the MC-14, as long as you keep the aperture wide open and shoot in bright sunlight. However it’s pretty much essential to use a monopod to steady the lens, and preferably a tripod. But as predicted, close examination of the images reveals little in the way of really fine detail. Switching to the MC-20 is definitely a step too far. It does provide ludicrous reach, and at full zoom you can almost fill the frame with the moon. But the lens becomes extremely difficult to handle, and the tiny aperture means there’s precious little fine detail to be seen. As it turns out, ye cannae change the laws of physics.'

      value: Two years after it first started shipping, the OM System M.Zuiko Digital ED 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro has been in such great demand that it is still on back order. Wildlife and landscape photographer, Andrew Fusek Peters was lucky enough to enjoy its charms
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'OM System/Olympus 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro at a glance: When Olympus Cameras (now OM Digital Solutions) announced the development of a 150-400mm f/4.5 lens with a built-in switchable 1.25x teleconverter, many Micro Four Thirds wildlife shooters, myself included, had a hunch that it could be a game-changer. Here was a lens that would shoot the full-frame equivalent of 300-1000mm, at a constant f/4.5 aperture up to 800mm and then at f/5.6 with the 1.25x converter engaged. It also has an incredible 1.3 metre minimum focusing distance, allowing close-up pictures of dragonflies and butterflies. And to top it all, it would accept the OM System 1.4x and 2x teleconverters, meaning it could shoot at a mind-blowing 2000mm equivalent. For many years, I had shot with Canon. I loved the sharpness and autofocus but did not love the bulk and weight. Moving from the EOS 5D Mark IV and 500mm f/4 to the OM-D E-M1 Mark III (I now use the OM-1) and 300mm f/4 shrunk my kit bag hugely. My Canon set-up weighed a hefty 4.2kg, but the 150-400mm f/4.5 on its own is just 1.87kg so would come out at 2.5kg with the EM-1 Mark III or OM-1. That’s a serious weight saving. Furthermore, this is a zoom lens with a built-in teleconverter; the equivalent Canon EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x weighs 3.6kg alone and costs $11,100/£12,069, which compares with $7500/£6499 for this OM optic. My only minor concern was that this flagship lens might not perform to the very high standard of my other two OM System/Olympus Pro-series telephotos, the M.Zuiko Digital ED 40-150mm f/2.8 Pro and the M.Zuiko Digital ED 300mm f/4 IS Pro. Both are bitingly sharp but I had faith that this lens would follow in the same vein. OM System/Olympus 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro: Build and handling When the lens arrived in February, my worries proved unfounded. With a weight-saving carbon fibre reinforced plastic hood, magnesium alloy shell and sturdy tripod foot that was perfect for handholding, the lens that came out of the box felt solid but lightweight and extremely well engineered. Pairing it with my E-M1 Mark III and E-M1X (which required the latest firmware upgrade) revealed that this was a wildlife lens that could easily be carried all day, with no tripod necessary. In the hand it feels solid and easy to lift. Once it locks on, OM System’s IS is rock-solid even at distance. This is, however, a serious wildlife lens that requires good technique to use. But I had five years of using the Canon 500mm f/4 handheld and so did not have a problem cradling the lens in my left hand and operating the camera with my right hand. All of the controls feel logical and particularly the teleconverter, which can easily be operated with your right-hand fingers as you are focusing. The zoom is similarly smooth and quick, with the added bonus being that it is an internal zoom mechanism. In my first few months with the lens, I have crawled all over the Long Mynd and its light weight and small size has meant that I can get far closer to wildlife without alerting them to my presence. It’s 600g heavier than my OM System/Olympus 300mm f/4, but what you get is easily worth the weight gain. Fieldcraft has simply become easier with this lens, though I would recommend using a shoulder strap such as a BlackRapid if you are carrying it for an extended length of time. As you would expect with a lens of this calibre, there’s an array of buttons on the side. The only ones I used were the focus limiter, which was very useful to stop hunting if wildlife is nearer or further away, and the AF/MF switch when shooting from a tripod using Pro Capture, to nail the initial focus point. The preset button could be handy if you have a perch that a bird keeps coming back to and you need to hit that focus point instantly, while you can also program the four buttons around the lens barrel for preset focus points. For times when a tripod is a must, the tripod foot has an in-built Arca-Swiss mount. The internal zoom only requires a quarter turn across its full reach and in practice it’s fast to adjust. OM System/Olympus 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro: Autofocus There is a perception that Micro Four Thirds plays second string to full-frame in terms of AF and yes, the E-M1X’s bird AF is not as fast as Canon’s version on the EOS R5 (which was incredibly speedy when I tried it with the RF 600mm f/4). But I found the 150-400mm to be like the 300mm f/4 on steroids, being both quick and eager to lock on. I generally use a 5-point cross-shaped pattern for birds and animals and have captured some incredible moments. Combined with OM System’s Pro Capture mode, which can continually buffer up to 35 frames and then record them when you press the shutter button, bird and butterfly in-flight shots can become an everyday reality. But where it really excels is responding to unexpected situations like a hare popping up in a field, or a buzzard being mobbed by crows. There are plenty of times I have suddenly
        stopped my car and leaped out to try and capture what is occurring in front of my eyes. This is another area where size and weight make the difference. It does not feel like I am trying to slowly turn around a lumbering tank to aim at a target, as with a massive full-frame set-up. Size really does matter and the lens’s nimbleness is matched by superbly responsive AF. OM System/Olympus 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro: Performance None of the specs or the efforts OM System has made to bring this lens down in size and weight would matter if it did not deliver high-quality images. It did take me a couple of weeks to get used to the form factor and understand how the lens worked, but after that, I quickly stopped using my 300mm f/4, although I have kept my 40-150mm f/2.8 for butterflies. A fair few OM System shooters will pair this lens with the E-M1X, and it is a nicely balanced combo, but my main goal if I am out all day shooting is to carry the lightest rig possible and for this the OM-1 better suits my needs. Two things stand out in particular. Firstly, the extra reach. With one flick of a finger, the 1.25x converter is engaged and I suddenly have 1000mm equivalent reach handheld. Distant birds hidden in a tree can now become detailed portraits and a faraway bird in flight suddenly looks a lot nearer. Secondly, the zoom has saved my bacon several times when suddenly, there is wildlife much closer to me, or I am worried about clipping birds’ wings as they take off. My field of view can be adjusted quickly on the fly, an option that was obviously not available with the 300mm f/4. Of course, the proof of all this technological advancement is in the pudding. How do the raw files stack up in Lightroom? The answer is very pleasing. The images, when exposed properly, have great definition, contrast and detail. Surprisingly, going from f/4 on the 300mm to f/4.5 at 400mm gives me both extra reach and a tiny bit more depth of field, which is useful for birds in action. The weather-sealing has meant I have gone out in torrential rain and not worried about my set-up for a second. I do feel that OM Digital Solutions has built this lens to be as rugged and reliable as its counterparts and to deliver stellar performance, which it does in spades. The images have proved to be easily good enough for my media work in magazines and for the national papers. OM System/Olympus 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro: Summary The OM System/Olympus 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro really is a case of you get what you pay for. It’s an incredibly lightweight, blazingly fast-focusing, seriously sharp, highly engineered marvel of miniaturisation with an equivalent reach that ranges from 300mm all the way to 2000mm with a 2x teleconverter added. For stalking wildlife subjects it is both subtle and small and I am sure this would carry over to sports shooting. The quality of the results has been easily good enough for publication, as well as for my ongoing commission for the National Trust. This lens now stays on my OM-1 all the time making for an easy to pack and carry set-up, ideal for travelling. Using the OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 150-400mm f/4.5 TC1.25x IS Pro with teleconverters This lens is compatible with OM System’s/Olympus’ MC-14 1.4x and MC-20 2x teleconverters, priced at $350/£310 and $430/£399 respectively, which lead to a 1400mm equivalent lens at f/8 or a whopping 2000mm at f/11, still with full AF functionality. The converters are small, lightweight and genuinely useful. Indeed this level of reach is a game-changer: the 1.4x got me in close to a sitting hare, with the image quality nearly perfect. Put on the 2x and the results are surprisingly sharp, although diffraction will make a difference, as will heat haze over long distances. But I still managed to photograph a pair of barn owls from far enough away not to disturb them. Such reach can also be useful for extreme moon and sun shots, making them appear large in the frame and within the context of the landscape. I had never thought to aim for a man in the moon shot before, but this lens opens up new and extraordinary possibilities. You can still handhold at such extreme focal lengths, but a helpful fence post, or sitting down with the use of a knee as an improvised tripod, will give you more stabilisation. As ever with Olympus, the image stabilisation is absolutely fantastic, but at 2000mm things can get shaky. Affordable alternatives There is no getting round the fact that this is an expensive lens at $7500/£6500, although put up against full-frame equivalents like the Canon EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x which costs $11,100/£12,069, it’s a steal. But the OM System/Olympus has a more budget-friendly alternative, the M.Zuiko Digital ED 100-400mm f/5-6.3 IS which costs $1400/£1170. I borrowed a sample for the purposes of this article and given its price, it’s surprisingly sharp at both ends and can produce some fantastic images in good light. There is also the
        OM System/Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 300mm f/4 IS Pro at $2800/£2399, which was my go-to lens for three years. This is an amazing wildlife lens that takes the 1.4x and 2x teleconverters, and is both compact and lightweight.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The Sony FE 70-200mm F4 Macro G OSS II lens is a cheaper option than the F2.8 lens, saving you a substantial amount of money (£850 / $850), however, it’s also introduced at a considerably higher price than the previous version of the lens, being £750 / $750 more. For those that already have the previous version of this lens, there may not be enough reason to upgrade, (unless you want closer focus), but for those who don’t already own a 70-200mm lens, this could easily be the one lens you want.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Sony has updated the FE 70-200mm F4 G OSS lens with the new Sony FE 70-200mm F4 Macro OSS II version, which Joshua Waller is reviewing. Could this be one of the best Sony E-mount lenses available today? Let’s find out. It’s been 9 years since the original was released, and the new model is designed for improved image quality, closer focus, better AF performance, improved image stabilisation, as well as a smaller and lighter design. The new lens offers an impressive 0.5x macro over the entire zoom range, and it’s also compatible with teleconverters, giving up to 400mm (on full-frame cameras), as well as life-size macro performance, when using the 2x teleconverter. At a glance: As expected, the Sony lens uses the built-in optical distortion correction available on Sony E-mount cameras. This means that barrel and pincushion distortion, vignetting / shading, as well as chromatic aberration can be automatically corrected in camera. Sony say this lens gives improved corner sharpness, compared to the original, so let’s find out how this lens performs. If used on an APS-C camera, such as the new Sony Alpha A6700 , you’ll find you get a 105-300mm equivalent lens! Sony FE 70-200mm F4 Macro G OSS II Features The 70-200mm lens is made up of 19 elements in 13 groups, with 1x aspherical lens element, and 1x advanced aspherical (AA) lens, and these are used to minimise aberrations. There’s also 1x Super ED (extra-low dispersion) glass plus 3x ED (extra-low dispersion) glass elements used to reduced chromatic aberrations. The lens uses a floating focusing mechanism to give high resolution at all focus distances, and enables close focus. Optical image stabilisation, or OSS (Optical SteadyShot) as Sony call it, is included and should help with keeping your shots sharp when using longer telephoto zoom and slower shutter speeds. There’s a fluorine coating on the front of the lens designed to reduce flare and ghosting, as well as provide some protection against fingerprints and grease. Sony FE 70-200mm F4 Macro G OSS II Build and handling The lens is weather sealed and feels extremely well made, with high quality materials and construction. There’s a large rubber gripped focus ring at the front of the lens, as well as a larger rubber gripped zoom ring nearest to the camera body. All of the switches and buttons feel well built, and are re-assuringly solid when used. The lens fits snugly to the camera body, and we used the 33MP Sony Alpha A7 IV to test this lens. Thanks to the relatively light-weight of this lens, at 794g (without the tripod collar), the lens doesn’t feel too heavy, and when combined with the A7 IV, at 660g, gives a total weight of less than 1.5KG. As a premium lens option, the lens has an off-white colour finish, which can help keep the lens cooler when used in hot sunny climates. It also lets everyone know that you have the more premium option. The zoom ring is marked with 70, 100, 135, 200mm positions, and is lockable at 70mm. The zoom ring feels well-made and can be accessed even if you’re one of these photographers who uses your lens hood reversed. Switches on the side include: There’s no aperture ring on the lens, and if you’re looking for this, then the 70-200mm f2.8 OSS II would be a better option, albeit a more expensive option. There’s a removable tripod mount collar, which, when removed, brings the lens down to it’s advertised weight of just 794g (without lens caps). The tripod collar can be rotated, as expected, although there are no click stops, as you might find on some lenses, instead you are left to line up the dots yourself. A high-quality petal shaped lens hood is provided with the lens which will help shield the lens from stray light, and this can be reversed if needed. If you wanted extra reach, then you’ll find it supports the SEL14TC 1.4x teleconverter, plus the SEL20TC 2.0x teleconverter, giving 140-400mm on full-frame (with the later), or up to 600mm on APS-C. With the 2.0x teleconverter this gives 1x macro, and F8 aperture. Autofocus The lens features four XD (extreme dynamic) linear motors, two for each of the lens’ focus groups, for fast, precise autofocus and tracking, and Sony say this gives a 20% improved AF speed compared to the earlier version. It also supports blackout-free shooting at 30fps with the Sony Alpha A1. The lens’ focus system has been designed to suppress focus breathing optically, as well as supporting the digital correction available with some Sony cameras. Focus is rapid in use, and quiet in operation so it shouldn’t cause any issues when recording video. However, when fast moving subjects were very close to the lens, there were times when focus was missed. Direct manual focus (DMF) is available at all times, although this can be switched off if you don’t want this feature. Sony FE 70-200mm F4 Macro G OSS II Performance The lens gives excellent levels of sharpness throughout the zoom range, with exceptionally sharp detail captured, when shooting wide-open
        at F4. Sharpness levels continue throughout the frame, with only the slightest drop-off in sharpness towards the far corners. Images are also sharp and detail-rich when you’re focusing on subjects close to the lens. Looking at the JPEG images there is no distortion visible at either the wide-end of the lens or the telephoto end of the lens, as this is automatically corrected in-camera. However, when looking at the raw images with software that does not automatically apply correction, it’s possible to see pincushion distortion throughout the zoom range. In extreme cases it was possible to spot some chromatic aberrations in the form of purple fringing, however, this was very minor, and rarely seen in everyday images. There is very minimal vignetting (or darkened corners), although some could be noticed when shooting at 70mm at f4 when shooting plane scenes. Once stopped down this goes, and can very easily be corrected if needed, and isn’t noticeable as you zoom further through the zoom range. The lens offers an impressive level of flare control , and even when trying to take photos to show flare at its worst, the flare remained relatively small in the frame, and could be removed quite easily if needed. The lens creates 18 point sun-stars when stopped down, thanks to the 9 aperture blades. Bokeh is pleasing thanks to the circular aperture blades, but there are some “onion” rings in round orbs of light in the background of our macro shot. However, in the vast majority of shots this is not noticeable, with a pleasingly smooth background to be found. Value for money The Sony FE 70-200mm F4 Macro G OSS II lens is available for £1750. Looking at alternatives available from other brands, Nikon offer the Z 70-180mm F2.8 lens for £1299 (with VR), or the Z 70-200mm F2.8 VR S lens for £2399, whilst Canon offer an RF 70-200mm F4 lens for £1769. It appears as though Sony see the Canon lens as the competition, rather than the Nikon option. Nikon owners must be feeling particularly pleased with the choice of lower priced options.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Whilst it may not be quite long enough for photographing smaller birds, like Puffins, it does give enough reach for other birds and animals, depending on the distance. For smaller and more distant subjects, the 150-600mm lens may be needed, but these tend to cost more, and weigh more. If you’ already have a wide-angle zoom lens, such as a 24-70mm lens or similar, then the 50-400mm is a nice option, especially as a typical 100-400mm lens would leave a gap in the zoom range. The lens is also considerably lighter and smaller than the next step up in telephoto zooms, with both the Tamron 150-500mm and Sigma 150-600mm lenses weighing much more. If you could take just one lens with you, and wanted some telephoto reach, then this lens could be one of the most versatile, whilst also offering impressive image quality, so you don’t need to be worried that you’re making any kind of compromise on your photos.

      value: 'At a glance: With the Tamron 50-400mm F/4.5-6.3 Di III VC VXD we have a lens specifically designed for full-frame mirrorless cameras , and even more specifically Sony E-mount cameras . With a 50mm wide end, going to 400mm at the telephoto end, we get an 8x optical zoom ratio. Being designed specifically for mirrorless cameras, Tamron can use advanced lens design that factors in the built-in optical distortion correction available on Sony E-mount cameras. This means that barrel and pincushion distortion, vignetting / shading, as well as chromatic aberration can be corrected by the camera, and more creative optical construction can be used. Companies can focus on correcting optical issues that can’t be fixed in-camera when designing lenses, whilst not having to worry too much about the optical issues that can be corrected digitally, in-camera. If used on an APS-C camera, such as the Sony A6600 , you’ll find you get a 75-600mm equivalent lens! Tamron 50-400mm F/4.5-6.3 Di III VC VXD Features The Tamron 50-400mm lens is made up of 24 elements in 18 groups, making this a relatively complex lens design. The lens uses XLD (eXtra Low Dispersion), LD (Low Dispersion) and composite / Hybrid Aspherical lens elements in order to reduce aberrations such as axial chromatic aberration, and as mentioned above, these are designed to correct in-lens what can’t be easily corrected in software, whilst maintaining as high a resolution image as possible. Tamron’s BBAR G2 coating is applied, and it’s nice to see Tamron continuing this tradition of their “Broad Band Anti-Reflection” coating. Whilst the BBAR branding harks back to much earlier lenses, the G2 version has been used since 2019, and is designed to reduce ghosting and flare. Handling and design Tamron lenses have long been functional rather than stylish, but for a while now, Tamron’s new design language has meant that they look a little bit more stylish and premium than they used to. The same can be said for this telephoto zoom lens, although, it’s very rare for a telephoto zoom lens to look anything other than functional. Scratch and fingerprint resistance is said to be improved thanks to an improved paint finish. Towards the front of the lens is the zoom control, which goes from 50mm to 400mm, with common steps marked in-between, including 70mm, 100mm, 135mm, 200mm, 300mm, and 400mm. To go from 50mm to 400mm requires just a 75 degree turn of the ring, and this works smoothly with it possible to set the zoom with some accuracy. Behind this are a range of switches including VC mode (1,2, and off), as well as a custom switch with three positions, and a focus set button. Next is the manual focus ring, which has a pleasing rubber grip. For those looking for a lens tripod mount, you can buy the A035TM, which is sold separately, and supports Arca-Swiss compatible tripod mounts. The 67mm filter thread is common on a number of Tamron lenses, including the 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD, making it easier to switch filters between lenses. A built-in USB Type-C connection allows for firmware updates, as well as customisation of functions when connected to a computer running ‘Tamron Lens Utility’ with an optional USB cable. A firmware update was released in December 2022 to improve AF performance, and you can use the software to customise options such as ‘Focus Limiter Function’. Auto-focus There’s a linear motor focus mechanism called ‘VXD’, which Tamron claim gives the ‘highest level of speed and accuracy in its class.’ I found the focus to be rapid, and more important for me, it was very accurate, with consistently reliable focus. Half macro focus is possible at 50-70mm zoom, with a 25cm minimum object distance (MOD) at 50mm and 27cm MOD at 70mm. At the telephoto end offers a 1:4 ratio, with a minimum object distance of 1.5m (150cm). In practice, whilst you may not necessarily want to use this as a dedicated macro lens, this ability does allow for closer focus and less worry about being too close to the subject. Tamron 50-400mm F/4.5-6.3 Di III VC VXD Performance The lens performs well from 50mm with an impressive level of sharpness, even when using apertures that are nearly fully wide-open such as f/5.6. There’s plenty of detail as you zoom further, with good levels of sharpness at 400mm. This means you can shoot at the brighter aperture settings and get sharp detailed images, with sharpness increasing across the frame as you stop down slightly. As mentioned previously distortion is very well controlled with in-camera lens compensation switched on, and this is also automatically applied to raw files as well as JPEGs. This means you don’t need to worry about barrel or pincushion distortion when using this lens. However, if you do switch off correction, the distortion is relatively minimal, and will be most visible when shooting images with lots of straight edges. With in-camera chromatic aberration correction switched on, fringing is nowhere to be found. Even when examining
        the raw files, with this switched off, I struggled to find any strong examples of fringing. Vignetting is visible when shooting wide-open at the telephoto end of the lens, when looking at the JPEG images from the camera, but when opening the raw files in Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) this is automatically corrected. Shooting into bright light sources isn’t a cause for concern for this lens, as it was difficult to spot any images with lens flare. As an added bonus, the provided lens hood helps keep stray light off the front lens element. Background blur, and bokeh is handled nicely although your results may vary depending on, of course, how far away the background is, and what’s in the background. Some of our shots looked a little busy, but others looked quite pleasing. If bokeh is an aim of yours, then a brighter lens is likely to give you more pleasing results. Value for money There are a range of similar telephoto zoom lenses available, but none offer the same range as the Tamron. As a reference, here are some similar lenses, including the current price, and weight of the lens:'

      value: Andy Westlake tests a large aperture zoom for Sony full-frame cameras with an unusual focal-length range in our Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD review
    - type: conclusion
      value: 'But ultimately, this is a lens that will stand or fall by its unusual focal-length range, particularly when compared to more conventional ultra-wide zooms. It’s sure to be popular with vloggers, with 20mm being a convenient focal length for arm’s length self-recording, and the f/2.8 aperture providing a degree of background blur. But it could also be attractive to stills photographers shooting subjects such as landscapes, architecture, or travel. Ultimately, whether the 20-40mm f/2.8 is a better option than more conventional wide zooms such as the firm’s 17-28mm f/2.8 alternative will come down purely to personal preference for each user. But it’s great to see Tamron providing the choice. Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD: Full specifications'
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'On the whole, lenses tend to fit into a few well-defined categories: wideangle zoom, standard zoom, and so on. But the Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD is a little different. Designed for Sony full-frame mirrorless cameras, it’s one of a recent spate of lenses that start at 20mm – wider than most standard zooms, but somewhat narrower than conventional wide zooms – and then extend into ‘standard’ territory. However in contrast to the Panasonic Lumix S 20-60mm F3.5-5.6 and the Sony FE 20-70mm F4 G , this lens provides a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture, albeit with a short 2x zoom range. It really is one of a kind, but is this enough to make it one of the best lenses for Sony E-mount? Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD at a glance: These unique specs do beg the question of who, and what, the lens is for ? Photographers adding a wideangle zoom to their existing kit will likely be tempted to get something wider, such as Tamron’s own 17-28mm F/2.8 Di III RXD or the Sigma 16-28mm F2.8 DG DN (both of which we like a lot). But the clue comes from Tamron’s preferred designation of the 20-40mm as a standard lens . For certain purposes, such as landscape and travel photography or vlogging , that unusual wide-to-standard range means some users might keep it on their cameras most of the time. Other key attractions of the Tamron 20-40mm f/2.8 lie with portability and affordability . It’s one of the smallest Sony E-mount full-frame zooms you can buy; only the Sony FE 28-60mm F4-5.6 kit zoom is both smaller and lighter. Even the Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G is larger, although fractionally lighter. At $699 / £879, it’s also keenly priced. So how does it perform? Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD: Features Tamron has built the 20-40mm using 12 optical elements in 11 groups , including four LD (Low Dispersion) glass elements, two GM (Glass Molded Aspherical) lenses, and one hybrid aspherical lens. As usual, the aim is to maintain fine detail rendition all the way across the frame while minimising chromatic aberration. The firm’s latest Broad Band Anti-Reflection  (BBAR) G2 multi-coating is applied to suppress flare and ghosting. Focusing is handled by a VXD linear motor which promises silent, responsive operation. With a minimum focus distance of 19cm at wideangle, stretching to 29cm at the 40mm position, the lens should be capable of producing striking wide-angle close-ups. The aperture diaphragm is formed of nine curved blades, with the aim of rendering attractively blurred backgrounds. One welcome feature is moisture resistant construction , with an array of seals around the barrel providing peace of mind when shooting outdoors in wet weather. Filter users will find a 67mm attachment thread, which is surrounded by a bayonet attachment for the supplied lens hood. Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD: Lens Utility software Like Tamron’s other recent E-mount optics, the 20-40mm f/2.8 includes a built-in USB-C port . This allows customisation of the focus ring’s operation via the Tamron Lens Utility software, which is available for both Windows and Mac PCs, and Android smartphones. You can reverse the manual focus ring’s direction of operation and switch it between non-linear and linear operation, with a choice of rotation angles from minimum focus to infinity (90°, 180°, 270° or 360°). It’s also possible to update the lens’s firmware without needing an external dock. It’s a really useful approach that I’d love to see in more lenses. Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD: Build and Handling For a full-frame f/2.8 zoom, the Tamron 20-40mm f/2.8 is strikingly compact . Measuring 86.5mm in length, 74.4mm in diameter, and just 365g in weight, it’s an agreeable option for carrying around all day. I mainly paired it with the Sony Alpha A7R IV and found it to be a nicely balanced combination. Its petite size is also advantageous either for use with a gimbal, or for arm’s length vlogging. The lens is at its shortest at the 40mm setting, and extends slightly on zooming out to 20mm. While this light weight comes courtesy of predominantly plastic skinned construction, that doesn’t mean the lens feels cheaply made. Both the zoom and focus rings turn smoothly and precisely. The former is perfectly placed in the centre of the barrel, which means it falls naturally to hand when you’re shooting. About the only handling quirk is that the lens can require a little more effort than usual to mount it onto the camera, which presumably is due to the seal around the mount being slightly chunkier than usual. But this doesn’t seem to result in any ill effects. Some users may be disconcerted by the fact that the USB-C port has no cover. But it’s worth bearing in mind this is also the case on most smartphones, many of which are protected against full immersion in water for extended periods of time. I wouldn’t worry about it. Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD: Autofocus When it comes to autofocus , the lens goes about its business silently and reasonably quickly. For
        shooting stills of static subjects in AF-S mode, it’ll acquire focus rapidly and accurately. Switch to continuous AF, and it’ll continue to do a reasonable job of keeping up with objects that are moving towards, or away from, the camera. However, it’s not fast enough at refocusing to achieve a 100% hit rate during high-speed bursts of erratically moving subjects, especially at close distances. But I doubt this will be a major concern for most users. Switch to video , and the story regarding AF is much the same. Autofocus is completely silent, so won’t impinge on your soundtrack at all. The lens pulls focus between subjects smoothly and accurately, but it won’t necessarily keep track of fast movement as well as a Sony lens might. Focus breathing is generally well suppressed, and can only really be detectable when making large focus shifts at small apertures, with the angle of view narrowing fractionally at closer distances. But it’s unlikely to be objectionable in normal use. Engage manual focus mode, and you’ll find the lens is equally well behaved. Turning the focus ring brings up a basic distance scale in the camera’s viewfinder, and you can also set it to activate magnified view if you prefer. I appreciated the option of switching the lens focus ring to linear mode via the Tamron Lens Utility app, as I find it more intuitive (I used the 180° focus throw option). Tamron 20-40mm F/2.8 Di III VXD: Performance When it comes to image quality , the Tamron 20-40mm f/2.8 puts in a very respectable showing. I tested it on the 61MP Sony Alpha A7R IV , which represents the most demanding full-frame sensor currently available in terms or resolution, and I was generally pleased by the results. It delivers images that look impressively detailed when viewed full-screen on my 24-in monitor, which is broadly representative of an A3+ (13 x 19in) print. What’s more, there’s plenty of finer detail visible when examining images at 100% onscreen. Overall, the lens behaves very much as expected for a modern mirrorless zoom in terms of sharpness . Even at f/2.8, it’s pixel-level sharp in the centre of the frame throughout the focal-length range. Naturally detail in the corners isn’t as crisp, but the level of blurring is never objectionably high. As usual on full-frame cameras, you’ll get the sharpest results overall around f/8, with diffraction inducing increasing blur at smaller apertures. But this may well count as an acceptable trade-off for increased depth of field. Tamron takes full advantage of the in-camera lens compensation settings available in Sony Alpha bodies, which means you’ll get the cleanest and best-corrected results if you leave them enabled. But even if you switch them all off for some reason, the lens still delivers quite acceptable results. There’s visible barrel distortion at 20mm and pincushion distortion at 40mm, with a neutral point around the 28mm mark, but it’s not huge. Much the same can be said about lateral chromatic aberration – a little colour fringing can be visible around high-contrast edges in the corners of the frame if you go looking for it, but it’s really not problematic. It’s also automatically corrected in raw processing by Adobe software. As for vignetting , this is quite strong at 20mm and f/2.8, giving marked darkening corner in the corners with evenly toned subjects. But it decreases substantially on stopping down to f/4 and goes away almost completely at f/5.6. Zoom to the middle or long end of the range, and you’ll just see a little fall-off at f/2.8, which pretty much disappears by f/4. Enable in-camera compensation, and the vignetting is suppressed in both raw and JPEG files. The lens is also well-behaved when shooting into the light . I saw no problematic loss of contrast even when pointing the camera directly into a low sun, and then bringing up shadow detail in raw processing. Stop down to f/11 or smaller, and it’s possible to induce well-defined sun stars, if that’s your thing. With its large maximum aperture, you can also get some nicely blurred backgrounds shooting close-ups, especially at the 40mm end. Sharpness stays decently high, but bokeh isn’t super-smooth, with bright-ring outlines to background blur circles. But this can still give interesting painterly effects.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: With the 12-45mm f/4, Olympus has made a stunning small, lightweight standard zoom that’s a more affordable, but equally fine alternative to the 12-40mm f/2.8 and 12-40mm f/2.8 II. It provides a rare combination of ruggedness, portability, and superb image quality, particularly when used in combination with the OM-D E-M5 Mark III. Its remarkable macro capability is the icing on the cake, bringing an extra layer of creativity. There’s a lot of focus right now on the image quality advantages of larger sensors, but let’s not forget that lenses are an equally important part of the equation, and it’s easier to make top-notch optics for smaller sensors. As a result, you’ll struggle to find another lens quite like this for any other system. Probably the lens’s biggest limitation is its f/4 maximum aperture, which affords precious little scope for selective focus effects or manipulating depth of field. If this is important to you, the 12-40mm f/2.8 would be the better choice. Equally for Olympus users who already own and are happy with a 12-40mm f/2.8 or 12-40mm f/2.8 II, there’s no obvious reason to change. However for Micro Four Thirds users who’d like to upgrade their kit lens without adding much bulk, or indeed DSLR users looking to downsize their kit, the 12-45mm f/4 is definitely one to shortlist.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'When mirrorless cameras first appeared, one of their main attractions was supposed to be decreased size and weight. Indeed Olympus and Panasonic’s original joint press release announcing the birth of Micro Four Thirds, the world’s first mirrorless system, declared that it would enable users to ‘take advantage of significantly more compact lenses, particularly in the wide-angle and high-power zoom range’. As things have progressed, though, this goal often seems to have been lost by the wayside, to the extent that while the latest full-frame mirrorless cameras may be smaller than their DSLR counterparts, their lens systems have generally become larger. Reduced size and weight is still a key benefit of smaller-sensor cameras, however, and Olympus/OM Digital Solutions seems to be particularly intent on maximizing this advantage. The M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-45mm f/4 Pro came out in February 2020 and at the time of launch, the firm claimed it was the world’s smallest and lightest zoom lens with a constant maximum aperture. It’s designed to provide users with premium optics and tough, weather-sealed build quality in a tiny package that’s just 7cm long and weighs 254g. With a versatile zoom range equivalent to 24-90mm in full-frame terms, it looks like an ideal complement to the E-M5 III or the more recent OM System OM-5 although the $500 / £599 price tag could be a tough sell for a lens this small. Olympus 12-45mm f/4 Pro: Features Olympus says that the 12-45mm f/4 employs an optical formula based in its existing M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm F2.8 Pro (replaced by the M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-40mm F2.8 Pro II with uprated weathersealing in February 2022) which is an enticing prospect given that this one of the finest standard zooms available. Detailed examination shows that the new lens’s 12-element, 9-group formula is indeed very closely related to its sibling’s 14-element, 9-group design. It makes similarly lavish use of special glass, too, incorporating aspheric, dual super-aspheric (DSA), high refractive index (HR), super-high refractive index and Extra-low Dispersion (ED) elements into its construction, in order to minimise optical aberrations. Meanwhile Olympus’s Zero coating is applied to suppress flare and ghosting. It’s difficult to think of another small zoom with a similarly ambitious design. As part of the premium Pro series, the 12-45mm F4 is also designed to be dust-, splash- and freeze-proof, with a range of seals protecting vulnerable points such as the front element, manual-focus and zoom rings, and mount. One feature it gives up relative to the firm’s other Pro zooms, though, is the push-pull focus clutch; instead it employs a simple, continuously rotating electronic manual focus ring. This drives a single focusing element that’s placed towards the rear of the lens, which also affords rapid, silent autofocus. The aperture diaphragm employs seven curved blades in a bid to provide attractive background blur. However with the f/4 maximum aperture giving equivalent depth-of-field characteristics to f/5.6 on APS-C and f/8 on full-frame, you won’t see a huge degree of blur, except during close-up shooting. But here the lens has another trick: its minimum focus distance ranges from 12cm at wideangle to 23cm at telephoto, maintaining an impressive 0.5x equivalent magnification across the entire zoom range. It’s also compatible with the focus bracketing and stacking functions built into Olympus’s recent models, which allow depth of field to be extended without sacrificing background blur. In the box you’ll find a simple bayonet-fit plastic lens hood, which reverses neatly over the barrel for storage, but lacks any locking mechanism to hold it in place. The accessory thread measures just 58mm, which enables the use of relatively inexpensive filters. Olympus 12-45mm f/4 Pro: Build and Handling In terms of design, the 12-45mm f/4 is immediately recognisable as a Pro-series optic. It employs a familiar-looking all-metal barrel, with finely ridged grips to the focus and zoom and focus rings. The latter falls naturally to your fingers, and both operate super-smoothly. But there’s no space for a customisable L.Fn button on the lens’s barrel. With its compact size and light weight, the 12-45mm is a perfect complement to Olympus’s smaller cameras such as the E-M10 and E-M5 series. Its Micro Four Thirds mount means it’ll also fit onto Panasonic cameras, and should work very nicely with the likes of the G80, G90 and GX9. But as it doesn’t include optical stabilisation, it’s not such a great match to older or smaller bodies that aren’t equipped with in-body stabilisation. Olympus zooms compared When the original OM-D E-M5 appeared in 2012, its kit zoom was the M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-50mm f/3.5-6.3 EZ. This lightweight, versatile, weather-sealed optic featured an unusual switchable manual/electronic zoom and a dedicated macro setting, but it was optically mediocre. Thankfully Olympus users didn’t have to wait too long
        for the stellar 12-40mm f/2.8, which became the natural fit to the E-M5 Mark II. But while not exactly large, it’s almost twice the weight of the 12-50mm. The 12-45mm essentially offers a similar concept to the 12-50mm, but with vastly better optics. Paired with the E-M5 Mark III or the OM-5, the combination weighs just 668g, a reduction of over 20% compared to the E-M5 Mark II with the 12-40mm, and just 32g heavier than the original E-M5 with the 12-50mm. The 12-45mm is also the shortest of the three by 13mm, making it the easiest to pack into a small bag. For more options have a look at the best Micro Four Thirds lenses . Olympus 12-45mm f/4 Pro: Autofocus Turning our attention to focusing, it quickly becomes apparent that the 12-45mm f/4 is pretty much beyond reproach. Tested with a range of cameras from both Olympus and Panasonic, it snaps into focus instantly and silently, with all the accuracy that you’d expect from on-sensor AF. It’s especially impressive on the phase-detection equipped E-M5 Mark III. Manual focus offers an excellent experience, too. Rotating the focus ring can automatically engage your preferred focus aid, such as peaking or magnified view, and its smooth action makes precise focusing a breeze. As a result, I never really missed having a manual focus clutch. Olympus 12-45mm f/4 Pro: Performance Given its close relationship to the 12-40mm f/2.8 and 12-40mm f/2.8 II, I had high expectations for the 12-45mm f/4. Thankfully, it doesn’t disappoint. The coronavirus pandemic prevented us from doing our usual studio-based tests, so this review is based on detailed examination of a wide range of images, from both controlled tests and real-world shooting. This reveals that the 12-45mm hasn’t just inherited its larger-aperture sibling’s looks and optics, but also its stellar image quality. In essence, it delivers near-flawless results no matter what you ask of it. Tested on the 20MP E-M5 Mark III, the lens provides excellent sharpness from corner to corner. It gives near-indistinguishable results to the original 12-40mm f/2.8 when comparing images shot side-by-side under controlled conditions, with the only discernable difference being that the 12-45mm suffers from just a little softening in the corners at 12mm f/4. But this is only visible when pixel peeping images at 100% on a computer screen, and shouldn’t be a problem in print. Overall, I’d happily shoot at any focal length and subject distance, and all apertures from f/4 down to about f/11. But I’d caution against stopping down further, as this always results in excessive diffraction softening on Micro Four Thirds. There’s little to worry about with regards to vignetting, and while some corner darkening can be discernible when shooting evenly toned subjects at 12mm and f/4, it’s not objectionable. Software correction of distortion and lateral chromatic aberration is integrated into Micro Four Thirds, and as a result, you’ll rarely see any colour fringing or bowing of straight lines along the edges of the frame. The only exception is when shooting close-ups at the wide end of the zoom, when some barrel distortion becomes apparent. But if you need such images to be geometrically accurate, simply back off from the subject and zoom in. Close-up shooting is of course this lens’s party trick, and one at which it excels. Its impressive minimum focus distance across the entire zoom allows a wide range of creative looks, from expansive backgrounds at wideangle to tighter framing at telephoto. The main practical limitation arises at wideangle, where the working distance to the subject is just a few millimetres from the front element, which makes it difficult to avoid getting in your own light. But again, image quality is really good, and if you shoot wide open at 45mm, it’s also possible to get some very attractive-looking background blur. About the only point of concern is flare when shooting directly into the sun, which can result in loss of contrast and red internal reflection patterns. But you can see this live in the viewfinder when you’re shooting, which can help you to suppress it by such means as tweaking the composition or stopping down the aperture.'

      value: With the M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm f/4 IS Pro, Olympus has made probably the best superzoom lens on the planet, says Andy Westlake
    - type: conclusion
      value: I’ve always liked the idea of superzoom lenses; I tend to shoot quite a lot at both wideangle and telephoto, and it’s great to be able to do so without swapping lenses all the time. But previously, I haven’t found one that quite makes the grade with respect to image quality. However Olympus has changed all that with the 12-100mm f/4 IS Pro. I was really impressed when I first used it while reviewing the E-M1 Mark II, and several years on camera I still can’t believe how good it is. Quite simply, this lens brings an unparalleled combination of high image quality, compositional versatility, robust construction and near-magical image stabilisation. It’s not one to choose for shallow depth of field, but if you want to shoot a wide range of subjects without changing lenses, from sweeping landscapes to close-ups, it can do all of these with remarkable ease. It’s an outdoor photographer’s dream. Of course, many buyers will balk at the idea of paying a four-figure sum for a superzoom. But this one really can do it all unexpectedly well, and potentially replace a two or three other lenses in your bag. It’s a great addition to any Micro Four Thirds shooter’s arsenal. For more options have a look at our guide to the best Micro Four Thirds lenses
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm f/4 IS Pro is an optically-stabilised 8.3x superzoom lens for Micro Four Thirds cameras, offering a 24-200mm equivalent range. It costs around $1,200 / £1,200. If you’ve been interested in cameras and lenses for any length of time, chances are you’ll have picked up some useful guides as to what kind of kit gives the best image quality. It’s widely understood that cameras with larger format sensors should give better results than those with than smaller ones, and that fixed focal-length prime lenses are sharper than zooms. When we compare zooms, those with relatively short 3x ranges are best, outperforming those that cover a wider range of focal lengths. All-in-one ‘superzoom’ lenses with zoom ratios of 7x or greater are really all about convenience, requiring considerable optical compromises to achieve their extended range. So what to make of Olympus’s 12-100mm f/4 lens, that was launched alongside the firm’s flagship OM-D E-M1 Mark II at the end of 2016? It’s an 8.3x superzoom for Micro Four Thirds cameras, which have sensors somewhat smaller than the common APS-C format found in most enthusiast DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. Surely this must be a marriage made in hell, at least in terms of image quality? Well, sometimes it turns out that what we think we know is wrong. The giveaway that things might be different here comes in the lens’s name, not to mention its price. The ‘Pro’ designation means that it’s in Olympus’s top line, with weather-sealed construction and premium optics. Meanwhile the $1,200 / £1,200 price tag indicates that the firm hasn’t skimped in solving the problems posed by such an ambitious design. To cut a long story short, the result is the probably the best superzoom ever made. Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm f/4 IS Pro Features As all-in-one zooms go, the 12-100mm is unusual in many respects. It’s one of just a handful of such lenses starting at a 24mm equivalent wideangle, compared to the more usual 28mm; in return, it extends rather less far at telephoto. The closest comparable optics are the Sony FE 24-240mm f/3.5-6.3 OSS at $,1050 / £720, Canon’s RF 24-240mm f/4-6.3 IS USM at $799 / £959 and Nikon’s Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR at $799 / £769. For more options have a look at the best Micro Four Thirds lenses . An indication of just how unusual the 12-100mm is lies in its optical formula, which comprises 17 elements in 11 groups. But this includes no fewer than 12 special elements to maximise image quality: three aspheric elements; one dual-sided aspheric (DSA); one element made of high refractive-index (HR) glass and two of Super HR glass; and five of extra-low dispersion glass. Olympus has also employed its Z Coating Nano to reduce flare and ghosting. Close-up capability is impressive, with the lens boasting a minimum focus of just 15cm at wideangle, which turns out to be a matter of millimetres away from the front element. Perhaps more practically, it’s still capable of focusing on an image area of around 82mm x 62mm when set to the 100mm position, giving a magnification equivalent to 0.42x on full-frame. A petal-type lens hood is included in the box, with a locking button to hold it in place, and the lens accepts 72mm filters. The really big deal, though, is the addition of optical image stabilisation. This was Olympus’s second lens to include this feature, after its M.Zuiko Digital ED 300mm f/4 IS Pro telephoto; previously the firm has relied solely on in-body stabilisation. It makes the 12-100mm an attractive option not just to Olympus users, but also to owners of older Panasonic cameras that don’t include in-body stabilisation Crucially, though, the 12-100mm is compatible with Olympus’s Sync IS, in which the lens’s optical stabilisation and the in-body sensor-shift stabilisation work together for increased overall effect. As a result, when used on the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, the system is rated to provide 6.5 stops of stabilisation, and when it’s mounted on the OM System OM-1 the stabilisation is boosted to up to 7.5EV. With older OM-D and PEN cameras, however, the stabilisation won’t be quite so marked. Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm f/4 IS Pro Build and Handling The 12-100mm is built to essentially the same pattern as Olympus’s other top-end Pro lenses, with a tough metal barrel that’s sealed against dust and moisture. Cosmetically it’s somewhat fussier than the current fashion for streamlined, minimalist design typified by the likes of Zeiss, with finely textured zoom and focus rings, and accented rings around the barrel in gunmetal and blue. A couple of ridged barrel sections next to the mount provide extra grip for mounting and removing the lens. At 77.5mm in diameter, 116.5 long and 561g in weight, this is one of the largest lenses in the Micro Four Thirds system, surpassed only by a few premium telephotos. It’s a good fit to high-end bodies such as the E-M1 Mark II, E-M1 Mark III, OM-1 or Panasonic G9, but on smaller cameras
        it can feel somewhat front-heavy, if not excessively unwieldy. On my E-M5 Mark II, I prefer to use it with the add-on ECG-2 handgrip. The centrally-positioned zoom ring falls perfectly to hand, and rotates smoothly through approximately 90 degrees from one end of the range to the other. In front of it is the dual-mode manual-focus ring; more on this later. One the side of the barrel is perhaps the largest, easiest-to-use image stabilisation switch I’ve seen; potentially confusingly, this controls both the in-lens and in-body IS systems simultaneously, so setting it to Off disables both. Below it a customisable L.Fn button, which by default interrupts autofocus but can be reconfigured from the camera’s menus to operate other functions such as depth-of-field preview. There’s no zoom lock switch, but that’s not a problem, as the lens simply doesn’t need one. Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm f/4 IS Pro Autofocus When it comes to autofocus, the 12-100mm is extremely capable. With static subjects, it focuses quickly, accurately and silently, regardless of the focus distance, or where in the frame you choose to place the subject. Likewise with continuous autofocus, I found the lens to be capable of keeping up with whatever the E-M1 Mark II asked of it during my testing, quite happily holding focus on moving subjects at 10fps or faster. For manual focusing, the lens is equally well behaved. Like Olympus’s other Pro lenses, pulling the focus ring back towards the camera enters manual focus mode, revealing a distance scale that’s marked in feet and meters, and with hard end stops to its travel. Alternatively if you switch the camera body to MF mode, the focus ring can operate in a conventional focus-by-wire mode, which I found to offer finer adjustment of focus should you need it. The lens behaves as though it’s parfocal, in other words the focus distance doesn’t change as you zoom; close observation reveals that this is achieved by the lens automatically adjusting the position of the focus group. Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm f/4 IS Pro Performance So how does the lens perform in real world use? This is where things get interesting, because the 12-100mm F4 IS gives unusually fine image quality for a long-range zoom. Coupled with its implausibly effective image stabilisation, this turns it into a unique, and really useful photographic tool. Optically, it’s exceptionally well behaved. It’s impressively sharp across the frame at all focal lengths, with just a little smearing in the extreme corners at the wideangle setting. It’s pretty much at its sharpest wide open, but I’d avoid using apertures much smaller than f/8 due to diffraction softening. Impressively, it’s pretty much as sharp at its minimum focus distance as it is for more distant subjects. As usual with Micro Four Thirds, chromatic aberration and distortion are both automatically corrected in software, and as a result you won’t see much hint of either in normal use.. Vignetting is too low to be of any practical consequence. With its f/4 maximum aperture, this lens isn’t going to be your first choice for shooting with shallow depth of field: it’ll give similar results to using f/5.6 on APS-C, or f/8 on full-frame in this respect. But you can still get some attractively blurred backgrounds, particularly when shooting close-ups and towards the long end of the zoom. It’s the image stabilisation, though, sets the 12-100mm apart, at least when used on current Olympus bodies. With other IS systems I wouldn’t usually expect to get sharp images at shutter speeds longer than 0.5 seconds; with this one I’ve shot hand-held at speeds as long as 4 seconds and got perfectly usable results. This does demand optimum shooting conditions and good technique, including holding the camera to your eye rather than composing with the LCD, but incredibly, it really works. Crucially it means that when shooting static subjects in low light, you can continue to use low ISOs where you’d have to raise the sensitivity considerably on other cameras. This in turn means that despite the camera’s smaller sensor, you can get at least as good, or better overall image quality. Resolution Like most superzooms the 12-100mm is sharpest in the image centre at wideangle, as confirmed by our Applied Imaging MTF50 tests. It gets progressively softer as you zoom in, but not to a troublesome degree. It’s also much sharper in the corners than lesser-quality high-ratio zooms, especially at longer focal lengths. In general, best results are obtained at f/4-5.6. Shading Smaller sensor formats usually suffer less from vignetting, and that’s exactly what we get here. At first sight things might look bad, with a precipitous drop-off into the corners, but it’s the numbers that matter and at less than 0.7 stops, vignetting is barely visible in real-world use. Closing the aperture down a stop eliminates the effect, too. Curvilinear Distortion With software correction automatically applied at every stage
        in Micro Four Thirds, the vast majority of users won’t see all that much evidence of distortion at all. If you go out of your way to break the system, you can find an underlying distortion pattern of barrel-type at wideangle, and pincushion at telephoto. But it’s really only of academic interest.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: From my time using the Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS, I’d have to conclude that it’s the best-judged general-purpose zoom Sony has yet made. Impressively sharp, not too bulky, weather-resistant and with a really useful zoom range, it ticks all the right boxes. I can’t imagine anyone being disappointed with it. Indeed for those buying into the full-frame Alpha system anew, I’d say this 24-105mm is just as good a choice as the $1598 / £1669 FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM, depending on your preferences. Obviously some photographers will prefer the brighter aperture, but I’d rather take the longer range and smaller size – not to mention the lower price. Meanwhile for existing users who shoot with the FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS it’s an upgrade well worth considering, especially if you often find yourself coming up against the limits of the zoom range. It’s not as affordable or petite, but its extra telephoto range is oh-so-useful, while the addition of an AF hold button along with focus and IS mode switches are great for usability. Overall it’s just a really versatile lens that gives consistently excellent results.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS Review At a glance: The Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS was announced in late 2017 so it is one of the earliest lenses for the Sony Alpha full frame camera range but it’s an evergreen optic that still feels fresh and responsive today. It combines an extended 24-105mm zoom range with a constant f/4 maximum aperture, built-in optical stabilization, should you need it, with very good optical performance right across the range. It’s certainly a cheaper and more versatile alternative than the costly Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master and its successor, the even more expensive FE 24-70mm f/2.8 G Master II , and of a higher quality than the basic Sony FE 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS often sold as an affordable kit lens. The Sony Vario-Tessar T* FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS is another good alternative, but no faster than the FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS and with a shorter zoom range, while the retracting Sony FE 28-60mm f/4-5.6 is designed solely for size, not versatility and is not really a rival. There are third-party standard zoom alternatives, such as the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 Di III VXD G2 , the Sigma 28-70mm f/2.8 DG DN Contemporary and the Samyang 24-70mm f/2.8 AF, and Sony itself has an interesting contender in the form of the Sony FE 20-70mm f/4 G , for those who prefer a wider view. However, for anyone who wants a classic 24-105mm lens for their Sony Alpha body, the FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS is still the only game in town – and it’s a good one. If you want a longer zoom range, the only option from the Sony range is the FE 24-240mm f/3.5-6.3 OSS , which like most extended-range superzooms is somewhat compromised optically and has a variable maximum aperture. To find out more, see our guide to the best Sony E-mount lenses and also the best Sony cameras today. When Sony’s full-frame Alpha 7 mirrorless cameras first appeared, there were legitimate concerns about the limited lens range available, and how quickly Sony might be able to build up a comprehensive system. But over the past few years the firm has accelerated the release of new optics and with plenty of third-party support, the choice of lenses is second to none in the full frame camera market. The FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS sits among three Sony 24-70mm options in terms of size and price. With a current street price of around  $1200 / £1000, it’s not cheap, but it’s not ruinously expensive either. It’s often offered as a kit lens bundle with Sony bodies, but rarely with any significant discount, which is perhaps an indication of its quality. Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS features This lens sits within Sony’s high-end G line-up, but below its G Master series – though Sony’s ‘G’ optics often delivery equivalent quality. This G label promises both excellent corner-to-corner sharpness and beautifully rendered background blur. This lens also features optical image stabilisation, along with dust and moisture resistant construction for outdoor use (Sony claims you can ‘shoot with confidence in light rain’). At 663g, it’s considerably lighter than either its Canon equivalent or the similar Sigma 24-105mm f/4 DG HSM Art, and a little smaller, too. Sony hasn’t skimped on the glass. The 17-element, 14-group optical formula incorporates four aspherical elements to maximize sharpness and reduce distortion, of which two are of the high-precision advanced aspherical type. In addition, three ED glass elements are employed to minimize chromatic aberration. The firm says that with precise control over spherical aberration, the lens should also deliver attractive bokeh. Sony has deployed its Nano AR coating to combat flare and ghosting, while fluorine coating on the front element should help with keeping it clean. A conventional petal-type plastic lens hood is provided that bayonets onto the front of the lens. It doesn’t have a locking button to hold it in place, but it clicks pretty firmly anyway, and it can also be reversed neatly to take up less space in a bag. The lens accepts 77mm filters that won’t rotate on focusing, thanks to an internal-focus design that also means the balance doesn’t change between the infinity setting and the minimum focus distance of 38 cm. Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS build and handling When you come to pick up the FE 24-105mm f/4, you’ll find that despite its relatively light weight, it feels reassuringly solidly built. While the textured barrel surface is clearly designed to mimic the finish of magnesium alloy, tell-tale mould lines and the lack of any coldness to the touch mark it out as plastic instead. There’s nothing wrong with this at all, as it helps keep the weight down with no evident compromise to robustness. A rubber ring around the mount maintains a seal with the camera body. In terms of size, the 25-105mm f/4 sits partway between Sony’s two 24-70mm zooms, being larger than the relatively petite f/4 version but considerably less bulky than the f/2.8 G Master. Looking at pictures of it on the camera, you might wonder whether it’s a bit
        unbalanced, but I didn’t find this to be the case at all; it’s simply a case of supporting the lens with your left hand, just as best hand-holding practice demands. Crucially the combination is much smaller than lighter than even the most compact DSLR equivalent, such as the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS II USM on the EOS 6D Mark II. Like many other FE lenses, the 24-105mm has a narrow cylindrical section immediately ahead of the mount that flares outwards to the main barrel, with the aim being to give enough space for your fingers to wrap around the camera’s handgrip. If you often shoot with gloves on, though, you might find yourself jamming your fingers into what turns out to be a slightly too-small gap. This isn’t really the lens’s fault of course – it’s more down to the compact design of Sony’s full-frame mirrorless cameras. The zoom ring rotates through a quarter-turn from wideangle to telephoto, with the lens extending by approximately 45mm in the process. The slimmer focus-by-wire manual focus ring rotates smoothly, with no end stops or distance scale. Both have nice, grippy, finely-ridged rubberised coverings. Neither is as buttery-smooth as the corresponding controls on the FE 24-70mm f/4 OSS ZA, but even so I had no problem setting precise composition or focus. Two switches on the left side of the barrel are used to select between autofocus and manual, and turn the stabilization on or off. It’s not so long ago such switches seemed to be going the way of the dodo on mirrorless systems, so it’s great to see Sony bringing them back. Both have an identical physical design, though, which makes them difficult to distinguish by touch alone when you have your eye to the viewfinder. Also on the side of the barrel is a large circular button that by default is used to temporarily interrupt AF. But it can be reconfigured to activate a variety of different functions in the camera’s menus, for instance depth of field preview or Sony’s useful Eye-AF function. Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS autofocus When it comes to autofocus, the 24-105mm behaves much like Sony’s other recent FE zooms. It’s very fast and almost completely silent, thanks to the use of a Direct Drive Supersonic Motor that makes it equally at home for video and stills shooting. With static subjects it focuses impressively quickly and accurately, especially on Sony’s latest models such as the Alpha 9 and Alpha 7R III. But even on my older Alpha 7 II, it’s no slouch at all. I did however find some odd behaviour when shooting 20fps bursts on the Alpha 9 with continuous autofocus, with the lens quickly driving itself out-of-focus during the course of a burst, every single time. But the consistency of this issue suggests it should be readily fixed by a camera or lens firmware update, or may indeed just have been caused by an odd settings combination. Switch to manual focus and the lens is perfectly well-behaved. Like all other Sony FE lenses it uses a focus-by-wire design, with the manual focus ring sending movement instructions to the focus group, as opposed to being directly mechanically linked. It works very well, with a decent feel and excellent accuracy, especially when combined with focusing aids such as magnified view. Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS performance Where the FE 24-105mm f/4 OSS really impresses, however, is in its sheer image quality – it’s stunning. I shot it mainly on the 42.4MP Alpha 7R III, which is a tough test for any optic. But it came through with flying colours, delivering superb sharpness from corner-to-corner at every focal length, especially when stopped down to normal full-frame working apertures around f/8 – f/11. Indeed, there’s enough detail for Sony’s Pixel Shift Multi Shot mode to exploit, suggesting the lens will continue to perform well with higher-resolution sensors in future. Usually we expect some compromise when choosing a 4x, 24-105mm zoom over a 3x 24-70mm, but there’s very little in this case, if any. I have no hesitation recommending this lens to A7R users. Examining raw image files helps understand how Sony has pulled off this improbable-sounding feat. Uncorrected files show considerable distortion, which as usual is of the barrel type at wideangle, changing to pincushion across most of the zoom range. Sony can get away with this because it doesn’t have to provide a corrected viewfinder image, as is necessary for DSLRs. As a result, it doesn’t need to incorporate the same degree of resolution-sapping distortion correction into the optical design. Instead the distortion is corrected near-losslessly in software, resulting in excellent overall image quality; simply activate in-camera corrections and you don’t have to worry about it. This is increasingly how modern mirrorless lenses are designed, using digital corrections to replace complex and expensive optical corrections and allowing more extreme or unusual lens designs. Vignetting is visible at f/4 at each end of the zoom, and with a very abrupt drop-off in the
        extreme corners, it might be a problem in some situations. But it can also be suppressed in software, and disappears at f/8 anyway. There’s no visible colour fringing, with lateral chromatic aberration kept low through optical correction, then removed completely in software. As Sony promised, out-of-focus backgrounds are also rendered with an attractive, smooth blur, which isn’t always the case with this kind of lens. The lens is also extremely well behaves when shooting into the light, with minimal loss of contrast and no visible flare patterning from internal reflections (indeed some might find it almost too perfect). Indeed in total, it’s just a phenomenally well-behaved lens Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS – sharpness While the lens is particularly sharp at wideangle according to our Image Engineering MTF50 tests, the real take-home message should be just how consistently it performs from corner to corner at all focal lengths. Technically the sharpest results will be obtained at f/5.6, but the lens also delivers excellent sharpness at f/8 or f/11, which you’ll often need to use to obtain sufficient depth of field. Diffraction-induced softening becomes marked at f/22. Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS – shading Quite strong shading is visible at 24mm and f/4, with a rather sudden falloff into the corners that could potentially be quite disturbing in some images. However it’s much reduced on stopping down to f/5.6, and essentially eliminated at f/8. There’s far less vignetting in the middle of the zoom range, but it reappears at telephoto, showing similar abrupt falloff characteristics but lower magnitude compared to wideangle. Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS – curvilinear distortion In normal use, with in-camera compensation enabled, images display no visible distortion. However with software corrections disabled, the lens shows considerable barrel distortion at wideangle, which quickly changes to strong pincushion distortion at longer focal lengths. However, the simple distortion patterns mean that it’s easy to fix in post-processing, even without using profiled corrections. Most mainstream raw conversion software will apply the requisite corrections automatically.'

      value: The latest flagship device to hit the market is the Sony Xperia 1 V , a follow-on from last year’s Xperia 1 IV and which the company presumably hopes will help to give it some much needed market share away from the bigger players on the market. But how does it compare with some of the best phones for photography ?

      value: The Xiaomi 12T Pro offers a whopping 200MP main camera, but how does this perform, and do the other cameras deliver? Joshua Waller finds out.
    - type: conclusion
      value: Unfortunately, in the camera department, it feels as if Xiaomi spent the majority of their money on the 200MP camera, and then had to cut back on the other cameras, with an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and the almost entirely forgettable 2MP macro camera. It will be interesting to see how the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra , with a 200MP main camera performs in comparison, although it’s worth noting that this is roughly twice the price of the 12T Pro. Another issue is that the 200MP camera doesn’t match the low-light night performance of the Google Pixel 6, or Pixel 7, which are both cheaper (at RRPs), although this can also be said about many other smartphones. Which brings us back round to the conclusion that there’s no real reason for this smartphone to have a 200MP camera over a more normal 48/50MP camera. Perhaps if they did use a 50MP main camera, they could have included a better ultra-wide camera, instead of an 8MP unit, and perhaps we could have seen a telephoto camera? Unfortunately for the 12T Pro, if you buy a Google Pixel 7 , Samsung Galaxy S22 or OnePlus 10 Pro , you’re going to get a better all-round camera system, or even a camera with a telephoto camera unit. Overall, it’s a very nice smartphone, with a better than average amount of storage (at 256GB). However, if camera quality is your highest priority, then there’s a much better camera balance to be found on other (sometimes cheaper) smartphones such as the Google Pixel 7 and Samsung Galaxy S22, with the S22 offering a triple camera setup which includes ultra-wide, wide and telephoto cameras.
    - type: excerpt
      value: The Xiaomi 12T Pro is a mid-range smartphone, and is one of very few smartphones that offer a 200MP main camera . It uses the Samsung ISOCELL HP1 sensor, which offers 16-in-1 pixel binning to give 12.5MP images. Key Features Xiaomi 12T Pro Features Starting with the main camera unit, the 200MP sensor gives a 16-in-1 pixel binning, and this is the default mode, with a 12.5MP image the resolution you get from the majority of the modes. You can, if you want, switch to a 50MP 4-in-1 pixel binning mode for higher-resolution images, or even switch to 200MP images, but these resolutions are only available in specific UltraHD modes , rather than being available in all the different photo modes. In addition to the 200MP camera, you’ll find an 8MP ultra-wide camera , and an almost entirely pointless macro camera, with a very low resolution of 2MP. You’ll also find a 20MP f/2.2 selfie camera with fixed focus. There is a range of long-exposure modes available with six effects (Moving crowd, Oil painting, Neon trails, Light painting, Starry sky, Star trails). The oil-painting option can be used for slow-motion waterfalls and similar. The phone offers incredibly fast charging, up to 120W, with the provided charger and USB cable, as well as a flagship-level main processor, with the Snapdragon 8+ Gen1. 4K video can be recorded at 60fps or 30fps, and there is also an 8K video-recording option, as well as ultra-high-speed video recording up to 1920fps (at a reduced resolution). Handling and Design There are heavily curved corners can be found on the screen in the four corners, however it’s worth noting that the screen does not have curved edges like some flagships. The 12T Pro smartphone is relatively thin, except for the cameras, which jut out of the back of the phone not just once, but twice, with the 200MP camera unit sticking out even further again. Whether this is an issue or not, only time will tell. It does make the smartphone wobble when you place it down on a desk or flat surface. As mentioned earlier, the phone offers incredibly fast charging, up to 120W, however, this is only available with the 120W charger included in the box , along with the specific USB cable in the box. Use other, lower power chargers and you won’t get this speed, and similarly if you lose this USB cable, then you’ll not be able to benefit from the high-speed charging. The Android experience is not too different from other smartphones, and it doesn’t take too long to get used to the layout of apps and settings. It’s also easy to search for settings when needed, making it even easier to use. It’s about time a search function was added to standard cameras. Be aware that some of the shooting modes need to be downloaded before you can use them. This is fine if you’re somewhere with a mobile signal, but could be awkward if you find yourself without mobile signal or enough data to download the shooting mode(s). Xiaomi 12T Pro Performance and Image Quality General image quality is middling, with somewhat washed-out colours depending on the shooting conditions. There are also inconsistent results from shot to shot, with the camera sometimes producing HDR images, and other times giving a washed-out sky. Focus struggled at times, particularly when trying to photograph subjects closer to the camera. UltraHD 50MP + 200MP images If you shoot using the 50MP option then you can see more detail in images. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for when you shoot using the 200MP option, with the image simply giving you a more pixelated view and an unmanageable file size (both in megapixels and megabytes). As a result, for the most part, you’re simply going to be better off using the standard photo modes, with 12MP images, as this lets you access all the different shooting modes available, such as portrait, etc. Ultra-wideangle 8MP camera The ultra-wideangle camera gives you 8MP images that aren’t particularly impressive, but should suffice when used on social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram where images are shown at a lower resolution. If you view the images in detail, there are soft corners, with clear distortion, and low levels of detail. There is also, on occasion issues with dynamic range when using this camera. 2MP Macro camera The dedicated macro camera on the 12T Pro has a fixed focus, and produces 2MP images. This is, as expected, fairly poor, and you can get noticeably better results simply by using the main camera and using 2x digital zoom, and then you get a 12.5MP image with better bokeh, and noticeably more detail. Motion mode(s) Water smoothing works well, giving you control over how long the exposure is when using the Water Painting mode, which creates smoothed-over water. This is an improvement over some other phone cameras that do not give you control over how long the exposure is. The front-facing 20MP f/2.2 selfie camera gives good results as long as you don’t spend your time ‘pixel peeping’, with results looking good on
        screen. As the lens has a fixed focus point, at roughly arms length away from the phone, there is a sweet spot for focus, and this gives a slightly blurred background, which can be increased by selecting the portrait mode. Video performance Video recording in 4K lets you use 60fps or 30fps, but doesn’t give the option of 25 or 24fps, which is fairly common for most smartphones. Video recording gives good results, although care needs to be taken when panning to help keep video looking smooth. Value for Money The Xiaomi 12T Pro is available from $590 / £649 sim-free. This puts it up against a number of other smartphones around this price point, although it’s worth noting that the 12T Pro comes with 256GB storage, which is more than most other smartphones at this price point. Alternatives include the Google Pixel 7 – with full-resolution ultra-wide (12MP), and wideangle (50MP) cameras, with a 2x digital super resolution zoom, which is cheaper at £599. There’s also the Samsung Galaxy S22 – again with full-resolution ultra-wide (12MP), wideangle (50MP), and telephoto (10MP) cameras, with a price of around £699 (depending on version). Another option is the OnePlus 10 Pro , with 50MP ultra-wide, 48MP wide, and 8MP telephoto cameras, available for £799.

    - type: conclusion
      value: The Oppo Reno8 Pro proves that you don’t necessarily need to buy a flagship smartphone to get a decent camera. Its main camera in particular delivers good results across a range of shooting conditions, while the special modes such as Portrait, Night and Panorama all work very well. If you mainly want your smartphone to be a dependable point-and-shoot for posting snaps and video clips to social media, it’ll do the job perfectly well at a relatively palatable price point. If you’re looking to buy an Android phone in this price bracket, the Reno8 Pro counts as a viable alternative to the Google Pixel 6 and Google Pixel 7. I suspect most people will consider it to be more attractively designed, although its camera system perhaps isn’t quite as good overall. Not surprisingly, though, if you’re prepared to fork out almost twice the money for a flagship device such as the OPPO Find X5 Pro , you’ll get something that’s a whole lot better. In comparison, the Reno8 Pro has a lower-quality ultra-wide camera and no telephoto lens at all, with a pointless macro camera in its place. It can’t record DNG raw files either, but with all the multi-shot computational wizardry that’s routinely used by smartphone cameras, I’m not convinced this is a major drawback. Overall, though, it’s very much a case of you get what you pay for.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'OPPO’s Reno line represents the middle tier of its smartphone range, below the premium Find series that includes the flagship OPPO Find X5 Pro . At $540 / £449 , the OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G heads a three-strong line-up, alongside the more affordable Reno8 and Reno8 Lite. Could this be one of the best budget phones available? Find out in our review. OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G At a glance: Oppo is particularly keen to promote its photographic capabilities, with the Reno8 Pro being distinguished from its cheaper siblings by its inclusion of the MariSilicon X neural processing unit (NPU), inherited from the Find X5 Pro. This promises improved image quality in low light, especially for video. Keep reading for our full review, but also don’t forget to check out our guide to how to take better smartphone photos. With smartphones having decimated the compact camera market, they’re now the pocket point-and-shoot camera of choice for most people. The received wisdom is that serious photographers should buy flagship models in the £1,000 bracket to get the best cameras, but many will baulk at spending such a sum, especially in the current climate. So what compromises come from stepping down a level? OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G: Features and design Measuring 161.2×74.2×7.3mm and with a 6.7in, 20:9 screen, the OPPO Reno8 Pro is similar in size to most other current mid-range or high-end Android phones. As with the Find X5 Pro, it uses a metal unibody design with Gorilla Glass front and back, which makes a positive impression quality-wise. Unlike its stablemate, though, the Reno8 Pro is slab-like and angular, with flat sides rather than smooth curves, which means it’s not especially comfortable to hold. Thankfully the edges are chamfered and not completely sharp. The highly polished back is, however, very slippery indeed. This device will slide out of your hand, or off a not-completely-flat surface, at the drop of a hat. I made a point of holding it carefully two-handed whenever I used the camera, and would definitely invest in a case (you don’t get one in the box). The device has an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, which means it should survive being accidentally splashed. But unlike more expensive models, it’s not protected against being submerged. Naturally, Oppo claims this is the most powerful Reno model yet, with its MediaTek Dimensity 8100-MAX processor backed up by 8GB RAM and 256GB storage . It certainly feels snappy in operation, with screens scrolling smoothly and apps such as Lightroom opening and running responsively. The device is powered by a 4,500 mAh battery that OPPO says can be charged to 50% in just 10 minutes, using the 80W USB-C power block that comes in the box. The firm also claims that the battery should maintain 80% of its capacity across 1,600 charge cycles, equating to more than four years normal use. This is good news, with consumers now tending to own and use devices for rather longer than in the past. A slim bulge at the top left corner houses the camera setup, with the main and wideangle lenses emphasised by oversized circular glass covers. The power button is conventionally placed on the right-hand side, while the volume control buttons are found on the left. Double-clicking either of these can activate the camera app when the phone is in standby, and they can be used to take pictures, too. At the base of the device, you’ll find the SIM tray and the USB-C port. OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G: Camera system Purely in terms of specification, the Reno8 Pro’s camera setup is a step down from the Find X5 series. The firm’s marketing materials proudly proclaim that it employs ‘Dual Sony Flagship Sensors’, but this refers to the 50MP sensor used for the main camera , and the 32MP unit for the front-facing selfie camera . Unlike on the Find X5 Pro, the ultra-wide camera is considerably lower spec’ed and there’s no telephoto camera at all, with the device relying on digital zoom instead. But that’s expected at this price point. Let’s look at the hardware specs in more detail. The Reno8 Pro’s main camera pairs a 50MP sensor of the 1/1.56in-type (measuring 8.2×6.1mm) with a 23mm-equivalent f/1.8 wideangle lens. The sensor supports phase-detection autofocus anywhere in the frame, but there’s no optical image stabilisation. It’s joined by a 16mm equivalent f/2.2 ultra-wideangle camera, which uses an 8MP sensor of the much smaller 1/4in-type (3.2 x 2.4mm). There’s also a 2MP macro camera with a 22mm equivalent f/2.4 lens. As for the selfie camera, this is a 32MP affair with autofocus and a 90° angle of view. Video recording is available in 4K at 30fps , or Full HD at 60fps . Oppo has included its 4K Ultra Night Video and 4K Ultra HDR Video , both of which are enabled by the MariSilicon X NPU. They’re pretty self-explanatory – the former promises high-quality video in very low light, while the latter aims to balance extremes of lighting in the same scene, for example a subject in shade against a bright sky. Both operate
        entirely automatically, with no user intervention required. With smartphones highly reliant on computational photography, the inclusion of the NPU promises great things compared to the cheaper models in the Reno8 range. As we’ll see, though, it can’t make up for the smaller sensor of the wide camera, or do anything to fix the macro camera’s measly 2MP resolution. OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G: Camera app On the Reno8 Pro, Oppo has used a conventional Android camera app that’s simple and intuitive to use. Tapping the icon initially opens the fully automatic Photo mode , which offers a basic set of options. The zoom control lets you select between the main and ultra-wide cameras, or engage a 2x digital zoom. This is essentially a 12MP crop from the centre of the main camera’s 50MP sensor. You’ll find touch buttons for controlling the LED flash, HDR mode, AI image enhancement, self-timer and aspect ratio. There’s also a 50MP mode, although naturally, it limits you to using the main camera only. A selection of image-processing filters is available, including a nice Black & White mode alongside various more whimsical options. The camera records JPEG or HEIF files only, so filter effects are baked into the final image. Switch to Pro mode and you get manual control over shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation, focus and white balance, with a live histogram to help judge your exposure settings. But Pro mode comes with some significant limitations. You can’t use the ultra-wide camera, and unlike most flagship Android phones, there’s no option to record DNG raw files, either. Specialist photographic modes include Night, Portrait, Panorama and Macro, with the latter being the only apparent means of engaging the specialist macro camera. There’s also an ‘Ultra HD’ high-resolution multi-shot mode that constructs 108 MP images. In the standard Video mode , 4K recording is available using the main camera , again with a touch button for 2x digital zoom. However, engaging the ultra-wide camera switches down to Full HD resolution, as does enabling the Ultra Steady setting that provides enhanced electronic stabilisation. Oppo has also included a more advanced Film mode in the camera app, which provides manual control of exposure and records in a widescreen 20:9 aspect ratio. But curiously, this is only at 2400×1080 resolution, and not 4K. OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G: Angle of view comparison OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G: Image quality When you come to examine photos taken with the Oppo Reno8 Pro, a theme quickly emerges. The main camera delivers very nice images, not only at its native 24mm wideangle setting, but also with up to 2x digital zoom. Unfortunately, though, the other cameras aren’t nearly as good. Let’s look at this in greater detail. The main camera is capable of giving really attractive images, with warm, vibrant colours and plenty of detail across the frame. As has become the norm with smartphones, it also exploits computational photography to balance bright skies against dark backgrounds in a very natural-looking fashion, in a way that conventional cameras just can’t match. If you pull your image files off the phone and examine them close-up on a computer screen, they’ll look decidedly over-processed, but to be fair this isn’t how they’re expected to be viewed. Switch to the ultra-wide lens, and you’ll find that the image quality drops substantially. The colours look dull and muted in comparison to the main camera, even when viewed on the phone’s screen. It should come as no great surprise to find that the 8MP sensor delivers visibly less detail than the main camera, but this is compounded by the extra processing required to suppress image noise with the smaller sensor. The images are still acceptable for social media use, which, of course, is where they’ll mostly end up. But they’re nowhere near as good as those from the Find X5 Pro’s ultra-wide camera, which employs the same, much larger image sensor as the main camera. Engage the specialist macro mode , and the device will tell you to shoot at 4cm from the subject to get the best results. At this point, alarm bells will be ringing for any photographer who’s ever shot close-ups. Predictably, when you place this rectangular slab 4cm from your subject, you’ll usually find yourself blocking out your own light. Even worse, the image files returned by the 2MP macro camera are awful, with muted colours and very little detail. You’re much better off moving the device back from your subject and using the main camera with digital zoom, which gives better colour, increased detail, and more attractive bokeh, too. The other special modes generally do a nice job, though. Portrait mode works well with both the main and selfie cameras, detecting human subjects and blurring the background convincingly. Night mode impresses, too, although Oppo’s implementation is subtly different to other companies. It doesn’t necessarily shoot a longer exposure than the standard Photo mode, but instead does a far better
        job of balancing the extremes of lighting found in night-time scenes, maintaining detail in highlights that would otherwise get clipped to white. Switch the main camera to 50MP output , and you’ll find that this can deliver visibly more detail, at least in good light. I wasn’t convinced by the 108MP Ultra HD mode, though, which delivers minimal extra resolution while being prone to ghosting artefacts from anything that moves. It gives the impression of being a feature that’s been added mainly as a marketing counterpoint to the 108MP sensors used by some other phones. Panorama mode works very well, though, giving detailed images with no visible stitching errors. Video quality is very creditable, with plenty of detail and clear sound, although it doesn’t take much wind to overwhelm the microphones. In daylight, Oppo’s Ultra HDR 4K Video works extremely well to balance bright skies against a darker subject, without the user having to do anything. Likewise, 4K Ultra Night Video allows the camera to give natural-looking results in very low light, such as under street lighting. But again, the main camera delivers considerably better results than the ultra-wide, especially when light levels drop. With no optical stabilisation, the device is entirely reliant on digital stabilisation. This does a reasonable job of keeping things steady when you pan across a scene, but isn’t up to the job of stabilising footage recorded while you’re walking. The Ultra Steady setting is visibly more effective, but it comes with a serious penalty in terms of detail, as it only records in Full HD with a field-of-view crop. OPPO Reno8 Pro 5G: Value for Money At $540 / £599, the Oppo Reno8 Pro goes head-to-head with the Google Pixel 6 (now surpassed by the Google Pixel 7 ), which until recently we considered the best camera phone below $600 / £600. It’s also almost the same price as the Apple iPhone SE in its 256GB configuration. You certainly get a lot more camera for your money compared to the single-lensed iPhone SE, but against the Pixel 6, it’s more a case of swings and roundabouts. The Reno8 Pro looks more stylish, boasts double the memory, and its camera app offers a greater degree of manual control. But the Pixel 6 includes better imaging hardware, with its main camera including a larger sensor and optical stabilisation. Its main and ultra-wide cameras are also properly matched in terms of colour output, while the camera app includes a host of useful and easy-to-use shooting modes. It’s probably fair to say that the Oppo Reno8 Pro is the more attractive of the two devices, but the Google Pixel 6 has a (slightly) better camera.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: One area where the Pixel 6 could improve is by giving more control to the user, as it would be good to be able to tone down the HDR look of images. A fully manual mode would also be useful, especially if you want to learn more about how to take photos. However, this doesn’t look very likely. The selfie camera also lags behind some, as Samsung’s flagships offer AF, rather than fixed focus, and 4K video too. Video is another area where the Pixel 6 is somewhat lacking. It will record 4K 60fps video with great image stabilisation but other smartphones offer more. The iPhone 13 series and Samsung S21 series lead the way, offering a number of background blur and cinematic options, as well as 8K video on the Samsung. But for stills photography, the Pixel 6 still has imaging technologies to compete with more expensive smartphones and, in terms of clever computational imaging, regular cameras.
    - type: excerpt
      value: The Google Pixel 6 may be the bargain of the year when it comes to smartphones. It offers almost all the same features as the Pixel 6 Pro , minus the 4x telephoto camera, but is considerably cheaper, making this premium smartphone seriously good value for mone y. But there’s more to it than value for money, as we look at what makes the Pixel 6 (and Pro) unique, thanks to some impressive computational photography features. Of course, since the launch of the Pixel 6, the Google Pixel 7 has come along, raising the bar again for premium smartphones. But this has driven prices for the Pixel 6 down, which is good news for bargain hunters prepared to forgo the latest generation in tech in exchange for a substantial cost saving. The Pixel 6 should not be confused with the Google Pixel 6a . This might sound like a newer or updated version of the Pixel 6, but it’s actually a stripped-down budget variant. The regular Pixel 6 is becoming a little harder to find new but is still worth searching out, as we’ll see. Pixel 6 At a Glance Google Pixel 6 – Hardware, design and features Google developed its own smartphone processor, the Google Tensor, and Google says that with this high-performance, machine-learning processor, it’s able to bring amazing photo features, including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, as well as Speech enhancement and HDRnet for video. Other impressive photo features include a Magic Eraser that makes removing unwanted objects from images incredibly easy and quick. Google likes to give its phones a unique look, not only in terms of colours, and the Pixel 6 is no different, with a grey/black model (Stormy Black) available as well as Sorta Seaform (green-ish), and Kinda Coral (cream / pinkish). There’s also a unique camera bar along the back that gives them a different look to all other smartphones. In this bar you’ll find the ultra-wideangle camera, as well as the wideangle (standard) camera. However, it is lacking the 4x telephoto camera that the 6 Pro features. This camera ‘bar’ might prove divisive as a styling feature, but it helps distinguish the Google Pixel 6 from rival brands. The main camera on the rear uses a 50MP 1/1.31in sensor and f/1.85 lens, with OIS, and Laser AF. The main camera and the ultra-wide cameras both output 12MP images, even though the main camera has a 50MP sensor. As with most modern smartphones, the Google Pixel 6 uses a pixel-binning (pixel combining) process to produce images for everyday use. The front, selfie camera is an 8MP f/2 fixed-focus selfie camera, with an 84° field of view. The camera bar gives a good area to grip on to when holding the phone, but the rear, sides and screen are all particularly slippery, so a rubberised case is highly recommended if you want the device to stay on desks and other surfaces, otherwise it’ll be quite happy to slip off. The Google Pixel 6 comes with 128GB storage, and 12GB RAM. With the 6 Pro you get the option to have more storage, but on the 6, the only option is 128GB currently. With no MicroSD memory expansion available, this could be an issue for some people, depending on how you use your storage. The screen is a 6.4in OLED display with a 20:9 aspect ratio, a Full HD+ resolution, and a variable refresh rate up to 90Hz. The screen is flat, and the borders are quite noticeable, especially in comparison to the curved screen on the Pixel 6 Pro. Styling conventions change quickly in the world of smartphones. This is a flagship smartphone, so you’ll also find stereo speakers built-in, IP68 protection, as well as scratch resistance claimed to be two times better than previous Pixel phones, thanks to the use of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. However, as with other glass phones, a case is highly recommended, not just to protect the phone from damage but also to make it a little less slippery to handle. Wireless charging is supported, and Google says the Tensor chip means lower power consumption compared to previous Pixel smartphones. However, we found battery drain appeared quite rapid when the ‘always on’ display feature was used. We also found the phone was particularly fussy when it came to charging, rejecting a Huawei charger, car charger, and car stereo with USB. As a result, we had to buy a new charger, even though Google is trying to ‘save the planet’ by not including a charger in the box. Google Pixel 6 Performance – Image Quality The Motion Blur feature gives you the option of Action Pan or Long Exposure. We focused on the long-exposure option to create long-exposure waterfall shots. Sure, you could probably do this with a smartphone with manual controls, and perhaps an ND filter if you could work out how to attach it, plus a tripod and mobile adapter. However, the simplicity of pointing this phone at a scene, handheld, and taking amazing blurred movement shots is incredible. The only other actual camera that makes this almost this easy is the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III with built-in Live ND. This raises an interesting point
        about smartphones vs regular cameras. Not only are smartphones more convenient than cameras, being smaller and easier to use (for the most part), but also they have much better sharing features. Being constantly connected to a mobile network means you can easily share images straight away, for a start. Smartphones also starting to chip away at the areas of photography that were previously only possible with a ‘proper’ camera. If camera companies don’t start embracing computational photography, then people are going to start asking questions like, ‘Why do I need to use a dedicated camera to achieve this, when my mobile phone can already do it? And it’s significantly easier as well…’ The Google Pixel 6 is also cheaper than most ‘proper’ cameras, though in fairness the reduced image quality and controls, and the lack of interchangeable lenses, should be taken into account too. In addition to Motion, the camera also features Night Sight mode , which has been a feature on Google Pixel phones for a long time. Night Sight lets you take low-light night photos without the need for a tripod. The mode combines multiple images, and you can often end up with an image that has a hyper-HDR look, depending what’s in your scene, as shown above. The Google Pixel 4 introduced an astrophotography mode that delivers even more impressive star photographs. The camera will automatically detect when it is stable, and then allow for even longer exposures capturing more detail. Using the smartphone on a tripod, the camera decided to take a 4-minute exposure, producing the image below using a much lower ISO speed, which is greatly improved over the handheld shot. In addition, the camera automatically produced a short timelapse of the stars moving across the sky. The portrait mode gives an impressive level of background blur (or bokeh), and for the most part this works well enough, giving a more impressive-looking image compared to a standard photo. However, for those who are used to using portrait lenses on ‘real’ cameras, the effect won’t be as attractive, particularly around the subject’s hair, where fine detail can often be blurred, giving an unnatural look. Portraits also benefit from improved skin tones and colours as part of Google’s new Real Tone , designed to better reflect the beauty of all skin tones. However, saying this, images and skin tones can look overly HDR’d at times, and selfies can lack detail (due to the 8MP selfie camera). If you do use the LED flash, then this has a yellow tone which can give your images a warmer look. As the camera takes multiple images for each shot and merges them together, you get significantly more dynamic range than you would with a normal camera. The Pixel 6’s processing can mean your images look overly HDR and colours can also look a little bit off if you’re used to using standard cameras and non-HDR settings. You do get the option to shoot raw and JPEG images, but no option to switch off HDR, as even the raw DNG files are not true raw files, but instead have HDR baked into them. You do at least still get the benefits of computational photography when opening raw files in Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom etc. The ultra-wideangle camera doesn’t offer as wide a view as some of the main competitors, with the iPhone 13 Pro offering a wider ultra-wide lens. However, images do look very good, with colours matching the standard camera. The main camera offers up to 7x super-resolution zoom, combining multiple images to produce results with more detail than a standard digital zoom would. However, we’d say that beyond 2x zoom, images don’t look particularly good, and they aren’t a match for a true smartphone telephoto camera. Video offers 4K 60fps recording, with good image stabilisation, as well as good low-light performance. While the camera automatically records video in HDR, it doesn’t offer the same features as some other smartphones. Google said it was working on the video quality, which was originally found to be slightly lacking in Jon Devo’s Google Pixel 6 Pro review . Google says this is a long-term project, and it may take some time to improve.

    - type: excerpt
      value: Now that the Nothing Phone 2 has been released, is the Nothing Phone 1 still a good buy? For starters, it’s now even cheaper, at $372 / £289 (a reduction from $469 / £400). It sits in the mid-range to budget end of the market, and offers a unique design that may actually have some benefits when it comes to low-light photography . Let’s find out how this smartphone performs as a photographic tool. At a glance Nothing Phone 1 features Available in black or white, the design may remind you of an iPhone , and this does appear to be somewhat deliberate, with a silver frame and rather chunky styling. The rear of the phone is where you’ll find perhaps the standout feature of the phone, and that’s in the form of the “ GLYPH ” lights, which are made-up of 900 tiny LEDs. These can be used as notification lights , with a funky light show on offer, or alternatively you can use them to give a more gentle illumination for anything you’re photographing, whether that’s people or objects. There is, of course, a more traditional LED flash , which is much brighter, for when you need extra light. The rear of the phone features a glass back with Gorilla Glass 5 protection, which lets you see into the detail and construction of the phone, with the tiny screws visible. This looks great, and is a real conversation starter, but in reality the notification Glyphs fairly quickly turn from a novelty into a mostly forgettable feature – you can’t see them when you’re using the phone normally, with the screen facing you, for example. However, for photography they may prove much more useful. The rear 50MP cameras include a standard f/1.9 aperture wideangle lens with 24mm-equivalent view and optical image stabilisation (OIS), plus an ultra-wideangle f/2.2 lens with 14mm equivalent (0.6x) and autofocus. Both cameras use Quad Bayer sensors giving 12MP images . There is no third telephoto or macro camera to be found here, but you can use digital zoom if necessary, and the ultra-wideangle lens with AF lets you get as close as 4cm for macro shots . There’s a 16MP f/2.5 selfie camera with a wideangle view with no autofocus, although with a Quad Bayer sensor you’re effectively getting just 4MP of colour information, even though images are output at 16MP. The screen is a 6.55in OLED with a FullHD+ resolution (2400×1080), 120Hz refresh, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for protection and scratch resistance. Thanks to the OLED display, the Nothing Phone 1 is able to offer an always-on display with minimal battery usage . Built-in stereo speakers help give decent sound, and NFC can be found on the back, making it suitable for Google Pay. Battery life is relatively good with a 4500mAh battery, and wireless charging is included, as well as an under-screen fingerprint sensor, which is impressive for the price point. The phone has an IP53 rating , so you’ll not need to be too careful about getting the phone slightly wet. Again, this is impressive considering the price. The Android version on the phone is up to v13, and is relatively standard (or stock), and gives a snappy performance, despite the phone not featuring a flagship processor. The camera app lets you use the usual photo, portrait, and night modes, as well as a macro mode, and there’s also an expert (or Pro) mode available with support for raw photos . Nothing Phone 1 performance and image quality The wideangle camera features PDAF (phase-detection autofocus) and OIS (optical image stabilisation), with a 24mm-equivalent view . It features the largest sensor of the three cameras on this phone, and gives the best results of the three cameras, giving good colour, and good night photography performance when using the night mode. The Nothing Phone 1’s ultra-wideangle camera includes AF and is shown as a 0.6x option on the phone, this gives roughly a 14mm equivalent. It performs well for macro shots , with a close focus distance, but for a shot such as this, above, with trees in the frame, you don’t need to enlarge it to see the strong distortion and lower image quality towards the edges of the frame. The GLYPH lights can be effectively used to give a more three-dimensional look to images, without the harshness of the Nothing Phone 1’s LED flash. If you just want to add a little bit of extra light to a scene, they work well, while also keeping more of the background in the shot (without it appearing underexposed). This may be of particular interest to people who find the LED flash on smartphones overly harsh. Macro performance can be very good from both cameras, with a close-focus distance from the ultra-wideangle camera of just 4cm. However, the camera doesn’t automatically switch to the ultra-wideangle camera (in the normal photo mode) so you’ll need to manually switch to it, or go and select the macro mode before benefitting from this. The main camera can also focus relatively close as well, giving great results. More sample photos from the Nothing Phone 1 The selfie camera is somewhat average,
        using a Quad Bayer 16MP camera, meaning you get effectively 4MP of colour detail in pictures. This is a little lacking compared to other phones, lacking autofocus, and only offering FullHD video, it can’t compete with other smartphones that offer AF, and/or 4K video recording on the selfie-camera. However, at this price point, the Nothing Phone 1 can easily be forgiven. The rear cameras offer video recording at up to 4K resolution at 30fps. When recording video there is a red tally light on the back of the phone. Value for money The Nothing Phone 1 is up against some fairly stiff competition, with Google offering the Google Pixel 6a for $384 / £299. The Pixel 6a offers a similar camera setup, but consistently gives excellent images from all cameras, something the Nothing 1 can sometimes struggle with. The lack of a dedicated macro mode on the Pixel 6a may make the Nothing Phone 1 a better choice. Other alternatives might include some of Samsung’s A series phones, and the entry-level iPhone SE, although this is lacking in the camera department with just one camera on the back. If the Nothing Phone 1 is on offer in your area, then it could easily be seen as a bit of a bargain (and by bit, we mean a massive bargain, such is the English language).

    - type: conclusion
      value: Even though it’s one generation old, the Google Pixel 6a still very much has its place in the line-up. Google’s decision to upscale the 7a and simultaneously drop the price of the 6a is looking like a smart one. Rather than having two near-identikit phones jostling for your attention, picking between the two is a choice between two genuinely different propositions. And it also makes the Pixel 6a some of the best value for money you can get on the smartphone market right now. The Google Pixel 6a offers a great dual-camera system with a very good ultra-wide camera, as well as a good to very good wide-angle camera. And, whilst it may not match the flagship smartphones such as the Pixel 6 / Pixel 6 Pro , it comes very close to the performance, with excellent colours, exposure, dynamic range and detail. Realistically, if you want a smartphone camera system that’s radically better than this, you’re going to be looking at spending quite a bit more money. The Pixel 6a still does an excellent job of punching above its weight class, and a year and change down the line from launch, you’re not exactly getting a decrepit, outdated smartphone. The Pixel 6a also benefits from the impressive computational photography features such as Night sight, magic eraser, and astrophotography, which are great features to have, and difficult to beat. There are a few things missing, of course. The main one is a telephoto camera; the Pixel 6a sports a reasonable enough 2x digital zoom, but this is nowhere at all when you compare it to smartphones with dedicated optical tele lenses. There’s no dedicated macro mode either; while you can fudge a decent-ish close-up with the 2x zoom, once again, it’s no match for phones with dedicated macro lenses. Neither of these are things we’d particularly expect to see on a camera at this price, and if you want them badly, you’re looking at getting something like the Pixel 7 . Ultimately, the price drop of the Pixel 6a means it’s one of the best-value smartphones you can buy right now, and as long as you’re comfortable with what it can and can’t do, you can be confident you’re getting a great phone at an outrageously good price.

      value: 'Cheap but capable, the Google Pixel 6a is made for those who want a decent phone from a reputable brand, but don’t have too much budget to spend. It originally launched alongside the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro , sitting beneath them in the line-up. The Google Pixel 6a is no longer Google’s newest budget smartphone. Its successor, the Google Pixel 7a , was announced in May 2023 – however, this wasn’t just an iterative update. Google elected to throw a lot of tech into making the Pixel 7a a substantive upgrade. One of the most significant additions was the inclusion of the same Tensor G2 chipset that powers the mid-range Pixel 7. While this doesn’t affect the baseline performance too much, it enables a number of clever AI-powered features, like Photo Unblur. Another was the big resolution bump given to the main camera, going from a 12MP f/1.7 wide to a 64MP f/1.9. As is standard in smartphones, it’s not actually using all these pixels in the pictures it creates, but is binning a significant number of them to improve the light-gathering ability of its sensor. All this makes the Pixel 7a a pretty different proposition to the 6a – and so, rather than discontinuing the 6a, Google has kept it in circulation for now, and done something rather welcome. They’ve dropped the price. These days, the Pixel 6a can be picked up for around $314/£299; while prices do fluctuate, they aren’t straying far from this mark, and consequently it could be a real contender for one of the best cheap smartphones you can buy. The only way to be sure, however, is to put the Google Pixel 6a to the test. In this review we’re focusing on the phone’s camera capabilities, assessing its image quality and the various shooting modes it offers. Is it a good enough phone to justify your attention, or did Google cut too many corners? Are you better off biting the bullet and paying for the newer Pixel 7a. Find out as we get into our Google Pixel 6a review. For more options, check out our guides to the best camera phones and the best budget camera phones . Google Pixel 6a: Features The Pixel 6a may be $100/£100 cheaper than the Pixel 6, with a 12MP ultra-wide camera, as well as a 12MP wide-angle (standard) camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) . Where the Pixel 6a differs from its higher-end sibling, the Pixel 6, is in the standard camera’s specifications, with the Pixel 6 offering a 48MP camera with a larger sensor, and an additional AI “motion” mode. Almost all photography features and processing remains the same on both models, with the Pixel 6a also offering intelligent AI (Artificial Intelligence) features including ‘magic eraser’ letting you remove objects from the background of photographs, but motion blur (for smooth water shots) is missing. Like the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, the 6a features Google’s TENSOR processor, as well as an in-screen fingerprint reader, but has 6GB of RAM, rather than the 8GB found on the Pixel 6. There’s a smaller 6.1inch screen compared to the 6.4inch screen on the 6, and the 6.71-inch screen on the 6 Pro. The 6 Pro also benefits from a 4x telephoto camera, whilst the 6 and 6a rely on an intelligent/hybrid 2x digital zoom. There are some differences to be found in the build quality of the 6a, as the rear of the smartphone is made of plastic, compared to Gorilla Glass 6 / Victus on the others. The screen uses Gorilla Glass 3, compared to Victus on the more premium models. Key features Google Pixel 6a: Handling The Pixel 6a is extremely compact and lightweight compared to most premium smartphones, which tend to offer larger screens. For those who prefer smaller smartphones, then the 6a could be a great choice, although for protection it’s likely you’ll want to add a case to the smartphone. You’ll also find that the phone is extremely slippery, and a case would help give you a better grip (you don’t get one in the box, nor does the smartphone come with a charger). The Pixel 6a features the same design camera bar on the rear as the 6 and 6 Pro, however, on the 6a this is much thinner, and the phone is much flatter when placed on a flat surface. You also benefit from IP67 waterproof and dust proof rating, which is impressive for a mid-range phone – the Pixel 6 offers IP68. Shooting features include a number of mostly automatic modes, and there are no manual or “Pro” modes available, which could frustrate those who want to use these. The Pixel 6a is also missing some of the more impressive shooting modes that are found on the Pixel 6 and 6 PRO, which includes the “Motion” mode, which is seriously impressive on the 6/6PRO, and it’s a real shame that these aren’t available on the Pixel 6a – see our Google Pixel 6 review to find out why. However, Magic eraser can be used after taking a photo, to remove background objects such as people (or objects) you would rather not be in the scene. This can work well, as long as you don’t go overboard, and try and remove whole sections of the image. Night Sight – The night mode is
        called “Night Sight”, and it works with both the ultra-wide camera and standard camera. On a solid or stable surface, the smartphone will detect a stable platform, and will automatically switch to the astrophotography mode, using a longer exposure to give a much improved night shot, capable of capturing stars in the sky. A time-lapse can be automatically created when shooting astrophotography, and this will put together a short video clip for you, showing the stars move across the sky for example. The portrait mode zooms into the image slightly, and gives a blurred background. The phone also benefits from “real-tone” which is designed to give realistic skin tones, and the selfie (front facing) camera on the phone is an 8MP camera built-in to the screen with an f/2 aperture. There’s also a panorama mode, photo sphere, as well as a “Lens” option that will use the camera to detect items in the scene providing additional information from the internet. RAW+JPEG can be switched on saving both the standard JPEG and a raw DNG file. Google Pixel 6a: Image quality and performance Images from the ultra-wide camera look good, with reasonable amounts of detail. The same ultra-wide camera unit is used in the whole range of Pixel 6 smartphones from the 6a, up to the 6 PRO. Distortion is visible if you have images with straight lines near the edges of the frame, but for the most part this isn’t an issue. Images from the standard camera’s wide-angle lens give good results, with excellent exposure and dynamic range, thanks to an automatic multi-shot HDR mode that is switched on by default. There are times when images can appear too obviously “HDR” and unfortunately there are not options to turn this off or tone this down. For most people the results will be extremely pleasing. Low-light performance is very good for a mid-range smartphone, however when comparing images next to the same shots taken with the Pixel 6, it’s clear to see that there is a benefit to be found from the larger sensor. However, despite this, it still offers very good low-light performance, and even offers an astrophotography mode when the camera detects either a stable surface, or tripod being used. There is an option to shoot at 2x zoom using the main camera, and this takes multiple shots, combining them to give an image with improved quality and detail compared to standard digital zoom. The results are slightly better than expected, but do not match the performance of a true telephoto camera, and you can tell that detail is lacking. You can zoom beyond 2x but it’s not recommended as image quality does degrade. Video recording gives options up to 4K resolution, and up to 60fps recording, with good image stabilisation, as well as good low-light performance. You’ll also find time-lapse, and slow-motion video options, with up to 4x and 8x slow-motion available, albeit at a reduced resolution. Google Pixel 6a: Value for money There are a number of alternative smartphones in the £300-500 price range, with options including the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G (£449), Honor 70 (£350), and OPPO Reno 8 Pro (£399), however it’s worth noting that none of these offer a telephoto camera. Also, thanks to the Pixel 6a’s post-launch price drop, they’re all significantly more expensive. Considering the Pixel 6a offers almost the same camera system as the Pixel 6 , with almost the same computational photography, but for more than £100 less, the Pixel 6a offers excellent value for money at current prices. However, if you’re able to find the Pixel 6 on offer then it offers exceptional value for money, as it has been available for around £430-460.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The Google Pixel 7 a lovely mid-price phone with enough features and performance to keep most users happy, especially at its current price which is $599/£599 for the 128GB version. The lack of a telephoto and a macro camera are negatives and if you want those features and a bigger display then go for the Pixel 7 Pro . The 128GB version is now $599/£724 from $899/£849, and the 256GB is $699/£824 from $999/£949. However, if you don’t want to stretch that far, then you will still get an excellent camera system from the Pixel 7, and this includes an improved selfie-camera, quicker night mode, as well as general phone improvements, including a quicker fingerprint sensor, support for face-unlock, and a slightly smaller design and body. Like the Pixel 7 Pro, the lack of a Pro or Manual mode on the Pixel 7 could be a deal breaker for some, as for some people this can be genuinely useful. But if you don’t want to spend flagship money on a smartphone and simply want an excellent camera system, then the Pixel 7 offers an excellent combination of features, for a great price. At this price you get a great main camera, a very good ultra-wide, and a decent selfie camera. Whilst we’d love to see a macro mode, we think the computational photography features help make up for this. Still, since this is a mid-range phone, we have another question to answer – does it do enough to justify itself over the cheaper Pixel 7a? This is a tricky one, as the two phones really are very similar. Displays are near-identical, with just a couple of tenths of an inch separating them. And what’s more, despite costing less, the Pixel 7a packs in a newer 64MP f/1.9 main camera. This may make it sounds like the 7a is just better in every way, but it’s not that simple, as Google claims the sensor in the Pixel 7 is larger and offers greater light sensitivity. It may well do. But in practice, images from the two phones look pretty similar, as the computational photography on offer is amongst the best in both the Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7a, with some really useful photographic features, including motion blur, astrophotography, and for portraits real tone. There is of course the issue of some images looking like they’ve had the HDR settings turned up to the max, and there is no way to avoid this without shooting raw, but if you can get used to this, then you’ll be very pleased with the images this smartphone produces. Both mostly have the same modes on offer, though the Pixel 7 has Action Pan and the 7a doesn’t. The Pixel 7 also offers a few more advantages of its own over the cheaper phone. It can charge wirelessly, which is one of those things that doesn’t sound like much, but once you get used to having it you wonder how you ever did without it. It can also offer much more storage, with a 256GB version as well as the standard 128GB. It also has an IP86 rating for dust- and-water resistance, meaning it can withstand continued immersion in water while the Pixel 7a has to make do with IP67, and can’t. For these reasons, the Pixel 7 justifies itself as one of the best mid-range phones you can buy. It’s a close-run thing though, and the cheaper Pixel 7a is also worth consideration.

      value: 'Selling for $599/£599, the Google Pixel 7 delivers an excellent camera, tons of computational photography features and a beefy battery that can go for more than 24 hours. That kind of value can’t be argued with, but it is enough to sway devotees of iPhones or Samsung Galaxies? Joshua Waller takes a closer look to see if Google’s mid-range wonder does enough to justify itself. Google Pixel 7 at a glance: The Google Pixel 7 made its official debut in October, though anyone who pays the slightest attention to tech news would have been aware of it before then. Google did plenty of teasing in the lead-up to the launch. The Pixel 7 arrived alongside its bigger brother Pixel 7 Pro , and with a considerable difference in asking price of £300/$300, these phones shaped up to be quite different propositions. They would later be joined by the Pixel 7a , a budget-friendly offering with a completely overhauled camera system. On the inside, the Pixel 7 is powered up by Google’s Tensor G2 chip, the same processor as features in the Pixel 7 Pro. The phone uses the Android 13 operating system, and together, these two deliver a smooth user experience, one that’s a decent jump up in polish compared to the Pixel 6. It’s well and truly a phone in the middle, but the middle is an area that includes a lot of users; those who don’t want to pay flagship prices, but also don’t want the cheapest and simplest thing off the shelf. Of course, a phone isn’t just defined by its rivals and contemporaries; it needs to stand on its own as a device you’re going to want to use and enjoy using. So, for this review we’ve taken the Google Pixel 7 out to see how it performs, testing its camera capability, general operation and more.

We also have a guide to the best used smartphones if you’re looking to save some cash, as well as a breakdown of iPhone vs Android if you’re still stuck choosing between operating systems. Google Pixel 7 Features So, what does the Google Pixel 7 offer? To start with, Google took the view that rather than cram in a terrible 2MP macro lens, it would do better to focus on the pairing of the excellent main camera 50MP Octa OD Bayer wide camera, and a decent 12MP ultra-wide camera with an f/2.2 aperture. So, while it doesn’t boast the headline ‘triple-camera array’ of many contemporary smartphones, you’re arguably not missing much there. The Pixel 7 includes the controversial (or marmite like) camera bar, as well as a number of rather impressive computational photography features, that left us impressed last year in the Pixel. You may find the aluminium bar that houses the camera array to be visually offensive, an affront to your eyes. Or, you may not care. Either way, it’s clear that it’s here to stay. The Pixel 7 made a few changes from the previous year’s Pixel 6 (still a good-value phone if you can get it). Interestingly, its OLED display is actually very slightly smaller than the previous phone’s, going down from 6.4 inches to 6.3. This may sound like a downgrade, but Google is betting that the smaller screen and thinner bezels will result in a phone that’s more comfortable in the hand, while assuming that relatively few people are going to actually complain about losing 0.1 inches of display (they’re probably right there). Other improvements found in the Pixel 7 include an improved selfie camera over the Pixel 6, with the same 10.8MP unit as found in the Pixel 7 Pro, compared to the 8MP selfie camera in the Pixel 6. Unfortunately, the Pixel 7 doesn’t benefit from some of the other improvements that have been made to the 7 Pro, such as the new macro mode (thanks to the ultra-wide camera on the 7 Pro featuring AF), and the 7 has to make do with a fixed-focus ultra-wide-angle camera instead. There’s also the lack of a telephoto lens unit, instead the 7 can use “Super Res Zoom” up to 8x, although the default option of 2x is normally the best to use. In terms of other differences, the Pixel 7 has a 6.3inch screen compared to the 6.4inch screen on the Pixel 6, and the 6.7inch screen on the 7 Pro. The screen on the Pixel 6 and 7 is flat, compared to the curved edges on the more premium 7 Pro. The difference in measurements is fairly minimal, but the difference in hand is quite noticeable, and this also makes a difference if you use a case on the phone. The Pixel 7 is on sale at $349/£474 sim-free for the 8GB/128GB model, and $449/£574 for the 8GB 256GB version, which puts in firmly in the mid-range price level. The Pixel 7 Pro is currently priced at $599/$ £724 for the 128GB storage option and $699/£824 for the 256GB which is noticeably less than other premium/flagship smartphones which often hit the £1000+ price point. For that reason, the Pixel 7 Pro also offers great value for money, considering what is on offer. The selfie camera is a 10.8MP f/2.2 wide-angle (21mm equivalent) camera, which is fixed focus, and therefore
        doesn’t match the auto-focus selfie cameras on some other premium smartphones. Let’s find out if the Pixel 7 is worth the money, or if there’s something missing from the Pixel 7 compared to the 7 Pro… Google Pixel 7 Handling and Design The Pixel 7 features a non-curved 6.3inch OLED screen, with a 1080×2400 pixel resolution, and a dynamic refresh rate up to 90Hz. Colours look great on the screen, and there’s also a good level of brightness on offer, which can help with visibility out in bright sunny weather. Gorilla Glass Victus can be found at the front and back, and this is Gorilla Glass’ toughest protection currently available. An IP68 rating gives you a waterproof rating down to 1.5m for 30mins, although there is an exposed USB port, so this isn’t really recommended for regular use, without added protection. In terms of the software, the phone comes with Android 13, and you get (at least) five years of updates, as well as a 2year warranty. Google often release both feature updates, as well as security updates, so you can expect both camera improvements as well as bug fixes to come in future. Stereo speakers are included, as well as multiple microphones to ensure high audio quality both for playback and calls. The Pixel 7 feels quite svelte in the hand, particularly if you’re used to larger phones. The phone feels extremely well built, and how good the phone looks depends on what colour options you go for, with the Obsidian black looking good. I don’t think it looks as premium as the 7 Pro, but it’s not far off. If you do go for the “Snow” or Lemongrass colours, then you get a shiny silvery camera bar, which I think looks a little bit better than the dark grey of the “Obsidian” model, but your own personal preferences may differ. As with almost every other smartphone out there, I’d definitely recommend the use of a case, as this will help reduce the slippery nature of the phone. A 4355mAh battery is built-in, and offers fast wireless charging, as well as support for 30W fast charging. I had no worries about battery life when using the smartphone, and in general the phone feels extremely rapid, snappy, and responsive. Using the camera app you get a row of camera modes along the bottom, with a shutter button above this. There’s a row of lens options, which include .7, 1x, and 2, which are short for the main cameras including 0.7x (for the ultra-wide), 1x (for the main wide angle camera), and 2x using the Super Resolution Zoom. The different shooting modes available include: With more you can find ‘Panorama’, ‘Photo Sphere’ and Lens. Beyond these you get additional photo features and options in playback, when editing photos, under Tools, including the Magic eraser, Unblur, and Portrait blur. The camera also features Face Unblur and Real Tone. Night Sight – the night mode has been improved and is said to be three times faster than the previous Pixel. This can be used handheld, but when you use the camera on a solid surface or tripod, it will enable the astrophotography mode which can take much longer shots, as well as generate a timelapse video for you. The Motion mode can be used to long exposure photography, such as a blurred waterfall or river, as well as light trails. How effective this is can depend on the subject, and there is limited control over settings, but when it works it can be very impressive, especially as there is no need for a tripod or other stabilisation that you would traditionally need with cameras. The portrait mode gives you editing options that let you adjust the background blur (or bokeh), as well as add “Portrait Light” for more flattering lighting. Using the rear camera, you can shoot at 1x or 2x zoom, and when using the selfie camera, you have the option of a 0.7x wide-angle view, or 1x. Cinematic video is new with the Pixel 7 Pro and 7 and offers a “cinematic blur” to your videos, promising to keep your subject in focus, and the background blurred “for dramatic effect”. This appears to be in response to the feature that was introduced with the iPhone 13 Pro last year but can only be recorded at a resolution of FullHD, and results are generally less than impressive. Raw shooting is available, with the camera giving DNG images. If you want take images without strong HDR, then the raw files give you this option. Google Pixel 7 Image quality and performance The camera interface gives an easy-to-use system, with the majority of settings automatically controlled. If the camera detects low-light, it will automatically switch to Night sight. For those that want to take control, there are some settings you can change (such as white balance and brightness), as well as the previously mentioned raw option, but there are no manual controls available. The ultra-wide-angle camera gives good results although there is some distortion, as with most ultra-wide-angle cameras on smartphones. The corners can also show some noise, particularly when shooting in darker conditions. Colour reproduction
        is very good, and detail is respectable, although does drop off into the far corners. The wide-angle or standard camera uses an f/1.85 aperture, with PDAF (phase-detection AF), as well as Laser AF, and combined with Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) can be used for low-light shooting. Image quality from this camera is very good, with detailed and sharp images, and excellent colour reproduction. Use the telephoto option, and you can select 2x zoom, and this uses the main camera, with a crop, and Google’s “Super Res zoom” technology that takes a number of shots to improve the detail captured. You can also zoom to 8x zoom, and this uses the Super Res Zoom technology to take a number of shots, combining them to produce an image with (in theory) additional detail, and reduced noise. Whilst the images we took definitely didn’t have the jagged edges that you’d normally see with digital zoom, we didn’t see much additional detail, so it’s likely this is best avoided, however, up to 2x gives reasonable results. The Pixel 7 does not benefit from the 7 Pro’s macro mode, so this is one area where you will find it difficult to take really close up photos. Low-light performance – When shooting low-light images using Night sight, it’s impressive how quickly the camera takes the photo – in comparison to the Pixel 6/Pro shots are much quicker to take, and this helps reduce blur and movement. The selfie camera is improved over the Pixel 6, giving a nice-looking image, even in less-than-ideal light. You can adjust the level of background blur and the processing does a good job of dealing with hair the majority of the time. Standard video modes from the front and rear cameras can be recorded at up to 4K 60fps, with up to 1080p 240fps slow-motion available from the rear. There are options for 10-bit HDR video recording, as well as voice enhancement. Value for money As long as you don’t mind there being no telephoto camera and no macro mode, then the Pixel 7 is exceptional value for money, especially now as prices have fallen from their initial launch price. It is now being sold for less than the RRP if you shop around. The Pixel 7 Pro is also available at discounted prices. The 128GB version is now $599/£724 from $899/£849, and the 256GB is $699/£824 from $999/£949. In the mid-range smartphone market, there are often compromises made, with other triple camera systems offering a great main camera, alongside low-resolution ultra-wide, or telephoto cameras, sometimes with an entirely pointless 2MP macro camera. So it’s nice to see the Pixel 7 offering 2 great rear cameras, and a good selfie camera. Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G 128GB at $600/£699 (12MP ultra-wide, 12MP main, and 8MP telephoto, 32MP selfie), the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G $500/£649 (50MP ultra-wide, 32MP front camera, 8MP telephoto camera) and the Oppo Reno8 Pro $540/$/£499 (50MP wide, 8MP ultra-wide, and 2MP macro rear camera, 32MP front camera)'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The Sony Xperia 10 V offers quite a nice set of features, considering the price. The camera app includes a night mode, auto HDR, and a background blur feature, but it would be nice to see additional shooting modes. It feels like Sony are still playing catch up in the mobile phone market, as Apple, Samsung, Google, and others, are offering additional computational shooting modes (such as long exposure). One thing that the Sony Xperia range of phones offers that seems to divide phone fans is the 21:9 aspect ratio screen. It’s rare that you find anyone who is a fan of this aspect ratio, but that doesn’t mean these people aren’t out there, somewhere. Unfortunately with the Xperia 10 V, it turns what could have been a compact smartphone, into another phone that’s difficult to use (reach), due to it being too tall. This also has the knock-on effect of making your 4:3 images look small on the screen. The smartphone market is crying out for more compact smartphones, as there are so few options available. When shooting, the preview shows you an image with poor dynamic range, but when you view the photo in playback, once you’ve waited for “Processing” to go away, you get an image with much improved dynamic range thanks to automatic HDR, the majority of the time. However, if you accidentally press the shutter button for too long, continuous shooting will be activated and then you get images with poor dynamic range. The other issue is that focus fails every now and then, so every 1 in every 30 photo I took (on average), was completely out of focus – this happened with both the main camera and the telephoto camera, but more so with the telephoto camera. Video quality is major disappointment, as the camera only records Full HD video, and doesn’t record 4K video at all. This is available on a range of competitors, even models at the same price range (or less), such as the Nothing Phone 1 . The other issue is that the video quality is lacking as detail is poor, as exposure and stabilisation struggles to keep up. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to see why anyone would choose this phone over a Samsung, Google Pixel, or any of the other brands available, as there are a number of things on this phone that simply aren’t competitive with what’s out there. However, if improvements could be made to the performance and responsiveness of the phone and cameras, then it could be a contender.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Sony Xperia range of smartphones includes a range of mostly premium models, with one entry-level model , the Sony Xperia 10 V . This phone comes with a number of things that make it sound appealing on paper, including a triple camera setup including a telephoto camera, a 5000mAh battery, and even a headphone socket, but how does it perform as a camera phone? Sony Xperia 10 V at a glance: Sony Xperia 10 V Features It’s rare for an entry-level or mid-range phone to have a triple camera setup that includes three ‘proper’ cameras. Normally mid-range phones have a dual camera setup, and if there is a third camera, it’s often a depth camera, or a low-resolution 2MP macro camera (both entirely pointless when the main camera/s can do better). So, to see a triple camera setup on a phone at this price point piqued our interest and we needed to test it. The cameras include a 48MP wide-angle main camera , with an f/1.8 aperture, PDAF (phase-detection auto focus), and optical image stabilisation (OIS). This uses pixel binning to give 12MP images. There’s an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera , with fixed focus, and an f/2.2 aperture, and a small 1/4inch sensor – this is really rather small at 3.6×2.7mm. The third rear camera is an 8MP telephoto camera that gives a 2x zoom, and a 54mm equivalent, with an f/2.2 aperture, PDAF, and no optical image stabilisation. The sensor is smaller again at 1/4.4inches. And sure, these additional cameras may not be 10 or 12MP units, but at least they’re not super low-resolution like the 2MP macro cameras we see on many entry/mid-range models. There’s an 8MP selfie camera, with fixed focus, and an f/2.0 aperture. Background defocus is available when using this camera, as well as AutoHDR, and Night shooting. The camera app The camera app that’s built-in is a “basic” camera app, and this phone doesn’t feature the multiple camera apps found on the Xperia 1 V and other premium Sony phones. This is mostly a good thing, for the intended user of this phone, as it simplifies the shooting experience. The app includes two shooting modes, either photo or video, as well as a manual mode, however, it does seem to be quite limited, as there are only a few different settings available (including night: auto/on/off), background blur (on/off and a slider control), as well as Auto HDR, Skin softening, and Object tracking in the menus. Beyond this there are three more modes, including Google Lens, Slow motion, and Panorama. And that’s it. Other phones tend to offer a background blur mode that’s labelled as a portrait mode, a macro mode, plus additional shooting modes like creative  long exposure modes (as found on the Google Pixel range and others). Using the camera app can be quite a slow experience, as it always seems like you’re waiting for the camera to take a photo when you press the on-screen shutter release. It also doesn’t show you a preview of what the image will look like, as it does the processing after you’ve taken the photo. Once you do go and view the photo, you can be waiting quite a while for the image to be processed. Design and Handling The most obvious design feature of the Sony Xperia 10 V is the 21:9 aspect ratio screen which makes it a tall and thin phone compared to others. This can make it a little difficult to reach the tops of the screen, as it’s a similar height to other phones with larger screens. Whether you like this or not will be down to personal preference. Stereo speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack are a nice touch, and the phone offers an IP65 / IP68 rating. A 5000mAh battery , and Sony’s excellent battery management mean that this phone can last a long time before needing charging, particularly when you’re not using it. The phone doesn’t support wireless charging. The fingerprint sensor is on the side of the phone and is part of the power button. Double click the power button and you can quickly open the camera mode. Build quality is generally good, and for the price there is nothing to complain about, and support for MicroSD cards is a nice feature. General performance is a little bit sluggish, so scrolling through apps, settings and switching between web pages and the home screen can feel a little slow. It’s a little bit disappointing, as other mid-range smartphones don’t feel this sluggish. The phone is available in a range of colours including white, black, sage green and lavender. Sony Xperia 10 V Performance The wide-angle, main camera gives good results, and in good light, images can look really nice. However, there were other times when it got it completely wrong, with images poorly focused, lacking detail, lacking dynamic range, and looking entirely terrible in comparison to the nearest competitor (the Samsung Galaxy A54 ). Colours could easily be overly saturated, or over-exposed, meaning detail disappeared, and multiple shots were needed so that we could pick the one image that worked the best. Images also don’t look very good on the screen when you’re
        taking them, and you have to wait for the phone to process the photos before you know if the shot has worked or not. The main camera supports hybrid zoom, up to 10x using “AI Super Resolution Zoom” and this could be a potential replacement for the telephoto camera, and does make us wonder a bit why the telephoto camera isn’t a 3x unit. Ultra-wide-angle – In bright conditions, the results can be quite good looking. However, in darker areas, even when shooting in daylight, noise can become an ugly addition to the images, and purple fringing is noticeable. There were times when the colour reproduction from this camera was widely different from the main camera. The telephoto camera gives good results in bright conditions, but exposure can be inconsistent, so it can take a number of shots before you get the result you want. Focus, at times, would completely fail, producing a photo that was completely out of focus. The 2x telephoto camera does give *slightly* better results than a standard 2x digital zoom on a phone like the Samsung Galaxy A54, however, it would be even better if this was a 3x telephoto camera, as that would give it a definite edge over 2x digital zoom. Google’s Pixel phones for example do a great job of 2x digital zoom using super resolution technology, and it’s possible, that Sony’s own technology could have given similar results using the main camera. Having a 3x telephoto would have given it an extra edge. Close-up performance of the main camera is relatively good, and whilst the phone doesn’t have a dedicated macro mode, it does allow close enough focus for some close-up shots. In low-light, noise reduction is so strong that images lack detail, and images look blurry, and disappointing. If you view them smaller, then they look okay, from a distance. The 8MP selfie camera has fixed focus, and does a reasonable job most of the time. Background defocus is available, but dynamic range can struggle, and detail is relatively low. Video performance Video stabilisation is not up to the same standard as other smartphones, and when it struggles, video is very jerky. The quality and detail in video are relatively low, and whilst colour was reasonable, exposure was a little off, looking exposed. Value for Money The Sony Xperia 10 V is available for $449 / £399, which puts it up against some quite impressive competition. For example, the 6.1inch Google Pixel 7a (at $449 / £449) has a dual camera system, and Super Resolution Technology means you can easily get similar 2x photos. Then there’s the Samsung Galaxy A54 (at $449 / £449), with the same height (155mm vs 158.2mm), but a wider 6.4inch screen and all-round better camera experience, as well as up to 5 years of updates. Another option is the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro + (with 200MP main camera). Both the Google Pixel 7a and Samsung Galaxy A54 produce better photos than the Xperia 10 V, and there are also cheaper options available as well, including the Google Pixel 6a , and Nothing Phone 1 , which have both seen reductions recently.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: If you want a high-end phone, most people tend to gravitate towards the well-known names in the smartphone market, i.e. Samsung and Apple. But phones like this show that there’s devices out there which are just as good – if not better – than their bigger named, bigger budget rivals. Image quality from the Honor Magic 5 is excellent and easily rivals the Samsung, iPhone and other competitors such as the Pixel 7 Pro. It performs well in a variety of situations, including low light. There are just a couple of niggles here that stop it short of being five star, the lack of 8K video (probably not a deal breaker for most, but we need to differentiate it somehow from other similar offerings), and the fact that Portrait mode is a little bit unrealistic looking compared with others. Otherwise, this is a fantastic option for those that want high-end technology in a (slightly) more reasonably priced smartphone. If your budget is even tighter, you can still look towards the likes of Google or OnePlus, but the Honor Magic 5 Pro is a great choice for many.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Honor Magic 5 Pro has the potential to put value smartphone brand Honor on the premium map, with high quality specifications that rival some of the top phones on the market right now. But how does it really fair? Honor Magic 5 Pro at a glance: Honor Magic 5 Pro features: At one time, Honor was the “value” smartphone brand of the once-mighty Huawei. Now a separate entity in its own right, it seems to be producing smartphones which rival its old owners in terms of quality and performance. The Honor Magic 5, for example, launched in March 2023 is currently sitting in the top three spot for DxO Mark’s smartphone rankings. This puts it significantly above the likes of big-name smartphones currently on the market including the Samsung S23 Ultra (#14), the iPhone 14 Pro (#8) and the Google Pixel 7 Pro (#6). On paper at least, it’s not hard to see why the Honor Magic 5 Pro is particularly appealing. It includes a triple-lens array which is backed by not one, not two, but three high-resolution megapixel sensors – something which is rare to find in smartphone world (it’s seen elsewhere in the Xiaomi 12 Pro , but the bigger household names don’t tend to follow suit here). You get a standard (23mm), ultrawide (13mm) and a telephoto lens (90mm) , alongside digital zooming capability which goes all the way up to 100x – just as we’ve seen on the Samsung S23 Ultra. You get all of this in a smartphone which can be picked up for $1099 / £949, which although not cheap is well priced against the S23 Ultra and the iPhone 14 Pro (though it is more expensive than the Pixel 7 Pro). Video functions are fairly standard, with 4K and Full HD options – 8K options as seen in the Samsung S23 and S23 Ultra is missing, but that’s unlikely to be a deal breaker for most. Other useful features here include a 5100 mAh battery, 512GB memory, and a 6.8-inch 2848×1312 OLED screen . A 66W “Supercharger” is included in the box – a relative rarity these days – which gives quick power bursts, while wireless charging is also available. Honor Magic 5 Pro handling and design: With its 6.8” screen, the Magic 5 is on the large side for a smartphone, putting it in line with the likes of the Samsung S23 Ultra and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Whether you like large phones or not is largely down to preference, but it’s harder to use it one handed than a smaller device. The upside is that your photos and videos look great with all that space available. Size aside, the device itself is very sleek, with rounded edges. There’s three colour ways to choose between – we had the ultra-shiny black version, but the green and purple options have a pleasingly matte finish which are also quite aesthetically pleasing. The display is called a “ quad-curved floating screen ”, which means almost all of the phone size is taken up with the display, apart from a small cut out for the selfie camera. At the back of the phone is a protruding circular housing for the three cameras. It looks a bit odd compared to most other smartphones on the market, but it’s an interesting design choice none-the-less. As is fairly standard for phones at this price point, it has IP68 water and dust resistance. The phone has a glass front, but it’s not specified if this has any additional protection – we might reasonably assume it’s not as tough as models out there which are using things like Corning Gorilla Glass for extra protection, but it’s managed to stay damage free during our time with it at least after being carried in pockets and in bags. Honor Magic 5 Pro native camera app: Similarly to plenty of other Android models, the Honor Magic 5 Pro has an extensive native camera app, which is appealing to both those who just want to let the phone get on with it and those who want to take a greater degree of control. The default shooting mode is Photo, which is what we expect you’ll use for most of your shots. Here you can take pictures using all three of the lenses, plus zoom in to either 10x or 100x digitally (and stops in between). Along the top of the screen you’ll see some extra options, such as switching on “AI” for advanced scene recognition and adjustments , the ability to switch on a flash and a range of interesting digital filters. A set of more extensive changes to settings can be made by tapping on a cog icon. An interesting feature that can be activated in the standard Photo mode is “Motion Sensing Capture”. Here, the phone promises to automatically detect and capture movement, as you might expect from the name. In practice this is a little hit and miss – it worked well capturing a jogger but refused to acknowledge my dog’s movements running towards the phone (despite specifically referencing dogs and cats in the ‘about’ dialogue box). It feels like a bit of a gimmick that most people probably won’t have too much use for – it might be quite good for capturing things like sports days and so on (though I wouldn’t rely on it in case it failed). A Portrait mode gives you the option
        to shoot at either 1x or 2x depending on how much of the scene you want to include in your portrait shot. It works with non-human subjects, and you can adjust the strength of the bokeh depending on your preference too. You can also switch on “Beauty” to smooth skin and so on. A Night mode is available for shooting in low light, though you should find this automatically activates if the camera detects an absence of light anyway. With this mode you can shoot with any of the three lenses, as well as use digital zoom. An “aperture” mode works in much the same way as portrait mode, only you get more direct control over the simulated aperture – you can only use one focal length though. For those that want extra control, a Pro mode gives you the option to change metering, ISO, shutter speed, exposure compensation, focusing and white balance. With this mode, you can also shoot in raw format too if you like. A set of extra shooting modes can be found under a “More” tab, including a High Resolution option for accessing the full 50 megapixels of each camera (otherwise images are output at 12 megapixels by default). There’s also a Super Macro mode , although again this should automatically activate in standard Photo mode by moving close to a subject anyway. There is a specific video mode, with a range of video options available including 4K, HDR 10+ and Magic Take (whereby the phone can identify highlight moments to generate short videos or recommend featured photos. You’ll need to be in movie mode to record video, since holding down the shutter button in Photo mode instead activates burst mode. Honor Magic 5 Pro image quality and performance: The Honor Magic 5 Pro is very capable of taking excellent photos in a variety of different situations, with the most impressive performance coming from the main sensor and when shooting in good light. An overall impression of detail is great here, particularly when viewing at normal print sizes and screen sizes and especially when viewing them on a great screen like the Honor Magic 5 Pro’s. That said, both the ultra wide and the telephoto also produce great shots too. The ultra wide doesn’t create too much distortion, while the 3.5x zoom offered by the telephoto allows you to get a good amount closer to the subject. Digital zoom is also well worth using, up to a point. The 10x and 30x options produce good results, but as we usually find, the 100x option is really more of a marketing gimmick than something anybody would use in all seriousness. Colours are vibrant and bold, but also remain on the realistic side, even when engaging the “AI” mode, which can often leave you with bafflingly bright cyan skies and the like – not the case here, which keeps things looking very pleasant. Tones are also extremely well matched between the three lenses, so you can take the same view with all three and enjoy uniformity. 100x digital zoom on Honor Magic 5 Pro. Photo: Amy Davies In low light / night mode, as is usually the case, the 1x lens creates the best results, but the ultra wide doesn’t do too bad a job either. If you select 3.5x, you’ll likely find that it’s actually the 1x lens which is activated and then cropped in – but with 50 megapixels available, this isn’t a bad thing, so even the telephoto option in low light produces very usable results. Portrait mode puts in a reasonable job, though it’s quite obviously “fake” around hair outlines and such, especially if you’re looking at the images on a computer screen. It’s less of an issue at normal phone sizes, but we have seen better Portrait modes from other models before – particularly the iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung S23 Ultra and Pixel 7 Pro, which seem to produce more “natural” looking results. Super macro allows you to get nice and close to the subject, and is good to see it on a phone like this – some flagships not having this option is a real disappointment. Detail in macro mode is nicely rendered. Video options do a good job of producing reasonably smooth, steady and well-detailed video. Being able to zoom while using all resolutions / frame rates is great. Serious vloggers may perhaps be disappointed by a lack of an 8K mode, but it’s probably true that relatively few “ordinary” users would bother with this anyway. Not having an advanced stabilisation mode is also something which may put off vloggers too, which is something to think about too if that applies to you. Honor Magic 5 Pro value for money: How you view this phone’s affordability depends on a variety of factors. Nobody is suggesting it’s a cheap phone, but considering the number of high-end specifications it’s got – putting it on par with the likes of the iPhones and the Samsungs of this world – it’s priced reasonably well. Honor only makes this available in one memory option (512GB) so there’s no option to trade a little bit of memory for a cheaper price, and if you prefer a smaller device, you’re out of luck if you want the Magic 5 Pro.'

      value: Does the Samsung Galaxy A54 manage to impress? Sitting in the budget to mid-range phone market, how does it perform? Joshua Waller finds out.
    - type: conclusion
      value: The Samsung Galaxy A54 is in the somewhat awkward, and definitely overcrowded, mid-range smartphone market. Offer too much and you end up competing with other Samsung phones, yet offer too little, and you don’t look competitive compared to other brands. Around this price point, there is some real competition, including from Samsung’s own S-series from last year – with the Samsung Galaxy S22 being a serious contender at roughly the same price as the A54.  There’s also the Google Pixel 7A , which as some seriously impressive photography features. However, both of these have smaller screens, and smaller batteries. If you don’t want a smaller screen, then there are other options, such as the Nothing Phone 1 , which is cheaper, but doesn’t offer a third camera. Or you could look at smartphones from Xiaomi, in the form of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ , and Xiaomi 12T Pro , as both offer a whopping 200MP main camera. However, when you look at the other cameras bundled with these, they look less impressive.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'It stands to reason that companies like Samsung actually sell a whole lot more mid-range and budget smartphones compared to premium flagship phones. Not everyone has a spare $1000 / £1000 to buy a premium phone, and many won’t want to pay out for expensive monthly subscriptions. That’s where the Samsung Galaxy A54 fits in, available for less than $450 / £450 new, how does it perform? At a glance: Samsung Galaxy A54 Features, Handling and Design The main camera on the Samsung A54 is a wide-angle 50MP f/1.8 camera , with a Quad Bayer sensor, PDAF (Phase-detection auto-focus) and optical image stabilisation (OIS). The Quad Bayer sensor gives 12.5MP images as it uses pixel binning to combine 4 pixels into 1. The other cameras on the back are less impressive, but still better than many other mid-range smartphones, as there is a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle camera with fixed focus. The third camera is a macro camera, again with fixed focus, but at least this is a 5MP camera , rather than the completely pointless 2MP macro cameras found on some models. We would have preferred the third camera to be a telephoto camera, but you can’t always get exactly what you want. The front facing camera is a 32MP f/2.2 camera , and using a Quad Bayer sensor, this gives you 8MP images as it combines 4-pixels into one. The design used for the protruding cameras on the back mean that it’s very easy for these to be dust-magnets , with dust quickly surrounding the camera lenses, and it’s particularly difficult to remove. It’s surprising, to me anyway, that Samsung has gone for this design on the Samsung Galaxy S23 range as well as the A54, when the earlier design looked much neater, and were easier to clean (on the S22 and A53 respectively). The camera app The camera app defaults to the “Photo” mode, and gives you the choice of 0.5x, 1x, and 2x cameras, with the 2x camera using digital zoom. However, one difference from some of the flagship Samsung phones we review, in that it’s got a “FUN” photo mode , with filters from Snapchat. This works best with people as the subject, but is available for the rear cameras as well as the selfie camera. Once you’ve taken images using this effect, the original (unedited) photo is lost forever, so we wouldn’t recommend using this mode for anything important. There is the usual portrait, photo, and video modes as expected, and inside the MORE section you’ll find additional shooting modes including PRO, PRO Video, Night, Food, and others including the Macro mode, which you need to use to access the dedicated macro camera. You can edit the camera app setup, so you could move the Macro mode (or your favourite modes) onto the main screen for quicker access. The portrait mode has a slider to let you adjust the strength of the effect, and this increase/decreases the amount of background blur. This is available for both the rear camera, and the selfie camera. Whilst it’s nice to see some additional shooting modes, such as this Fun filters mode, it’d be nice to see some more shooting modes dedicated to photography, such as the motion modes on many of the competitors, as these allow for creative shooting of light-trails or waterfalls. Design Features There are stereo speakers, but no headphone socket, and a USB Type-C connection can be found at the bottom. There’s support for both face-unlock, and a fingerprint sensor under the screen making it quick and easy to unlock the phone when needed. Gorilla Glass 5 protects the 6.4inch screen, and also protects the back of the phone. The screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, and is an AMOLED screen, which means you can switch on an always-on display if needed. With a glass front and back, the phone can be a bit slippery, so a grippy case is recommended. There’s an IP67 rating, meaning it should survive a quick dunk in water without too much worry. If you do need to upgrade the memory on this phone, then you’ll find it has a MicroSD card slot. The battery is rated at 5000mAh which is generous for a mid-range phone. The phone doesn’t support wireless charging, and if that’s what you’re looking for then the Samsung Galaxy S22 is a very similar price right now. Samsung Galaxy A54 Performance The Samsung Galaxy A54, like other Samsung smartphones, gives good colour reproduction , and generally consistent results between the different camera modules on the phone. Automatic HDR shooting means that dynamic range captured is good, and most of the time this gives good results without being too over the top. This means images look more life-like than the results produced by some phones. There are good levels of saturation, although occasionally saturation can be a little too rich. The main wide-angle camera gives the best results, with an f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS) helping in low-light conditions. The lens is equivalent to 23mm which is relatively wide-angle for a main camera. Noise levels are well-controlled, even when shooting in low-light conditions.
        In low-light the main wide-angle camera gives the best results, thanks to OIS, and good image processing dealing well with noise. When looking at images from the ultra-wide-angle camera , you can spot a slight drop in image quality, as well as a slight difference in colour, when comparing the same scene taken with the main camera. However, results should still be good enough for most people, and we’ve definitely seen worse ultra-wide-angle shots from other mid-range phones. The dedicated 5MP macro camera has a fixed focus and recommends shooting with the subject 3-5cm away from the camera. This means you can get close-up photos of things, as long as the subject or object is the right size for your framing, as anything outside of this will be out of focus, so larger items are best photographed with the main camera. Results are reasonably good, and if you plan on sharing images on social media then 5MP will be plenty. You can also use the 2x option on the main camera, as this has a reasonable close-focus distance. We much prefer it when the camera uses the main camera, or ultra-wide-angle camera for macro photography , as being able to have auto-focus is much more useful, as not every small thing is the same size. Samsung could have added a macro mode by simply using an ultra-wide-angle camera with auto-focus, like many other phones have. This would have also given the added benefit of higher resolution macro photos, as well as potentially freeing up space for a telephoto camera rather than a low-resolution macro camera.. The selfie camera (or front facing camera) on the A54 gives you 8MP pixel-binned images from the 32MP quad-bayer sensor camera. Results are reasonable, and the background blur effect works well. As the focus is fixed, it’ll be important to make sure you and your friends (assuming you have them) are the right distance otherwise focus won’t be perfect. If you wanted a smartphone with a selfie camera that features auto-focus, Samsung’s S-series are getting more affordable as time goes on, and the Samsung Galaxy S22 is currently a very similar price to the A54. Video recording Video recording maxes out at 4K and 30fps on the main camera, and the selfie camera. In comparison the Pixel 7A offers 4K 60p from the main camera, and 4K 30p from the selfie camera. If you use the selfie camera for video, focus is fixed. Other video modes include super slow-mo, slow motion and hyperlapse recording. Value for money The Samsung Galaxy A54 is available for under $450 / £450, however it’s up against some stiff competitions from the likes of the Google Pixel 7A (6.1inch, £449), Redmi Note 12 Pro+ (6.67inch, £449), Nothing Phone 1 (6.5inch, £379), and even the Samsung Galaxy S22 (6.1inch, around £450). The Samsung Galaxy A54 offers a rich selection of cameras, with a 50MP main camera, 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP macro camera. If that 5MP macro, large screen, and 5000mAh battery appeals to you, then it might be the factor that makes the A54 the choice for you.'

      value: Skylum’s Luminar Neo uses AI to make editing images simple, but it also has a wealth of easy-to-use controls. Angela Nicholson takes a look.
    - type: conclusion
      value: 'While the impact of the Presets and some of the AI-powered tools can be a hard to predict, I enjoy using Luminar Neo and it’s capable of producing some great results. The Presets can produce attractive-looking images by themselves, but it’s good to be able to tweak the final image and apply additional edits using the Tools. However, it’s important to remember that the order in which the tools are applied affects the end result. Turn an image black and white, for example, and then add a blue sky, and you’ll have to revisit the black and white conversion controls to take the colour from the sky. In the early stages of using Luminar Neo, you’re likely to spend time investigating the impact of the Presets and Tools, but they are easy to apply and their impact can be removed quickly if they don’t work for you. After a while you’ll find those that you like and you can create your own Presets for future use. Unsurprisingly, Skylum pushes the subscription model for purchasing Luminar Neo and it can be hard to find the one-off purchase option. There’s also an option to buy ‘X Membership Premium’ for £54 year. This gives you access to educational materials, an exclusive community and extra skies, Presets, LUTs and overlays. This, plus the selling of extra presets and skies within the software can give something of a marketplace experience, but Luminar Neo has lots of functionality, you can create your own presets and add your own skies, so you may not need anything else.

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Skylum Luminar Neo is available to purchase with a one-time payment or as a subscription, but how does this photo editing software stack up? Skylum Luminar NEO at a glance: Skylum developed Luminar Neo from the ground up to be different from previous Luminar editors like Luminar 4 and Luminar AI . It has all the Luminar AI tools and a very similar layout, but there are additional features and more ‘state-of-the-art technologies’. Unlike previous editions of Luminar, Luminar Neo has a modular engine and this enables faster image processing. The one-time purchase includes Luminar Neo and all the maintenance and feature updates delivered for this software version (but not future versions). It can be expanded by purchasing ‘Extensions’. Alternatively, a Pro subscription which costs $89 / £89 a year brings the Luminar Neo software and all future updates and versions, plus all the extensions released during the subscription period. It’s worth keeping an eye on the Skylum website as there are frequent discounts and best deals. Standalone or plugin Luminar Neo can operate as a standalone package for working non-destructively on JPEGs or raw files or as a plugin for Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom Classic and Photos for Mac OS. In this review, I’ve focused on using Luminar Neo as a standalone package, but it’s easy to access the same tools from within the host software. With an image open in Photoshop you just need to select Filter > Skylum Software > Luminar Neo, in the Develop module of Lightroom select File > Plug-in Extras > Transfer to Luminar Neo, and in Apple Photos the route is Edit > Extensions > Luminar Neo. Extensions Skylum has committed to developing Luminar Neo into a comprehensive creative editing package and it is expanding its functionality with ‘Extensions’. These include HDR Merge, Upscale AI, AI Background Removal, Noiseless AI, Supersharp AI and Focus Stacking Extensions. This review concentrates on the main software and doesn’t look at the Extensions. Number of devices Getting started As usual when you launch an image-editing software package, the first step in using Luminar Neo is to open an image. Luminar Neo has a catalog section. It works with your computer’s filing structure, and you don’t have to actually import images into it. You just need to let it know which folders you are interested in working with. It’s also possible to work on individual images using the ‘Add Image’ button in the top left corner of the page to locate the file. The catalogue is really just a file browser, but it comes with the ability to create albums. These are virtual collections of images that can be gathered together from a number of folders. The images aren’t copied or relocated. Luminar Neo just holds the location data and enables you to see all the images in a particular album on the same screen. It’s a handy function. Double-clicking on an image in the catalog enlarges it so that it fills the frame. Clicking once on the larger view zooms you into 100%. Double-clicking again returns you to the browser view. To start editing an image, you need to select it in the catalog. Then click on either ‘Presets’ or ‘Edit’ at the top of the screen. Presets makes a great starting point as they enable a number of adjustments to be applied with one click. As soon as you select ‘Presets’, Luminar Neo suggests a few Preset Collections that it considers appropriate for the image. These are shown at the top of the column on the right of the screen. Below it, you’ll see a host of other Preset Collections that you can use and that are included with the software. You are also able to buy others by clicking on the ‘Add’ button. Each of the Preset Collections contains a number of Presets that you can apply with a single click. For example, the Nature Preset Collection has six presets called ‘Newt Noir’, ‘Sunny Small’, ‘MicroWorld’, ‘Distinctive Drops’, ‘Best Close up’ and ‘Arctic Atoms’. Clicking on each one in turn allows you to see their impact. When working on a 2019 8-Core Intel Core i9 iMac and editing 61MP raw files from the Sony Alpha A7R IV , I experienced a couple of seconds lag between selecting a Preset and its effect being visible. If you particularly like a Preset, it’s worth clicking on the heart next to its name so that it’s added as a favourite. You can remove effect of the preset by clicking on the curved arrow next to its name in the column on the right or by selecting ‘Revert to Original’ in the Actions dropdown list at the bottom of the screen. After a Preset has been applied, you can tweak its impact by clicking on ‘Edit’ to access the controls. In the ‘Edits’ column, Luminar Neo automatically reveals the adjustments that have been applied to an image by a Preset. You can adjust the sliding control settings in the column on the right as you wish. The uppermost and most recently applied Edit is ‘expanded’ to reveal the sliders, but you can click on others below it to reveal and adjust their settings.
        Something to bear in mind when adjusting a Preset using the applied Edits controls is that when you click on a control, the image reverts to that point in the history of the Preset editing process. For example, after applying a black and white preset, I was presented with a list of Edits controls, running from Film Grain at the top to Black & White, Supercontrast, Color, Enhance, Structure, Face AI and Skin AI, with skin AI at the bottom as it was the first edit applied. Clicking on Supercontrast, which was applied before the Black & White conversion was made, reverts the image to colour. However, after you’ve made the Supercontrast or any other earlier Edits are adjusted, you can return the image to monochrome with the new edits by clicking on the top Edit, in this case Film Grain. There’s a ‘Tools’ tab alongside the Edits tab and clicking on that reveals a whole host of additional tools which also have sliding controls. These are grouped into ‘Favourites’, ‘Extensions’, ‘Essentials’, ‘Creative’, ‘Portrait’ and ‘Professional’ and there’s a more comprehensive list than you’ll find in the Edits section. The Essentials section has tools such as Develop Raw (with the typical controls you’d expect to adjust a raw file), Enhance AI, Erase, Structure AI, Colour, Black & White Denoise and more. Basically, it has the tools to enable exposure, contrast, colour and sharpness of an image to be adjusted. The Creative section, however, has options such as Relight AI, Sky AI, Atmosphere AI, Sunrays and more. These tools enable you to make some dramatic edits to images, significantly changing their mood. They can be very effective and are easy to use, but they’re not suitable for use if you’re planning to enter an image into competitions like the Landscape Photographer of the Year. Four of the five tools in the Portrait section use AI to help you improve the appearance of photographs of people. They generally work well, but their impact isn’t entirely predictable. The automatic Skin defects Removal tool, for example, removed one freckle on a models face but left another nearby in place. Before you start work on an image, it’s advisable to right click on the image thumbnail in the Layers column on the left of the screen and select ‘Duplicate Layer’, so you’re not working on your original image. As well as duplicating, deleting or hiding a layer, Luminar Neo allows you to add new layers to your image. There are four layer collections with a selection of flare, light leak, sparkle and bokeh effects that you can apply, but selecting the ‘Load Image’ option allows you to create a layer from another of your images. If you choose this option, Luminar opens a standard file browser rather than the catalog. It’s a good idea to know which image you want to add in advance. The new layer is added with 50% opacity by default so that you can see the layer(s) beneath, but you can adjust the opacity to suit. Each of the Edit and Tool adjustments can be applied with a mask. The mask can be applied as a brush, a linear gradient, a radial gradient or using AI. Whichever method you select, the effect of the adjustments disappears at first and reappears where you apply the mask. There’s also an eraser to remove the mask. If you use the brush to paint in the effect, you’ll find you have controls to adjust the size and softness of the brush along with a third slider that allows you to set the strength of the effect. The Strength slider adjusts the visibility of the edit from that point onwards. It doesn’t impact upon the area you have already painted. However, you can adjust the opacity of the layer using the Layer Properties control. When you’re finished, hitting the return key and selecting Tool you were previously using again to make further edits if you wish. Replacing a sky Sky AI is one of the most impressive aspects of Luminar Neo. It enables you to replace a dull sky with just a few clicks. The software does a remarkably good job of blending the sky into the foreground, even coping with lots of leaves and twigs reaching into the sky. If you swap a bright overcast sky for an intense sunset, it’s likely to look a little strange around complex areas with fine detail, but there are other skies to choose from that may fit the scene better, or you can upload your own. Alternatively, duplicating the image layer and using Sky AI to replace the sky in the duplicate before knocking back the opacity a little produces a much more natural effect. With your sky selected and applied, you then have the opportunity to move it up or down, left or right, or flip it horizontally. It’s also possible to soften the sky, which is handy if you’ve shot your subject with a wide aperture, and you can add a reflection of the sky to any water in the scene. There are also controls that let you adjust the rest of the image so that it matches the colour of the sky more closely. As with all of the Tools and Edits, it’s possible to create a mask of the sky and paint
        on it using a brush or one of the gradient tools. In most instances, I found this unnecessary as the software does a great job of recognising the sky. But it can be helpful when there are areas of uniform tone in the non-sky areas that cause confusion.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Adobe Photoshop continues to go from strength to strength and, in my view, it remains the most powerful image editing software around. Indeed, it has more features than most photographers need and there are plenty of excellent and powerful software available for those who prefer not to give their business to Adobe. See here for our guide to the best subscription-free photo editing tools All that said, $9.99/£9.98 a month for both Photoshop and Lightroom remain excellent value and a relatively small outlay for what you get. Lightroom is one of the best programs around for developing an efficient photo-editing workflow and its editing skills are only getting better. Meanwhile, Photoshop has incredible potential with its huge feature set that goes way beyond satisfying the needs of photographers. The subscription model might not suit everyone, but getting the combined power of both Photoshop and Lightroom at a reasonable monthly outlay is a huge asset for all serious photographers.

      value: 'Adobe Photoshop 24.3 at a glance: In the context of digital imaging, Adobe Photoshop has around for a very long time. Developed in 1987 and sold to Adobe in 1988, Photoshop soon became an integral app to many industries and the leading app for photographers as computers got more and more powerful and digital imaging evolved. Adobe added Photoshop to its Creative Suite and renamed it Photoshop CS in 2003. Its non-destructive editing power continued to be improved notably its compositing and selection skills. In 2013 Adobe introduced its Creative Cloud subscription service and announced that Photoshop would no longer be available as an outright purchase. It’s fair that this move was not universally welcome, but 10 years later the CC subscription is still going strong. A major benefit of subscription is the fact that you always have the latest software at your disposal and Photoshop is regularly updated to support the latest cameras, iron out bugs, have performance enhancements and new features added. Many subscribers access the program along with Adobe Lightroom as part of the Photography package – check out its recent Denoise AI updates , which are particularly welcome. Less experienced readers might also wish to try out the more beginner friendly Photoshop Elements and alternatively, If you’d rather not pay a subscription, check out our guides to the best subscription-free photo editing programs) This review was done on a M1 Mac Mini using Photoshop v24.3 which was introduced in March 2023. This review includes some of the features introduced at various times over the past year. Highlights include the choice of Device or Cloud mode for Select Subject processing in August 2022 while in October we got automatic selections on hover, improvements to the Object Selection tool and the chance to share comments and collaborate with colleagues and clients. We’ve seen various neural filters too, including Landscape Mixer, Super Zoom and the Photo Restoration filter. Adobe Photoshop: Share it Share for Review is a Photoshop innovation that means you can share images and ask for comment without having to leave the app. How useful this feature is depends on what you do and how you like to work. It has time-saving potential for professionals double-checking that their work suits their clients or perhaps for an editorial team ensuring that the pictures match the words. However, it is one of those features many enthusiast photographers might not appreciate initially, but use it a few times and they might wonder how they managed without it. For enthusiasts, being able to quickly elicit an opinion on their work from their mentor, friends or camera club members is potentially invaluable. Feedback goes straight into the Comments window in Photoshop. Go to Windows>Comments to have this feature working. To share an image, click on the Share button or use File>Edit>Share For Review, create a link which takes a few seconds and then you can invite people by email or share the created link on social media. Recipients do not need to be Adobe CC subscribers or to have Photoshop. The latest update in the Share For Review workflow is the option of setting a password to limit access to your public review links. You can take the Share For Review feature further and actually send an image for colleagues, clients or fellow photographers to edit. Go to File>Invite to Edit and the image is uploaded to the Creative Cloud and a link is created and shared in the same way as Share for Review. The recipient can now work on the image in Photoshop and either save it or download it onto their system. Only one person at a time can edit the shared image so if you have the image still open they will get a warning message but they can download a copy. Adobe Photoshop 24.3: Object Selection tool Photoshop had powerful selection and masking tools from early on and cleaning up images and image compositing have always been key benefits of the software. Adobe has continued developing and refining its tools to make selections and masks more accurate and easier to use and added popular features including Sky Replacement and Content-Aware Fill. In recent times, Adobe has enhanced Lightroom by giving it impressive masking and selection tools making it perfectly feasible to produce excellent results. However, Photoshop and its advanced features deliver more accurate, even more controllable results. The Object Selection tool ( short cut key W ) is designed to speed up selection workflows. It first arrived in v21 and has seen various improvements since. Among them, in v23.4 preserving hair details was added; in v23.5 Select Subject Cloud offered finer selections; and in v24.2 there was improved object detection and refinement. To select an object automatically tick the Object Finder box but before you hit Select Subject there are two options to consider: Device for speed or Cloud for more detailed results. Whichever method you use, the software does the
        work and you’ll see the familiar ‘marching ants’ around the detected object. Cloud does take literally a few seconds longer and on my test images this mode proved more accurate so is worth using. If you don’t tick the Object Finder box, there is the choice of Rectangle or Lasso modes that you can drag around your target to make the selection. Selections be modified in the Object Selection tool with the Options bar or use one of Photoshop’s other selection tools. Use the Shift key while using the tool to add to a selection or Alt (Mac)/Option (Windows) to subtract. The selection can be further tweaked using the Select and Mask workspace in the Object Selection toolbar. Here you can use either Color Aware or Content Aware and then edge detection and other tools to fine-tune selections. Right-clicking on the image brings yet more options including Content-Aware Fill and Delete and Fill Selection, feather and selection inverse. Adobe Photoshop 24.3: clean up your images quickly The Object Detection tool can also remove unwanted clutter from your pictures quickly by drawing the lasso or rectangle across the object you want to remove, and the software then makes its selection. With selections you usually have to modify or feather the selection to avoid hard edges. Using this tool, Photoshop applies selection modifications automatically. I tried the tool on a range of images. On this portrait shot at the Brighton Pride Festival, the streetlamp lurking in the background spoilt the composition. Removing the offending lamp can be done using the Clone Stamp tool but I thought it would be a good test for the Object Detection tool. With the Object selection tool active I used the lasso selection mode and drew a rough outline around the streetlamp. I did try the rectangle mode and that picked up the shoulder and more of the hair. Once selected with the lasso tool I hit Shift and the Delete key and Photoshop did the rest, replacing the lamp with sky. The result is good though not perfect but I didn’t expect that because I knew the strands of hair would be an issue. Nevertheless, it is pretty good result even when examined using the magnified view as shown above. Adobe Photoshop 24.3: Photo Restoration neural filter, beta version Photo Restoration is a new Neural filter launched in Photoshop v24.0. Go to Filters>Neural Filters and download the beta Photo Restoration filter. Open your target image, go to Filters>Neural Filters and click on the Photo Restoration filter’s switch. To test the filter, I used several old family snapshots that I had digitised using a flatbed scanner. I tried the Photo Restoration filter with various settings and the process took around a minute on a 15x10cm at 300ppi TIF file. The default settings are Photo Enhancement slider at 50, Enhance Face at 60 and Scratch Reduction at 0 and these do a fine job, but I couldn’t resist experimenting with the sliders. Scratch Reduction was definitely worth using and tidied up the old print well without looking too false. A setting within the range of 20-60 seemed best. Regarding the other two sliders, I found the best results were not too far from the defaults, ie the Photo Enhancement slider within the range of 50-80 and Enhance Face at 60-80. Most people will have old family snapshots in a shoebox somewhere and many will be organised and have the most valuable prints digitised ready to clean up. Of course, repairing images takes time so Photoshop’s restoration filter will help you tidy up your precious snapshots efficiently. It works well and the benefit was obvious on the old prints I tried. The trick, as with most editing filters, is not to be aggressive with the sliders because that gives unnatural looking results, so the best advice is to take it easy. Adobe Photoshop 24.3: Super Zoom If you’re a keen nature photographer you’ll have a telephoto in your lens armoury, but it still might not be powerful enough to make a small, distant subject large in the frame. This is where having a high resolution camera is handy because you can crop into the original to produce a tighter composition without impacting too much on image quality while maintaining a useful file size, but there is a limit to how far you can do before the image starts to deteriorate. You can now get specialist software such as Topaz’s Gigapixel AI that can upsize images with minimal quality loss. Photoshop’s solution is the Super Zoom neural filter – which is no longer a beta filter – that enables image files to be magnified by up to 4x, either as a whole or zoomed in. In Photoshop, the filter is accessed via Filters>Neural filter> Super Zoom where the image can be magnified up to 4x. The filter has two ways of working. The image can be outputted as a new document, so the entire image is enlarged by the selected zoom ratio, or in layer mode where the magnified image sits as a new layer. For this test I used an image of a greenfinch shot on the Canon EOS R5 at ISO 12,800. I started with
        layer mode and zoomed into the image by 2x and 4x where processing time took 4mins and 11 mins respectively. The original file is a 9.2MB JPEG which opens out to 69.3×46.2cm at 300ppi. Use Super Zoom in the layer mode means the resulting file has two layers with the zoomed image having the same dimensions sitting on top of the original, so needs flattening before saving. The enlargements above show that the Super Zoom tool does a decent interpolation job and the 2x and 4x magnified image looks fine considering it is a big file of an image shot at ISO 12,800. Performing some noise reduction on the original image before putting it through the Super Zoom filter and using its image enhancement controls would obviously be a benefit. In document mode, the process times were more or less the same and you just get a single-layer interpolated image of the whole frame. The 2x zoomed image opens out to 128×92.5cm while the 4x zoom is a massive 254x185cm – both at 300ppi – and the saved JPEGs at level 12 were 189MB and 518MB respectively. When I first tried to save the original 4x zoomed image, I got the warning that it had to be saved as a Large Document Format or psb file. Saving a copy as a JPEG got round this. The Super Zoom filter deserves its place in Photoshop. While the high megapixel of current cameras means the need for upsizing for really big prints is not the issue it once was for most photographers, being able to crop into images and still have a big file is a real benefit. Super Zoom does this job pretty well. It also performs a good interpolation too when a bigger file is needed from a smaller original.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'The latest variant of DxO PhotoLab 6 Elite is an impressive and powerful software with huge potential. Even priced at $219/£199 for an outright purchase, I consider that remarkably good value for money considering what you get. There’s an awesome array of tools including ReTouch, ClearView Plus and Smart Lighting to enhance your images, and DxO Optics profiles to correct camera/lens flaws. And we have left the best to last. Prime, DeepPRIME and DeepPRIME XD all do a great job when it comes to cleaning up and embellishing your shots, whether they are shot at medium or high ISO speeds. If you don’t have the budget to buy the Elite version, going for Essentials is still worthwhile because you get Prime and DeepPRIME. To be honest, the benefit in real terms of DeepPRIME XD over DeepPRIME aren’t huge. If you need a software for noise reduction only, you can save money by buying DxO’s PureRaw 3 which sells at $129/£115. It has DeepPRIME XD, batch processing and extra control. Of course, PhotoLab 6 is a much more complete workflow solution with powerful enhancement tools. It suits photographers of all genres and its superpowers with high ISO files adds an extra dimension. Not only will it help you make the most of the latest digital cameras, but it will also give your existing archive of high ISO shots a new lease of life. Highly recommended.

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'PhotoLab 6 Elite at a glance: DxO, the company with PureRaw and the Nik Collection in its stable, has revamped its flagship editing and workflow software. The updates to PhotoLab v6.5.1 from the previous version aren’t huge but they are significant you want the best image quality, especially from high ISO images. DxO has possibly the best Raw demosaicing and denoising technology available in any software. The journey began with Prime and that evolved to the even more effective DeepPRIME, and those skills were available in PhotoLab 5 . In PhotoLab 6, the technology has been advanced further with the addition of DeepPRIME XD (eXtreme Detail) and that technology is also now available in DxO’s dedicated denoising software, PureRaw 3. As a regular and keen user of DeepPRIME, I was keen to check out the benefits of XD, especially as DxO made that mode fully compatible with Fujifilm X-Trans CMOS sensors in v6.4. In v6.5.1 the software now works with Fujifilm’s most recent fufth generationmodels, the X-H2, X-H2S and X-T5. Before getting to the test, I should first cover the other key changes in version 6 and also say that PhotoLab 6 is fully supported by DxO’s renowned Optic Module correction profiles that enhance sharpness and cure distortion, vignetting and chromatic aberrations. Thousands of camera/lens combinations available. DxO has reengineered its colour processing algorithms and there is a new extended working colour space called DxO’s Wide Gamut with a broader colour range than its Classic colour space. An addition for v6.4 is the ability to use DxO Wide Gamut and simulate papers and inks when soft proofing. You can now check how images look in with the profiles that you normally use for home or lab printing with Relative and Perceptual intents available too. In any workflow, the odds are you will need to clone out the odd crisp packet, sensor spot or heal skin blemishes. DxO has a ReTouch tool (formerly called the Repair tool) to help you fulfil those needs. Essentially, the tool lets you perform complex cloning and healing tasks with fine-tunable brushes that can modified, flipped and rescaled. This means you can do more tidying up without having to go beyond PhotoLab. Finally, to enhance its workflow credentials PhotoLab 6 has colour labels for easier file management, a good search facility, extended range of EXIF and IPTC tags, and an improved projects feature to help you organise pictures more efficiently. PhotoLab 6 Elite: Open it up The clean looking interface has two tabs in the top left corner, Photo Library and Customise. This is where the editing takes place. There’s a large central area for the main image, thumbnails in an image browser below that can be undocked and panels on the left and right sides. In Photo Library mode, there’s folders, project and recent searches on the left. We have metadata, keywording and IPTC fields on the right and these can be moved around to suit. The projects feature is a good place to start the review given its prominence in the workflow. PhotoLab does not support sub-folders. The reason for this, DxO tells me, is that it would be too processor intensive. However, the option would enhance the software’s appeal. I use an Adobe Lightroom-based workflow which does have the option of supporting sub folders. I name and date the parent folder. Inside are folders for Raws, TIFFs, web images, images for print and work in progress. It is a shallow folder structure but not compatible with DxO because you need to click on each folder directly to see what is inside. The plus side of the DxO approach is that there’s no need to move or import images into the software to view and work on them. Click on a folder with images and the software loads files and produces thumbnails which it does at varying speeds depending on the number and size of files. I did this test on a M1 MacMini with 16GB RAM using image files from a range of cameras. With a folder of over 400 Canon EOS R5 full-size Raws it took a little while and of course it was the same with a folder of Raws from a Fujifilm GFX100S . As you use the scroll bar to navigate through files, the thumbnails are steadily updated. Initially, as you click on images you will see dialogue box telling you that DxO Optics modules are missing with a download button for the suitable camera/lens profile. These profiles will correct shortcomings identified by DxO’s tests going back nearly 20 years. Many thousands of camera and lens combinations have been tested. So, if your kit suffers from uneven lighting or distortion, the DxO profiles will resolve them at a click of a mouse. You only have to download each profile once. It takes no time at all and means images are automatically corrected when loaded. PhotoLab 6 Elite: Auto correct Every camera/lens combination has some form of short-coming, however minor, and profiles in editing softwares can account for these. Distortion, vignetting and chromatic aberrations are the usual things
        cured. DxO’s kit database is huge and dates back nearly 20 years and it’s extensive with newer kit too. This is a screengrab of correction DxO Optics modules for the OM System OM-1 and you can see it’s impressive with options for Raw and JPEG shooting too. Once downloaded into PhotoLab 6, profiles are applied automatically when images shot with that particular camera/lens pairing is detected. The project facility does offer a workaround the sub folder issue. In the Photo Library module, on the left side is a projects tab under which sits all your created projects or project groups. Of course, before adding images to projects, you need to identify them unless you select the entire folder’s contents. Images can be star rated by using keys 1-5. They can also be picked (hit p key), unpicked (u) or chosen for deletion (x). Handily, these are the same keys used in Lightroom for flagging up shots. PhotoLab 6 now has the choice of seven colour labels. Right clicking on a thumbnail in the browser brings up a long list of rating options. Of course, you can funnel down what images are on show, be that with star rating, pick/delete, colour labels and more. Once you have your pictures rated, keyworded and picked you can create projects or add selected files to existing projects. There are options of how you do this, plus you can just drag and drop thumbnails into project folders. Images are added to projects as virtual copies, so no files are moved; it’s like Lightroom’s collections feature. It is a reasonably quick process but if you have prospective project images across several folders, this takes time. Especially if you have large numbers of files in each folder. However, once loaded into a project they will be there ready for you the next time you fire up the software. It’s worth noting that if you make any edits to one project image the same changes will apply to the same image in other projects and that is a good thing. If you prefer for this not to happen, a new virtual copy is needed for each project. Images are shown in the browser that sits at the base of the interface and the browser window can be varied in size to make the working image bigger or smaller. Preview size can be adjusted too. The browser can be undocked to float on one screen or relocated in dual monitor set-ups. This means the image you’re working on is much bigger on screen. PhotoLab 6 Elite: Workspace options In Customise there’s the choice of standard or advanced workspaces or you can create and save your own. In the default options, the central area is again for the image being worked on with a row of thumbnails running across the base and again this browser can be undocked. In the left dock are four palettes: histogram, move/zoom, history and preset editor. Running down the right side are the specific editing palettes including Detail where the DxO denoising feature sits. Clicking on a palette header means you can move the palette from one side of the interface to the other, change their running order or have them floating. Features are brought into play by using a tiny virtual switch which sits to the left of the feature’s name. When on, the switch is blue and the name gets marginally brighter against a dark grey background. To be honest, while it is all very tasteful, the switch outline box and the feature names read out poorly when off. Lightroom uses a similar grey type out of darker grey background style and a similar font size, but it is more legible. Of course, familiarity helps, and I soon learnt to click to the left of the feature name. However, I’d prefer a more user-friendly interface to make the whole editing process more enjoyable and less of a strain on the eyes, so it’s an aspect DxO should look into. For info, my BenQ 32in screen is just within touching distance and yes, I could move closer, but I prefer not to. It’s on the right side of the customise workspace where all the editing action takes place with six icons taking you through image workflow and there is a great deal you can do in PhotoLab 6. From left to right, the icons represent Light, Color, Detail, Geometry, Local Adjustments and Watermarks & Effects and relevant palette items appear as you click each icon. In the palette drop down menu there is the option of creating your own user palettes that can be docked or left floating, and that is a worthwhile feature and good to use. Another potentially useful addition would be a quick way of turning on or off every (or a selected few) feature in a palette. As it stands, you have to turn on/off features as you go from image to image. It is possible to copy and paste corrections from one image to others but this is not the same. Having to turn features on/off is time consuming and it would make sense to me if features such as Exposure Compensation were active all the time. In the software’s preferences you can set what you want PhotoLab 6 to do when new Raws or RGB images are imported into the software. I went for
        1 – DXO Standard and all the others you can view anyway by clicking on the Presets button top right of the workspace and scrolling through the many options if you prefer a starting point for your adjustments. It is in the Detail palette where you find the DxO’s denoising technologies Prime, DeepPRIME and DeepPRIME XD. The new ReTouch tool is in the Detail palette too. Under the four quality/Prime options there is a small preview window that shows an area of the image. As you click on each of the four denoise options and you’ll see a preview. High Quality does little in respect of digital noise reduction, so I’ll concentrate on the three Prime options. There are controls to fine tune the effect in each mode. In DeepPRIME and DeepPRIME XD there is Luminance (0-100 with 40 the default), Dead Pixels (0-100 with 24 the default) and Noise model (-100 to 100 with 0 the default). For my tests I used a selection of Raws from different cameras including Canon EOS R, Fujifilm X and G-series, Olympus and Nikon DSLR and Z cameras to test DeepPRIME and DeepPRIME XD. Mostly these were high ISO shots, but I used some lower speed ones too. I tried the Noise mode at 0 and the two extremes but couldn’t see any difference in any of my test shots. I didn’t have any shots suffering greatly from dead pixels so left that feature at 0. As luminance is the factor affecting quality, I tried settings of 0, 20, 60, 80 and 100 as well as the default 40. For timing tests, I used the same Nikon D810 Raw shot at ISO 6400 through each of the four options and exported to a DNG file. With no denoising it took six seconds. This increased to nine seconds in High quality, 26secs in Prime, 10secs in DeepPRIME and 31secs in DeepPRIME XD. I didn’t expect DeepPRIME to be faster than Prime but that’s because the latter is processed using the computer’s CPU and the former takes advantage of GPU acceleration of Apple M1 chips and recent RTX graphics cards. The original Raw was 48MB and the four processed DNG files were 217MB each. In my tests, DeepPRIME XD did take image quality to the next level. Notably this was the case in high ISO images while in others you had to venture deep into pixel peeping territory to see any benefit. By that I mean checking images at 200% because there was little difference at 100%. The benefit of DeepPRIME XD over DeepPRIME was not so much in the lowering of digital noise levels but the bringing out of fine detail even if this could be minimal. If you’re making seriously large prints from extreme high ISO shots, particularly from older digital cameras, the benefit is worthwhile. With modern machines at ISO 800 or even 1600, the benefit is minimal. You might as well save time and use the DeepPRIME option which is excellent. All in all, I found DxO good to use. There are some handling niggles, but no software is perfect. If you go on end result, I think the most quality conscious image-maker will be happy with this software’s all-round skills. PhotoLab 6 Elite: Noise control PhotoLab 6 has a great deal going for it, especially its digital noise handling skills. Prime, DeepPRIME and DeepPRIME XD will improve most Raws. I did find the occasional Raw that didn’t benefit from PhotoLab’s skills, most notably pictures featuring very contrasty tonal transitions and a halo was sometimes evident. However, most shots I tested including those taken at lower ISO speeds saw a very clear benefit. The shot below was taken at a Steve Hackett gig was taken with an Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II with a 45-150mm lens at ISO 1600. PhotoLab 6 does a great job of removing the digital noise and you may find that Prime is enough. Here, the difference between the Prime, DeepPRIME and DeepPRIME XD images is not obvious even at 200% magnification. However, if look very, very closely at the guitar rosette and the detail is clearer on the DeepPRIME XD shot. PhotoLab 6 Elite: Prime benefits DxO claims a up to 2.5EV quality benefit when DeepPRIME XD is applied. We checked that out with a sequence of shots taken with a Canon EOS R3 processing Raws through Adobe Lightroom with default noise reduction and DeepPRIME XD at a luminance value of 40. With an ISO 6400 shot, a 2.5EV benefit means a DeepPRIME XD processed image should resemble an ISO 1000 shot and that’s what’s shown here. You can see that the DxO shot is impressive compared with the lower ISO shot. It’s cleaner in the sky area and the building detail is much crisper so the claimed benefit has more than a little merit.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Affinity Photo 2 is a significant update of a hugely powerful image-editor that matches pretty much anything that Photoshop can do and improves on it in many areas. In that respect, its low asking price is especially impressive. Just don’t get the idea that this is budget software, dated, dumbed down in some way or horrible to use. The opposite is true. There are a couple of drawbacks already mentioned in this review. The first is that you have to know your way around a photo editor or be prepared to learn. The second is that Affinity Photo is part of a broader design ecosystem, but there is no centralised asset management or cataloguing system. Also if you want one-click presets and insta-ready ‘looks’, you’re in the wrong place. Having got that out of the way, the bottom line is that Affinity Photo 2 is an exceptionally powerful photo editor that can handle everything from non-destructive adjustments through HDR, panorama stitching, focus stacking, 360 image editing right through to professional retouching, multi-layer composites, illustration and original artwork. There’s even a 30-day trial to help you make your mind up.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Affinity Photo 2 is one of three professional creative applications from Affinity and works alongside Affinity Designer and Affinity Publisher as part of a tightly bound creative ecosystem. Affinity Photo works perfectly on its own, however, and is just about the closest direct alternative to Photoshop on the market. Like Photoshop, it’s designed for sophisticated, detailed and advanced image editing , though it can also be used for relatively quick and simple image enhancements too. Affinity Photo 2 at a glance: Keep in mind that Affinity Photo is an all-round design tool, not just a photo editor. In this respect it’s a lot like Photoshop, so although both are just about the most powerful in-depth photo manipulation tools you can get, it’s not the only thing they do. Affinity Photo supports vector graphics for creating illustrations and type layers for adding text. It’s clear that the design community this is where much of Affinity’s focus lies. But what we’re looking at here specifically is Affinity Photo 2’s potential as a photo editor – and it has plenty. The price of Affinity Photo 2 is a little higher than the original Affinity Photo, but still low for software of this calibre. It’s so low that many people might mistake it for a budget photo editor perhaps aimed at novices, but nothing could be further from the truth. Affinity Photo might be priced like a budget program, but it’s far from that. And Adobe refugees will be delighted to learn that not only are there no subscription plans, and that until version 2, every single update since launch had been free. Affinity Photo is not really designed for beginners, it has no cataloguing and browsing features and it doesn’t offer one-click insta-ready ‘looks’ for your social channels. This is an old-school photo editor, Photoshop style, but without the cash outlay or the subscription. Affinity does not offer a cloud-based ecosystem like Adobe’s Creative Cloud, and while there is an iPad version of Affinity Photo (which is extremely good, by the way), there’s no equivalent of Adobe’s cloud based image library, as used by Lightroom. Affinity Personas Affinity Photo offers five different workspaces for different tasks. These aren’t just different configurations of the same tools. The tools are different, and you use them at different stages of the workflow. In order of appearance on the top toolbar, these are the Photo Persona, Liquify, Develop, Tone Mapping and Export Personas. You don’t go through them one by one in a linear order. You can switch between them manually as required and in some instances they will open automatically. For example, if you open a raw file, you will go straight into the Develop Persona where raw processing is carried out. It’s a bit like Adobe Camera Raw, but integrated into the Affinity Photo interface. And if you create an HDR Merge, you’ll be taken straight to the Tone Mapping Persona to make your adjustments. You’re unlikely to spend a lot of time in the Liquify Persona, unless you do some heavy retouching and like Dali-esque reality enhancements. The Export Persona is for choosing file formats, colour and compression settings. Affinity Photo saves images in its own bespoke file format, so you need these export controls to produce regular JPEG or TIFF images for sharing or publishing. Most of the work in Affinity Photo takes place in the Photo Persona, so let’s take a look at that first. This is the closest thing to editing images in Photoshop. Photo Persona The Photo Persona is laid out in the same way as almost every regular photo editor. Down the left-hand side of the screen is a vertical strip of tools, while on the right is a set of panels for layers, adjustments, filters and more. These panels can be dragged off and floated separately on the screen, or recombined in any arrangement of tabs and panels that suits you. Most regular adjustments in Affinity Photo are non-destructive. When you apply an adjustment, it’s added as a new adjustment layer and can be altered at any time in the future. Each adjustment layer can have its own mask and blend mode, which is just how Photoshop works. However, Affinity Photo also offers adjustment presets, which appear in the adjustment panel as small thumbnails showing your image with that preset applied. If you make manual adjustments, it takes only a moment to save these as presets too. This is a really neat system that lets you save and re-use your favourite adjustments. Affinity Photo also offers a large selection of non-destructive Live Filters. You can apply noise reduction, depth of field tilt-shift effects, even complex lighting effects in a completely reversible way. This is the advantage of using the bespoke Affinity file format – because this ‘editability’ is preserved when you save, close and re-open the file. Of course, you can combine regular image layers in Affinity Photo. Indeed, Affinity says the number of layers supported is infinite, though you’re likely to run
        out of memory at some point, we’d guess. Everywhere you turn in Affinity Photo, you find tools of unexpected power or usefulness. Portrait retouchers may appreciate the frequency separation feature, and amongst all the regular cloning and retouching tools is an easily-missed ‘inpainting’ tool that you can use to paint over objects you want to remove – instantly. New features in Affinity 2 include the ability to combine masks non-destructively and create Live mask layers containing luminosity range masks, hue range masks and ‘band pass’ masks. These and new ‘Layer State’ options could prove useful for photographers. Develop Persona This is where Affinity Photo processes raw images and it opens automatically with raw files. It has a lot in common with Adobe Camera Raw and offers a wide range of adjustments for optimising raw images, before processing them into an editable form for the Photo Persona. What’s new in Affinity Photo 2 is that this raw processing can now be non-destructive. You can use a ‘raw layer’ and go back at any time to change your settings. The Affinity Develop process need no longer be the one-way process it was before. This puts Affinity Photo on the same level as Photoshop, which can also work with non-destructive raw ‘layers’. Neither has the same seamless raw processing as Adobe Lightroom, however. Affinity Photo is not designed around automatic corrections and quick fixes. It will open raw files as they are and will leave you to do any tweaking or fettling needed in its five tabbed panels. You use the Basic tab to adjust exposure, contrast, clarity, saturation, white balance, shadows and highlights and more. Not all of the tools are enabled by default, and the White Balance checkbox is pretty inconspicuous. It doesn’t offer scene type WB presets, either, so you’ll have to type in your own temperature/tint values or use the sliders. In the Lens tab you should see that Affinity Photo has automatically selected a lens correction profile, but you can also carry out perspective corrections here too. Affinity Photo will apply chromatic aberration correction from the lens profile, and may give even better results using the ‘Estimate from Image’ option. The Details tab offers, as you might expect, noise reduction tools, but here also is one of Affinity Photo’s many hidden gems. The ‘Detail Refinement’ checkbox reveals a pair of simple sliders that enhance the definition and clarity of fine detail far more effectively than regular sharpening tools and without the halos and edge effects. The Tones panel has tools for adjusting curves, black and white conversion and split toning, but these are things you might elect to do in the Photo Persona. The final Overlay tab also illustrates the potential crossover between the Develop and Photo Personas. You can carry out local adjustments in the Photo Persona, but the advantage of using the Develop Persona is that it can access the extended tonal information in raw files. Tone Mapping Persona This might seem like a specialist tool, but it’s worth a closer look for a couple of reasons. The first is that HDR is not just an in-your-face special effect that’s (arguably) had its day, but an important technical tool for any photographer trying to manage very high brightness ranges in the scenes they photograph. The second is that Affinity Photo’s Tone Mapping Persona is extremely good at it! It can automatically merge a stack of bracketed HDR exposures, but it can also tone map a single raw file – and very often, a raw file will have all the extended tonal data you need. From there you can choose a Tone Mapping preset – and these are very good – or make adjustments manually. It’s often simplest to start from a preset and then wind back the settings (or beef them up) to suit the scene and your own taste. The bottom line is that Affinity Photo can Tone Map (it doesn’t use the term ‘HDR’) at least as well as any other tool on the market and, if you like your HDR subtle and not supersaturated, it’s actually one of the best. The HDR merge facility built into the Tone Mapping Persona is not the only clever image merging tool. Affinity Photo also offers focus stacking and panorama stitching. When you stitch panoramas you inevitably get ‘wedges’ of blank space around the edges where the software has adjusted, repositioned and transformed the individual frames to fit seamlessly, and in Affinity Photo you’re left to crop these out manually. It doesn’t have the clever Boundary Warp or content aware fill options in Adobe Lightroom, but then it does do an extremely good job of blending images and, in particular, blending exposure variations seamlessly. Affinity Photo can also edit 360° spherical images from cameras like the new Insta360 X3. These need to be in JPEG format and in Affinity Photo you need to swap to an Equirectangular Projection mode via the Layers menu. And if you just went “What?”, welcome to Affinity Photo. If there is a technical term for a process,
        Affinity Photo will quote it. So yes, Affinity Photo can be quite technical. But as long as you’re ready to learn some new jargon and do some exploring, you’ll soon discover just how much power this program puts at your fingertips. It may not have the surface gloss and novice hand-holding of rival programs, but it does get the job done very well indeed. The real issues with Affinity Photo 2, if any, are that it has a steep learning curve and that it lacks any kind of browsing tools. The learning curve won’t be a problem for more experienced photo editors, but even they may need to spend a couple of hours learning the ropes. What is non-destructive editing and do you need it? Non-destructive editing is where your original image stays unchanged and your editing software effectively ‘previews’ your edits, saving them as processing instructions rather than applying them directly to the pixels in your photos. But with non-destructive editing, your edits are only visible inside the software used to create them. Affinity Photo edits are only re-editable if you use the bespoke Affinity file format to save your images, just as your Lightroom edits are invisible to any other program. Non-destructive editing gives you the freedom to change your mind about your adjustments at any time in the future, but locks you into the software you used to create them. Affinity Photo for iPad Affinity Photo for iPad is sold separately or as part of Affinity’s new Universal License bundle. Affinity effectively optimised Affinity Photo for a small touchscreen interface long before Photoshop for iPad was released. It’s true that Affinity Photo for iPad can’t replicate the whole desktop interface or feature set, but it gets remarkably close. It is a slightly more simplistic workflow than Adobe’s Creative Cloud system, but one that doesn’t rely on proprietary servers or hosting. Affinity Photo for iPad uses Apple’s own iCloud storage system which, for Mac users, is part of the operating system already and, perhaps, their regular workflow.'

      value: Andy Westlake tries out the latest, most sophisticated version of DxO’s camera raw file pre-treatment software in our DxO PureRAW 3 review
    - type: conclusion
      value: I’ve used PureRAW as part of my workflow for a couple of years now, mainly to improve files shot at high ISOs. So I’m pleased to report that DxO PureRAW 3 builds on previous versions with some useful new features. It may look like you’re being asked to pay a lot of money for a program that doesn’t do very much, but nothing could be further from the truth. You’ll get strikingly better high-ISO image quality from your camera, and sharper images out of your lenses. It’s like upgrading all your kit, all at once – plus every camera and lens you previously owned, too. There’s an argument that PureRAW is expensive compared to DxO Optics Pro, which provides a fully-fledged raw converter for £199. But this rather misses the point, as PureRAW is specifically designed for people who don’t want to change their workflow and learn a whole new program. PureRAW does have its limitations, of course. Most obviously, it takes a long time to process camera raw files, so make sure you try the free trial version first, to ensure it’ll meet your needs. And of course, while it does a brilliant job of addressing high-ISO noise and lens softness, it can’t fix blur from other sources, such as camera shake and subject motion. But that aside, it’s one of the most cost-effective ways available of boosting the technical quality of your images.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'DxO PureRAW 3 at a glance: Two years after its original launch , DxO’s PureRAW software is still unlike anything else on the market. Like its predecessors, the latest iteration, DxO PureRAW 3 , takes camera raw files and converts them to DNG raw files for use in your favourite imaging software. Crucially, it does so while applying the firm’s impressive lens correction and noise reduction algorithms, which can give dramatically better final output compared to developing your files using Adobe software such as Lightroom or Camera Raw. The 16-bit linear DNG files that PureRAW creates can still be adjusted in exactly the same way as the original camera raw files, in terms of white balance, colour and tonality. This allows you to get the benefit of DxO’s image processing expertise without changing your existing workflow. DxO PureRAW 3: What’s new? Compared to last year’s version, DxO PureRAW 3 comes with some significant updates. Firstly, it gains DxO’s latest DeepPRIME XD processing algorithm. The XD label indicates that this is designed deliver extra detail compared to the existing DeepPRIME, at the expense of longer processing times. The second major update concerns how lens aberration corrections are applied. Previously, you didn’t get a whole lot of control over this. But now, lens softness can be corrected across a choice of four levels; vignetting and chromatic aberration corrections can each be toggled on or off; and distortion correction can be applied with a choice of three cropping modes. Thirdly, there’s a new file queueing system, which allows you to set up batches of raw files to be processed, with the option to re-prioritise them as you go along. So if you come across a file that you’d like to process immediately, it can be pushed up the order. This can be a handy option to have available, given that the penalty for PureRAW’s increased image quality lies in the sheer length of time it takes to process the camera raw files. It’s also now possible to export your images as TIFF files , in a choice of 8-bit or 16-bit colour depths. This makes PureRAW 3 compatible with a wider range of image processing programs that don’t support DNG files. The interface has been cosmetically redesigned, too, with a cleaner look. At $129 / £115 for a one-off licence, or £69 for users of previous versions to upgrade, DxO PureRAW 3 may look expensive for a program that turns your raw files into better raw files, but doesn’t produce finished output. However, with previous versions I concluded that it could easily represent money well spent. Let’s see if version 3 is a worthy update. DxO PureRAW 3: summary of new features How do you use DxO PureRAW 3? PureRAW can be used in several different ways. Firstly, it can work as a standalone program , into which you import your raw files and then process them. Secondly, you can batch process files directly from the Windows desktop or Mac finder, with a choice of algorithms and output file types selectable, all without having to open the program itself. Lightroom users can even invoke PureRAW directly within the program, using the ‘Export – Process using DxO PureRAW 3’ command. As the updates mainly affect the standalone program, I’m going to concentrate on that. When you open PureRAW and import a set of images, it’ll first attempt to identify the cameras and lenses you used, and then ask you to download the requisite Optics Modules (which you only need to do once). DxO’s database is vast, so most combinations are covered, but it can take a little while for the latest products to be added via the monthly updates. With unsupported lenses, the software will still work, but you’ll end up with uncorrected images. Select a file or files and click ‘Process Now’, and a window pops up prompting you to choose the processing method (High Quality, PRIME, DeepPRIME or DeepPRIME XD); the lens corrections you wish to apply, the output format (DNG, TIFF or JPG); and where the processed files should be saved. Alternatively, if you click the new ‘Add to Queue’ option, your files will get added to a queue that the program will work through progressively. Click on the ‘Show Queue’ button, and you can change the processing order simply by dragging batches up and down the list. It’s straightforward and easy to use. Usefully, PureRAW 3 will automatically name its DNG files according to the processing algorithm used. However, it isn’t smart enough to do the same with lens corrections. Instead, if you queue up variants of an image with different combinations of corrections, by default they’ll be assigned the same filename and end up overwriting each other. So you need to make a point of using the File Renaming option, which is somewhat hidden away in the dialogue box. This is something DxO really needs to fix. You can export the processed DNGs directly to Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, and in the latter case, they’ll open in Camera Raw. Any settings you’ve previously applied to the raw files in
        terms of colour, white balance and tonality will be carried over. It’s also possible to export the original raw files alongside for comparison purposes. DxO PureRAW 3: Which processing algorithm is best? I compared PureRAW’s four algorithms using files from a variety of cameras across the full range of ISO settings. While HQ provides only a modest improvement over Adobe’s processing, I found that PRIME provides around a stop of improvement in terms of noise reduction, and DeepPRIME gives a similar step up again. DeepPRIME XD brings no further advantage at low or even moderately high ISOs, but comes into its own by enhancing detail at the very highest ISO settings. A good example is provided by a photo I shot of a mandarin duck using the Canon EOS R3 and RF 600mm F11 IS STM lens at ISO 25,600 . Firstly, DxO’s HQ processing is only a little better than Adobe Camera Raw with its default noise reduction, which means it’s barely worth the effort: In comparison, PRIME is visibly more effective at suppressing noise, but it doesn’t really recover any more detail: However, DeepPRIME is a clear improvement, doing a superb job of rendering more detail without any noise penalty: DeepPRIME XD is even better here, teasing out even more fine detail in the feathers. This is real detail, too, not invented texture; it’s visible in Adobe’s conversion, but right on the edge of what can be distinguished from noise. In other situations, though, DeepPRIME XD can look unnatural; for example, it can overly accentuate skin texture in portraits, which you really don’t want. Overall, PureRAW will probably allow you to use ISO settings two stops higher than you’d previously have found acceptable. That’s a larger improvement than you’re likely to get from exchanging all your camera kit for the next sensor size up, which puts the price into perspective. DxO PureRAW 3: Image processing time The trade-off for PureRAW’s increased output quality is its processing time . It takes much, much longer to convert raw files to DNGs, than Adobe software does to convert the same files to finished JPEGs. As a result, you’ll probably want either to batch convert a set of files while you go off and do something else, or to convert only selected images when necessary. Exactly how long PureRAW will take to process your files is dependent upon all sorts of factors – pixel count, image content, ISO, and the lens corrections required, plus of course your computer hardware. But for comparison purposes, I tested it using a set of 13 raw files of our studio scene from the 24MP Sony Alpha 7C, one for each ISO setting (50-204,800). Using my 2019 Dell XPS 15 laptop running Windows 11 (Core i9-8950, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU), Adobe Camera Raw processed them in 15 seconds. In contrast, PureRAW took 2min 23sec in HQ mode; 8min 11sec using PRIME; 4min 35sec in DeepPRIME; and 9min 54sec with DeepPRIME XD. To my mind, this makes DeepPRIME the best option for regular use. DxO PureRAW 3: Optical Corrections The other major advance in PureRAW 3 comes with the control it provides over lens corrections . Previously, you could only enable/disable distortion and sharpness compensation, with corrections for vignetting and chromatic aberration always being applied. Now, you can control them all. I have no idea why you’d ever want to turn off CA correction, but I’m happy to gain the option to exploit the lens’s natural vignetting for aesthetic effect. As previously mentioned, with distortion correction you now get multiple cropping options . Alongside the standard output at the camera’s original aspect ratio, you can also choose ‘maximum rectangle’ (which will be a little wider), and ‘complete image area’, which includes all the data captured by the camera (other areas are filled in with black). These options maximise flexibility when it comes to making further perspective corrections and cropping. But it’s worth bearing in mind that you’ll be working slightly outside the lens’s design parameters at the extreme edges of the image. Here are the available options, illustrated using an image from the Leica Q2, which employs significant barrel distortion correction: There’s also now a choice of four levels of lens softness correction – Soft, Standard, Strong, and Hard – with the latter two providing an increased effect compared to PureRAW 2. This isn’t merely a boost in overall sharpening, but is profiled to address the cross-frame sharpness variation for each lens design. It should be especially interesting for photographers who choose their lenses for convenience and value, rather than paying a premium for the sharpest optics. To illustrate this, I tested the correction settings using a landscape image from the Fujifilm X-T5 with the XF 16-80mm F4 R OIS WR, which isn’t known for its sharpness at wideangle. I was impressed by how PureRAW improved the overall contrast and detail rendition, particularly with the stronger settings. It’s not the same as upgrading to a sharper
        lens, but it’s the next best thing. Below are 100% crops comparing each of the available lens softness correction settings. Likewise, PureRAW 3 can transform images shot with older kit. It produced excellent results with an old shot of a pair of penguins that I took using the Canon EOS 350D and EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens. That’s an 8MP DSLR dating from 2005, and a lens that was introduced a decade earlier (you can see the result below). As to which of the settings is ‘best’, I preferred Hard for the landscape shot, but felt Strong looked more natural with the wildlife. It’s good to have the choice.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'If I were to come back to ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate 2023 it would be for the Face AI adjustments if I needed to ‘help’ a portrait sitter look their best. While it’s easy to over-use this feature, moderate applications can be very beneficial to the sitter and the photographer at the same time. I have been impressed with the facial mapping, the customisation available and the range and effectiveness of the adjustments. I doubt I would need them all in any one sitting, but each has a place and together they present an excellent set of tools to ensure sitters will be pleased with their images. The general package is very full and the application offers a massive range of image editing options that will keep everyone happy. I’m not sure the workflow is as smooth and efficient as it could be, but many individual tools – such as the Smart Erase tool – stand out as really great performers. My main concern, and the reason I’d find it hard to come back to the program, is that things just take too long to do. An image I rotated had to un-rotate and re-rotate itself every time I adjusted its size on-screen, and the number of tools that need their own window and their own processing time would drive me mad. The new selection and merging functions deliver mixed results and could do with some automatic tuning or more manual refining options for the user. I often found a ragged selection or a fluffed merge meant that the image either needed fixing or just couldn’t be used. The program isn’t bad for the money, but I’m not especially impressed with all the new features. Related articles: Best free photo editing software for computers and mobile 2022'

      value: 'ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate 2023 at a glance: Monopolies aren’t healthy for anyone, so it is always good to see imaging software applications evolving to counter the dominance of Adobe. I don’t have anything at all against Adobe, and the company is powerful in this area for a number of very good reasons – I just like healthy competition. So many other applications have a range of strong points, but so many weak spots and missing features, that I find myself going back to Photoshop for my everyday needs. ACDSee’s Photo Studio Ultimate 2023 seems to cover most bases that are important to most of us though, and with this latest update brings a number of promising extras that could be enough to lock new users in. The more striking new features include an artificial intelligence face detection and editing tool that allows us to make extensive adjustments to a subject’s face shape, AI options for the selection and replacement of objects, skies and background, and a new merging tool that allows photo stitching, stacking and the creation of high dynamic range images. Overview For those who aren’t familiar with ACDSee’s Photo Studio, here’s a short explanation of the package and what it does. This is an image editing application that allows users to process RAW and JPEG files, and which features an organisational element for photographers to catalogue their files. It doesn’t force us to use the cataloguing feature, so gladly we don’t have to import images to work on them. We can just open, adjust and close it we want to. Much like Adobe’s Lightroom, and other programs, the path of editing is broken into different stages with a series of operating windows in which we browse our catalogue/computer folders, and then ‘develop’ and edit our images. Newcomers will find it takes a while to comfortably navigate and to understand the process, but it is mostly pretty straightforward. There is no separate workflow for RAW and JPEG files, so they both go through the same set of controls and tools, which is quite nice – we just have to be careful to notice when the JPEGs begin breaking up under extensive manipulations. I like the tools and their flexibility, and many offer the facility to moderate their impact after their application, so if you realise you’ve overdone it you are able to rein the effect back in a bit. There is a whole pile of pre-set looks and effects that can be applied to create instant results, but most of these are so extreme and ghastly they should be treated with a good deal of caution or used in moderation. While the range of controls is extensive and varied, I found it took me a lot longer than usual to process my images. This isn’t due to the number of choices – though it was at first while I explored the application – but due so many standard tools needing their own window and their own ‘apply’ process that even some simple things become quite a task. The program seems quite resource-heavy too and loading the image into a new interface for the next task involves all the previous filters and effects being applied once again in sequence before the image is ready for further work. There is a bit of a lag too in places between a slider being moved and the effect being shown, so it’s easy to push sliders too far without realising the strength of the effect. I also found the program hangs and needs restarting when faced with folders that contain both still images and videos, which is really frustrating. It seems unnecessary that so many tools are duplicated between the Develop and Edit panes, as they seem to do the same things, and moving from the Edit pane back to the Develop pane requires we save the image to ensure changes applied in the Edit pane carry forward. It all seems a bit convoluted and long-winded. In the Repair window the Smart Erase tool is exceptionally good, but each individual repair takes so long to effect that dusting a product shot would be completely impractical. However, despite all that, the results the application produces are very good and there isn’t too much we can’t do to our images using this program. I just wish it was a bit more streamlined. I also object to the fact that the application has rather invaded my Windows operating system and has put itself as the default for ‘Open With…’ options and shows all image files in Explorer with the ACDSee icon. As disorganised as I am, I would prefer to choose how image files are displayed and in which application they get opened in. It’s like having a cuckoo in my PC. It is also worth checking that the application is compatible with the RAW files from your camera – we got off on the wrong foot when I discovered it couldn’t read the images I’d taken for this test with the Lumix GH6 . Face AI The Face AI is the most fascinating element of this new application and I looked forward to seeing what it can do. This part of the program lives in the Edit pane and clicking AI Face Edit loads your image into a new interface specifically
        for this task. The AI part of the application is that it detects a face, or a number of faces, in the frame and identifies the key features of each. Eyes, eyebrows, nose, chin, jaw lines, and cheeks are detected and mapped, so the characteristics of each can be adjusted. Eyes can be opened a bit more, widened, narrowed, lifted, brought together or spaced wider and whitened. We can even change the direction in which they are looking – though unfortunately not individually. Wrinkles around the eyes can be removed and bags reduced. The rest of the face can be slimmed or bulked, made longer or shorter, foreheads extended, chins reduced and jawlines made more or less rugged. You can, in fact, alter someone’s appearance so much it hardly looks like them at all, but at the same time with minor tweaks and twitches we can moderate an unfortunate expression or make someone having a bad day look like they slept well, that they’ve been keeping hydrated and as though they don’t eat fast food on a regular basis. If adjustments are looking a bit lop-sided it’s possible to inspect and correct the program’s mapping of the face, should hair, a hat or some other obstruction have confused the detection process. I found, as with most image manipulations, that less is more and, if you intend your human to remain looking human, moderate changes that might not be noticed even by their best friends are the most effective. Bags and lines can be subdued rather than eliminated, and faces slimmed or plumped to healthier days. So long as you maintain this attitude your subject will look good and be still recognisable, but also the software will be able to work effectively. As soon as you try to make dramatic changes the artificial intelligence becomes more artificial than intelligent, and your changes will have a destructive impact. With this in mind, the measures of the adjustment strength could be tempered a little to make smaller changes easier. You might also use caution when altering the eyebrows of glasses wearers as the software will sometimes adjust the shape of the frames rather than the brows. It seems a little crazy too that the Skin Smoothing tool hasn’t been integrated with the Face AI so it can actually detect what to smooth rather than just smoothing the whole image. Selection A new AI selection section now exists in the Edit pane. These tools allow the user to make selections with a single click, as the software itself makes judgements on what is and is not required. Automated options are listed for removing a background, selecting a subject, selecting a sky, blurring a background and for making the background black and white. These tasks rely on the AI understanding what the subject is and where it sits in the frame, and then determining which bits we’ll want selected. I am really very impressed with how well the AI can identify what the subject is in the frame. With images where the depth-of-field is shallow the selective focus gives the software a massive clue, but I thought I’d be clever and offer it a rare shot taken at f/22 that has everything in focus – and it still managed to detect what the subject was. It will sometimes include other areas too, which are easy to eliminate from our enquiries, but in the main it did really rather well. It is rather less good though at actually selecting the subjects, skies and backgrounds than detecting where they are, and elements such as hair, out-of-focus features and glasses/headphone cables/accessories are sometimes left behind. The same principals and problems apply to actions to remove the background and to turn it black and white. Blurring the background can be made better by performing it on a duplicate layer and then reducing the opacity to make it less obvious when not everything has been selected properly, and of course there are tools to clean up the AI selections. I found the Select Sky surprisingly good too, and was quite amazed at how well it works. I offered it a simple sky-and-mountains shot at first which it understood pretty well. Then I gave it a much more complicated sky-visible-through-trees picture which it managed even better. Using this I was able to trade patches of white Cretan sky showing between leaves with a much bluer and more summery sky from Portsmouth – who would believe? Dropping the opacity of the post-Brexit imported sky layer allowed me to create something quite credible. I do not have the patience to make manual selections like this, so was pleased the AI action has produced something I can use. Selecting a background to make it black and white should be illegal, but performing it on a duplicate layer allows us to lightly and more tastefully desaturate a background using the opacity slider. Merging We’ve had photo merging in ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate before for HDR and Focus Stacking, but this new version also offers us the chance to stitch panoramas together from multiple images. To get my hand in I also tried out the HDR feature
        and was left with a slightly flat and dull image that was not as good as the result of processing a single RAW file of the same shot. The automatic panorama stitching gave me mixed results. Well, I say mixed, but I suppose I mean unsatisfactory. I shot eight different panoramas and joiners, and asked the program to put each set together, and only one of those was useable. The application seems incapable of creating a panorama without leaving some pretty obvious clues about where the stitches are. I allowed masses of overlap but the duplicated details weren’t used to create smooth joins and aligned sections of the scene. I worried that I’ve given the program too much overlap to work with, so tried merging fewer images with less overlap. But while that created a different result in some cases, feeding the processes less information isn’t a failsafe answer. I found repeating a merge gave slightly different results each time, so the actual answer might be to keep trying until you get a result that either works or which can be easily fixed. For comparison I passed the same sets of images through the Photomerge function of Adobe Photoshop and, while the results weren’t perfect in every case and each merge took longer, they were consistently very much better. I found the ACDSee algorithm added coloured fringing in places it didn’t exist in the individual images, double exposures, missing edges and areas of fluffy detail where there may have been at least two images providing the information needed.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: I’ve been using DxO PureRAW regularly for a year now, and over that time I’ve only come to appreciate its benefits more. If you shoot a lot at high ISOs, or indeed avoid shooting at high ISOs due to fear of noise, it’s a game-changer. About the only thing that bugs me is that I’d like to be able to disable vignetting correction, as this is very much an aesthetic choice. In some ways, using PureRAW akin to getting a new camera, given the improved image quality it delivers from your raw files. This puts the £115 asking price in perspective – you’d have to spend a lot more on hardware to get a stop better noise performance.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'DxO PureRAW 2 at a glance: Last year, imaging software experts DxO released an innovative program called PureRAW . This unique tool converts camera raw files to 16-bit linear DNGs , using DxO’s industry-leading lens correction and noise reduction algorithms. These DNGs can then be processed using your preferred imaging software, just like normal camera raw files. The idea is that you get the benefit of DxO’s image-processing know-how, without having to learn a new workflow. A mid-life update, to version 1.5, added a little extra user control over the optical corrections used, giving a choice of whether or not to apply distortion correction and/or selective sharpening to compensate for optical softness. I found PureRAW gave excellent results that represented a vast improvement on Adobe’s processing, especially when using DxO’s AI-based DeepPRIME noise reduction. This makes the program a hugely useful tool for Lightroom or Photoshop users who’d like to get the most out of their raw files, especially those shot at high ISOs or using older cameras and/or less-sharp lenses. The main drawbacks are that processing each camera raw file can take a long time, and the resultant DNGs take up a lot of disc space. Exactly how much depends on the resolution of the camera you use. Read our review of DxO PureRAW (version 1) for an in-depth assessment of its benefits Now, the firm has updated the software to DxO PureRAW 2. This comes with some useful new workflow features and additional camera support. Most importantly, it now handles files from Fujifilm cameras that use the X-Trans sensor. So what exactly is new, and is it worth upgrading for existing users? DxO PureRAW 2: summary of major updates DxO PureRAW 2: Workflow updates Originally, PureRAW was a simple standalone program. You added files to its main window, and then pressed the ‘Process photos’ button. It proceeded to churn out processed DNGs, which could then be exported to Lightroom or Photoshop (via Adobe Camera Raw). In version 2, you gain some useful additional ways of working . First is the ability to batch-process files directly from the Windows desktop, or the Finder on Macs. Simply select a group of files you wish to process, and then right-click (or ctrl-click). You should see a series of PureRAW options as shown above, allowing processing to DNG with a choice of noise-reduction algorithms. Select one, and PureRAW gets on with the job of converting those files without you even having to open the program. This is great option if you’ve shot a set of images what will benefit from treatment, as you can quickly set them processing and then go away and do something else. Lightroom users also gain an improved workflow , with the ability to invoke PureRAW from within the program itself, using the ‘Export – Process using DxO PureRAW 2’ command. So if you identify a raw file you like, start work on it and make some adjustments, but then decide that it would benefit from DxO’s processing, you can send it to PureRAW from Lightroom. Once processed, the new version will appear back in Lightroom and crucially inherit all your previous tweaks (just as long as you set Lightroom to record XMP side-car files that include this data). Again, this works as expected and counts as a very helpful addition for Lightroom users. DxO PureRAW 2: Operational updates One welcome update for Windows users is HiDPI support , which allows graphical elements to scale correctly on high resolution screens. This works just as you’d hope, with the program now rendering much better on my Dell XPS 15 laptop’s 4K display. Meanwhile, users of the latest M1 Macs are promised significantly faster speed , particularly when using the PRIME and DeepPRIME noise reduction algorithms, which are slated to operate up four times quicker (unfortunately, I wasn’t able to test this). Last but not least, DxO is also promising iterative updates over the software’s lifespan to support the latest cameras as they’re released. DxO PureRAW 2: Fujifilm X-Trans sensor support Possibly the biggest single update in PureRAW 2 is full support for Fujifilm’s popular X-series cameras that use the proprietary X-Trans sensor. It’s taken DxO a long time to get around to this, with a decade having passed since the launch of the original Fujifilm X-Pro1. Thankfully, the results appear to be worth the wait. Click on the image above to see the full-resolution version. Click here for the same file processed in Adobe Camera RAW for comparison . Just as with Bayer sensors, DxO produces files from Fujifilm X-Trans cameras that boast noticeably improved delineation of fine detail , along with dramatically reduced noise . DeepPRIME is particularly good at retaining real detail while removing noise from smoothly toned areas of the image, in a way that conventional noise reduction algorithms simply can’t match. Click here to download the same file processed in Adobe Camera Raw for comparison This advantage is maximised at high ISOs,
        to the extent that ISO 25,600 files processed in PureRAW using DeepPRIME look as good as, if not better than, conventionally processed ISO 12,800 raws. However, you don’t just see an advantage at high ISO settings. For example, Adobe software has never been especially adept at rendering grass and foliage detail from X-Trans sensors, and DxO’s processing does a much better job. Click here to download the same file processed in Adobe Camera Raw for comparison More generally, fine monochromatic detail such as fabric or hair is just that bit sharper. So even at base ISO, a raw file that’s been processed with DxO PureRAW 2 will show visibly improved fine detail compared to a standard Adobe conversion. Overall, for Fujifilm shooters who use a Photoshop or Lightroom-based workflow, PureRAW represents a huge step forwards in processing quality.'

      value: The latest version of DxO's bumper pack of film emulations promises a lot - Geoff Harris sees if it is more than just a film tribute act
    - type: conclusion
      value: While there are some genuinely useful additions to this DxO FilmPack 6 software, the ‘bumper film pack’ concept feels a little bit dated – and relatively expensive – with so many options now available these days for those seeking the analogue look. The editing tools are quite limited, although the pack does integrate seamlessly with Photoshop and Lightroom, and the interface design can be frustrating at times. Yes, it’s good to have the Fujifilm presets, but X-series camera owners have them anyway, and there are cheaper ways to get a similar look for your images. Meanwhile portrait and wedding photographers are likely to stick with a more specific set of tried-and-tested film emulations for Lightroom, such as Mastin Labs’ superb Portra set, rather than going for this ‘everything but the kitchen sink’ approach. As for the Time Machine descriptions, they can be inspiring, but many users are likely to turn them off after a while as it can distract from the actual editing. While the Nik Collection is a no-brainer for similar money thanks to fantastic tools like Silver Efex Pro, FilmPack 6, despite its many virtues, is a less compelling purchase – especially since you do get some film emulations with the Nik suite anyway. A free trial is available so you can see if FilmPack is for you.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'DxO FilmPack 6 at a glance DxO has done an impressive job with the Nik Collection since taking it over from Google, turning a neglected image-editing suite into a powerful package that manages to rival Adobe while integrating seamlessly with Photoshop and Lightroom. Its other image-editing packages attract positive attention too, particularly for the DeepPRIME noise-reduction features in PureRaw . DxO FilmPack has been around for a while, and as its name suggests, provides digital emulations of a lot of classic film emulsions. The latest version, FilmPack 6, needs to deliver more than just a bunch of new film emulations and filters, however, as DxO now has a lot of competition. This is not just coming from other software firms, such as Mastin Labs, VSCO and all the other preset suppliers out there, but also from camera makers – particularly Fujifilm, whose cameras have long had quality film emulations built-in. What’s more, LUT (Look up Table) packages are increasingly popular too, luring photographers who are eager to get more of a ‘cinematic’ look. And let’s not forget the growing number of photographers who are discovering or rediscovering film, cutting out the emulation middlemen altogether. Why should they fork out for an Ektar or Tri-X impersonation when they are shooting with the real thing and getting the negs digitised? While the film revival shows no sign of petering out, the majority of modern photographers are still shooting digitally. Introducing Time Machine So being able to get the film look from a single, easy-to-use package still appeals. In FilmPack 6, DxO has not only added more film stocks, but also introduced a novel feature called Time Machine. Essentially, this adds a timeline down the left-hand side of the screen, organised by decades. So, you can add the look of Tri-X black & white film from the 1960s, for example, while finding out more about famous photographers from that era, and indeed, the history of the film itself. In addition, the new version brings the full range of Fujifilm film emulations to non-Fujifilm X camera owners, and also offers more ‘cinematic’/colour graded looks for customers after the look of LUTs. Time Machine in practice Time Machine, while an innovative feature, is something of a mixed bag in use. The descriptions of photographic approaches and styles from a particular era are genuinely interesting, and can be a useful creative spur – aestheticism and symbolism from the 1920s, for example. Many of the descriptions are skewed towards documentary photography, however, and key historical events from the relevant decade such as the moon landings – we’re not sure how useful this will be to a landscape or macro photographer, for instance. Over to the right of the screen, you can quickly access film emulations by decade; we suspect that this will be the default destination of most users once the novelty of the Time Machine descriptions fades. Or you can bypass Time Machine altogether and just view all the available emulations via Color, Black and White, Cinematic Films and so on, and their (long) submenus. Sometimes, you can feel overwhelmed by all the different choices, although you can’t blame DxO for trying to make the package as feature-rich as possible. Once you have decided on a particular film style, it’s very easy to tweak the intensity of the look, along with key exposure settings, digital grain, and other effects such as vignetting. As with the Nik Collection, FilmPack 6 works seamlessly as a plug-in for Lightroom, Photoshop and DxO PhotoLab, so you can easily switch back and forth. If you can’t plug in to Adobe’s software, FilmPack’s editing tools will feel a bit limited. Another niggle is the interface, which can feel like an unhappy marriage of overload and minimalism at times. More options really should be added to the top menus, for example, and it sometimes takes too long to work out where everything is. New film emulations and other extras Amongst the new film emulations is Kodak Ektachrome Professional Infrared EIR, and as a big infrared fan, I was keen to give this a go. It works well enough, but you have to hunt around for it, and I found myself longing for the quick, intuitive IR conversion that you get with VSCO’s phone app. Other new stock emulations include Adox CHS 100 II, Impossible’s PX 600 Silver Shade (which gives a real kick to portrait pictures) and Polaroid 600 – so there is plenty to explore in FilmPack 6. As for the Cinematic film looks, they are helpfully labelled according to end result, e.g. Teal and Orange or Moody Dark Green. As with the Nik Collection, you can easily compare your edited image to the original, or compare different film effects side by side. New textures and effects have been added too, including crumpled paper, light leaks, and water drops. Whether you think these improve your final image comes down to personal taste, but again, there is plenty of creative scope here. Fujifilm emulations A big selling
        point of DxO FilmPack 6 is the inclusion of a range of the film simulations that come with Fujifilm X-series cameras: Classic Chrome, Classic Chrome +, Astia/Soft, Classic Negative, ProNeg Std, ProNeg High, and Eterna. They’re found under ‘Digital Films’ and as Fujifilm fans will tell you, they look great, whether you are working on JPEG images or raw files. Adobe integration Using FilmPack when you are working on files in Lightroom or Photoshop couldn’t be easier. Simply right-click on an image and select ‘Edit in…’ to open the image in Film Pack 6. You can then edit a copy with Lightroom adjustments, edit a copy or view the original – the editing is all non-destructive.'

      value: Andy Westlake explores a fully-featured imaging program for Windows users that does everything from importing images to making prints
    - type: conclusion
      value: Windows users looking for a comprehensive image-editing solution will find a lot to like about Zoner Photo Studio X. It really does do it all, from copying your pictures off your memory card right through to creating prints and web galleries; I can’t think of anything else that provides such a complete set of features. Once you’ve familiarised yourself with how it works, it’s also reasonably easy to use, while providing an impressive range of options for advanced users to configure and work with it pretty much as they please . Some photographers will object to subscribing to software on principle, but ZPS has the twin virtues of being both inexpensive, and nicely behaved if you decide to stop paying. Thanks to the Autumn 2021 update, it now also gives much better output than before, thanks to both its updated noise reduction, and its improved tonality controls. In fact, it’s now really only the lack of profiled lens corrections and camera colour matching that places it behind more expensive competitors. As an all-in-one option for all your imaging needs, Zoner Photo Studio X is difficult to match, and well worth giving a try via its one-month free trial . It’s just a shame there’s no Mac version.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Zoner Photo Studio X: At a glance Zoner probably isn’t the first name that will trip off most photographers’ tongues when it comes to image editing. But the Czech-based company is long established, with its Photo Studio program first appearing way back in 2004. Since then, the program has developed into a uniquely comprehensive imaging package. Indeed in what is a very crowded market, Zoner Photo Studio X (ZPS) stands out for its sheer breadth of capabilities. To describe it as a raw converter and image editor is almost to do it an injustice, because it promises to do pretty much everything you might need once when you get home from taking pictures. It can be used to download and organise pictures from your camera, develop and edit raw files, and then build web galleries, design photo books and buy prints. It’ll even integrate with external services such as Dropbox and Facebook. ZPS is, however, only available for Windows, so Mac users can stop reading now. It works on a subscription basis only, with no option to buy a one-off license, which might not endear it photographers who are looking for an alternative to Adobe software. But it costs much less, at $4.99 per month, which at the time of writing equates to about £3.50, compared to £10 for Adobe’s Photography Plan. While some people reject the subscription model on principle, its big advantage is that you continue to get all the latest updates and new features for as long as you keep on paying. Zoner also plays nicely if you decide to end your subscription, as you get a 30-day grace period during which the program continues to work fully. After that, its editing functions will stop working but you’ll still be able to browse your images and export them to standard formats, meaning you should never lose your work. ZPS X: Camera support Zoner supports a decent list of cameras , but it’s not as comprehensive or as quick to support new models as Adobe. However, if you install Adobe’s free DNG Converter , ZPS can use it in the background to decode raw files that it doesn’t natively recognise. The only catch is that you want to support a shiny new camera you’ve just acquired, you’ll probably have to install the latest DNG Converter version manually. Zoner Photo Studio X – Autumn 2021 update In mid-September 2021, Zoner released a major update to Photo Studio X. From a photographer’s point of view, the most significant change is that the raw development process has been substantially updated, with the firm promising up to 6x faster photo editing. Crucially, Zoner has also revised the noise reduction algorithms, which is very welcome as I found them to be a weakness before. You also get significantly improved control over tonality, with a new Dynamic range section that adds Whites and Blacks sliders, alongside the usual Highlights and Shadows (and in addition to conventional White point and Black point controls). In addition, an Adobe-esque Texture setting is now available to accentuate detail, without affecting the overall contrast. Zoner says it’s also improved how the Clarity control works. Using Zoner Photo Studio X As already mentioned, ZPS’s scope is so broad that it’s impossible to touch on all of its features. At heart, it’s perhaps best seen as a non-destructive raw editor of a similar ilk to Lightroom, but it also has a degree of Photoshop-esque layered editing built-in. However, if creative photo-art is your thing, it doesn’t go as far down that route as Skylum Luminar . It’s designed to provide maximum flexibility to advanced users, which means it’s packed full of options and user preferences. When you start the program, you’re presented with a conventional-looking main window that’s arranged into three sections. On the left is a browser panel that groups together both local folders and external locations and services. Unusually, ZPS can be used with a databased catalogue of images, Lightroom-style, or by simply pointing it towards a folder full of images, like Adobe Bridge. This can be handy for keeping specific projects separate from your main catalogue. In the middle of the screen, you get a large preview of the image you’re working on, with a toolbar of viewing options above it, and a thumbnail strip below that displays the files in your selected folder. Double-clicking on the preview toggles to an expanded thumbnail browser, which makes it easier to find your desired images, while clicking a small arrow at the bottom of the screen hides the thumbnails to display the image you’re working on as large as possible. One particularly neat feature is that you can open multiple folders and images at the same time as tabs, which makes it easier to switch between projects compared to using multiple windows. Overall, it’s probably the best laid-out image editor that I’ve used for photographers who shoot and process raw files. The business end of the program is located on the right side of the screen, with four sections labelled Manager, Develop,
        Editor and Create. The first of these provides a range of digital asset management (DAM) functions: you can edit the title, description and keywords, view GPS locations, and examine EXIF data. It’s possible to assign both colour labels and star ratings, which can then be used to filter your images in the browser. Scrolling through images is extremely quick, thanks to ZPS exploiting the JPEGs that are usually embedded in raw files. Importing images ZPS has a well-designed module for ingesting images from your memory card. It can organise imported files into folders by the date they were taken, and automatically add information such as the author name, copyright, and keywords. Crucially, if you then take some more pictures using the same card, ZPS will only import the new files. It’s also possible to auto-rename images as they’re imported, using the information you’ve added along with the date, time and sequence number. This could be handy for automatically labelling all of the images shot for a specific project or event with a meaningful filename, rather than just the one generated by the camera. Raw development Once you’ve picked a file to work on, switching to the Develop tab brings up a full set of raw editing tools that either match or exceed what you’ll find in similar programs. Alongside a comprehensive array of colour and tonal adjustments, there are gradient, radial and brush filters for local adjustments. One notable option you won’t find elsewhere is a Polarization slider, which does a very creditable job of selectively enriching blue skies and foliage in landscape scenes. Obviously, though, it can’t control reflections off surfaces such as glass in the same way as a polarising filter on your lens. Healing and cloning tools are on hand to deal with sensor dust spots or other unwanted blemishes, and if you use a graphics tablet, it’s possible to set the pen pressure to control various parameters such as the brush size or opacity. A special shout has to go out to Zoner’s excellent perspective correction tools, which do a fantastic job of automatically correcting converging verticals and horizontals, while leaving scope for the user to tweak the results. Switch to the Editor tab and you can create layered composites using multiple files, or add graphical elements including text and shapes. While it’s nowhere near as comprehensive as Photoshop, it has the main tools that photographers are likely to need. Sharing images Open the Create tab, and you’ll find an extensive set of options for making all kinds of physical output, including photobooks, calendars, prints and postcards. A wide range of templates are built in and impressively straightforward to use. You can either print your creations at home, output them as PDF files, or order them via Zoner’s own online printing service. ZPS also makes it incredibly easy to share your photos as online albums via the firm’s Zonerama service, which is accessed from the left-hand browser panel. All you have to do is create a new folder in your Zonerama space and copy a selection of images across. Once they’re uploaded, they automatically appear as a nicely-designed gallery, complete with the ability to display images fullscreen or as slideshows. Galleries can either be made public, or hidden but shareable via an obscure URL. It’s possible to rename and edit files in a Zonerama browser window just as if they were in a local folder. Overall this is a a really easy way to present your images online in an attractive fashion, especially for those who are web-phobic and don’t to deal with the complexities of laying out their own website. ZPS X: Output quality With the 2021 Autumn update, Zoner has made significant updates to its raw processing, giving considerably improved output quality. This elevates ZPS X from being a competent raw processor to one that’s really very good indeed, and a strong competitor to Adobe Lightroom. Let’s look at this in more detail. Previously, ZPS’s default raw development settings erred very much to the neutral side, with low contrast and somewhat muted colours. But now, the 2021 process starts off punchier and more vibrant, making it closer to print-ready from the off. However, while Zoner’s colour signature is generally very attractive, it’s worth noting that the firm doesn’t provide its own camera-matching colour profiles. Thankfully ZPS does understand standard DCP profiles, many of which are installed alongside Adobe DNG Converter. You just have to identify one that matches your camera manually. But the real magic happens when you start playing with the sliders in the new Dynamic range section of the Exposure tab. As their names suggest, Whites works selectively on the brightest tones of your image, while Blacks manipulates the deepest. The Lights and Shadows controls also affect the same areas, but their influence extends across a wider range of tones. Crucially, Lights and Shadows don’t interact with each other or affect the overall
        image brightness, so there’s no need to fiddle around with iterative adjustments. Clearly, the new Whites and Blacks controls are tailor-made for wedding photographers looking to balance a white dress against a dark suit. But they should be equally invaluable for landscape shooters who’d like to enhance bright sky and cloud detail while adding fill-light to deep shadows. Alternatively, they can readily balance the extremes of brightness you can get with night-time cityscapes. The possibilities are vast. Once you get used to how they all work, having these four controls for Whites, Lights, Shadows and Blacks just gives that much more control than the usual Highlights and Shadows alone. They also provide considerably greater scope for adjustment than was previously available, meaning you can extract more detail from deep shadows and subtly feed detail into bright highlights (although as always, there’s nothing you can do about overexposed regions that are completely clipped). But what’s perhaps most impressive is how these controls all work together to make massive tonality adjustments quickly and easily, without the results looking unnatural. You can see this in the example above, where I used Whites and Highlights to darken the sky, and Blacks to add detail to the rocks, without brightening the beach. The aim here is to convey the atmosphere of twilight, shortly after sunset. For comparison, you can see an unadjusted version here . (Warning – these are large files from the 100MP Fujifilm GFX100 .) Zoner’s new texture slider also works really well. It doesn’t bring any great surprises, but does a fine job of enhancing the contrast of fine detail, without impacting the tonality of the image as a whole. As tends to be the case in ZPS X, the slider’s response is really well-judged. Even at its maximum setting, the result shouldn’t look overcooked, which means there’s no need to be afraid of moving it a substantial way across its range. You can see the effect this has in the comparison below. Even viewing the image on a small scale, the Texture slider has done a great job of enhancing the folds of this elephant’s hide, without affecting the overall balance of tones. If you’d like to make a more detailed comparison, you can download the unadjusted image here , and the version with the Texture slider set to 50 here . Zoner Photo Studio X: Noise reduction Perhaps the biggest improvement introduced by the 2021 Autumn update in terms of output quality lies with noise reduction. Previously this was Zoner’s Achilles Heel, with high-ISO conversions lacking in detail while suffering from chroma noise. But toggling between the old and new processes reveals dramatically improved noise handling, particularly regarding the suppression of colour noise. I’d probably turn up the Colors Strength slider a bit further than Zoner’s default setting, but this is very much a matter of personal preference. Not surprisingly, ZPS X is still no match for the very best AI-based noise reduction algorithms such as DxO’s DeepPRIME, as you can see from my DxO PureRAW review . But a much fairer comparison is against Adobe Camera Raw, and Zoner now gives pretty comparable results. Previously, I wouldn’t have recommended ZPS X for users who regularly shot at high ISOs, but now, it’s not a bad choice at all. Zoner Photo Studio X: Lens corrections Many cameras now encode lens distortion correction metadata in their raw files, and Zoner is smart enough to apply it, so straight lines don’t appear bent. However, it’s worth noting that ZPS doesn’t include any lens-correction profiles to use with cameras that don’t include such metadata, for example most DSLRs, or Sony E-mount models. Again, though, ZPS X does support standard LCP profiles, but you’ll have to source and install them manually (again, some come with Adobe DNG Converter). Alternatively, you can use its generic lens correction tools to combat distortion, vignetting and chromatic aberration manually. Zoner Photo Studio X: Presets If you’d like to be creative with your processing, a good number of presets are built-in for both colour and black & white. It’s also possible to create your own presets if you tend to work towards specific looks. Presets can be applied at different strengths using a simple slider, which allows you to to fine-tune the output to match your preference. There’s a handy set of auto enhancement options too, for those who’d like to get good-looking results with a single click and not spend too much time fiddling around with sliders.'

    - type: summary
      value: The Peak Design Micro Clutch has been developed specifically for use with mirrorless cameras. Angela Nicholson has been testing it for our review.
    - type: conclusion
      value: Because it lacks the original Clutch’s ease of length adjustment, I find the Peak Design Micro Clutch less comfortable to use. However, its main downside is that the base plate covers the battery compartment door, which in some cases is also the memory card door. That means you must use the supplied tool to loosen the plate every time you need to change the battery or memory card. This is made worse by the fact that the tool is fiddly to use. Overall, it’s a rare mis-step from Peak Design.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Peak Design’s original Clutch strap is popular with DSLR users who like carrying their camera in their hand but want some security. However, it doesn’t work with cameras that have a grip that’s narrower than the photographer’s hand. The solution is the Peak Design Micro Clutch, which is designed to accommodate two fingers of your right hand, while your index finger is on the shutter release and your little finger is tucked underneath the camera. Peak Design Micro Clutch at a glance: There are two versions of the Micro Clutch, one with a straight or ‘I’ base-plate and one with an L-shaped plate – not to be confused with an L-bracket. The I-plate is for use with cameras that don’t have a protruding grip, such as the Fujifilm X100V or OM System OM-5 , while the L-plate version is likely to be more popular as it’s for cameras like the Fujifilm X-T5 , Canon EOS R5 and Nikon Z7 II that have a grip. Peak Design Micro Clutch key features: The first step in fitting the Micro Clutch is to decide whether you want to use it with or without the supplied tripod plate , which is compatible with Arca-Swiss clamps or the Peak Design Capture clip system. If you want to use it without, you need to use the short bolt, while the longer bolt allows the tripod plate to be attached as well as the base plate. Whichever option you go for, the bolt initially needs to be threaded into the camera’s tripod bush, but not tightened. Then the base plate, or both the base plate and the magnetic tripod plate, are slotted onto the bolt and slid into position, before finally the bolt is tightened using the concealed tool. This is fiddly because the tool is a flat-head screwdriver with its head at 90° to the handle. Next, the strap on the Micro Clutch needs to be threaded through the camera’s strap lug (or the lug supplied by Peak Design). The fastening mechanism of this isn’t as easy to use as I was hoping, which means it can’t be adjusted very quickly. A long slot in the base plate allows it to be used on cameras of different widths. However, if your camera has its tripod socket right at the front of the baseplate, like a lot of compact mirrorless models, the base plate will end up at an odd angle. Conveniently, the base plate has a hole for slipping in a Peak Design Anchor loop, and there are four similar holes in the tripod plate. Consequently, you can still use a Peak Design strap, such as the Slide, Slide Lite, or Leash , when the Micro Clutch is attached to the camera.'

      value: Andy Westlake tests a super-fast and capacious UHS-II SD card
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'When it comes to selecting SD cards, it’s notoriously difficult to navigate the confusing array of options and speed ratings available. Lexar aims to simplify things by colour-coding its cards. The Gold Series is its fastest, with the Lexar Professional 128GB 2000x SDXC UHS-II card providing the second-highest storage capacity in the line-up. Lexar Professional 2000x SDXC UHS-II at a glance: At $170 / £199 for 128GB , this card may look expensive, although it’s competitive with other premium offerings from the likes of Delkin, Sony, and SanDisk. But with much cheaper UHS-II options also available, including Lexar’s own Silver Series cards, you could be forgiven for wondering why you’d splash out on the 2000x option. The answer, naturally, lies with speed . While that 2000x label indicates a read speed of 300MB/s, write speeds are often much more important from a photographer’s point of view. Here, the card’s 260MB/s rating trounces its 1667x Silver series sibling, which only promises 120MB/s. As a result, the Gold card should have a much larger practical speed advantage than its label suggests. This ought to equate to extended burst shooting and glitch-free high-quality video recording . Lexar Professional 2000x SDXC UHS-II key features: To see how the card performed, I first tested its speed using CrystalDiskMark with my 2019 Dell XPS 15 Windows 11 laptop. This recorded a read speed of 250MB/sec and a write speed of 230MB/s. The latter comprehensively outpaced the 1667x card’s measured speed, of 120MB/s. It was also a match for the fastest cards I had to hand, including a Sandisk Extreme Pro 300MB/sec UHS-II SDXC, and a Sony G-series card (rated for 300MB/s read and 299MB/s write), both of which registered similar read and write speeds to the Lexar Gold card. The real test, though, comes in-camera . Shooting high-speed bursts with an array of cameras of different brands – namely the Fujifilm X-T5 , Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III , and Sony Alpha 7R IV – I found that compared to cheaper options, the Lexar 2000x card enabled longer bursts before the camera slowed down and/or shorter clearance times when the buffer was full. For video , the Lexar 2000x passed the toughest test I could give it, supporting C4K 50p 4:2:2 10-bit All-I recording at 600Mbps in the Panasonic Lumix S5IIX continuously until it was full. Crucially, the card also performed flawlessly in real-world operation . I used it at airshows in both the Nikon Z 8 and Sony Alpha A6700 , where I shot a lot of extended bursts without ever being held up by write times. Lexar 1667x SDXC UHS-II Silver Series If you don’t record much video or shoot fast bursts, a slower card should work fine. However, the fast read speeds of UHS-II cards can still be welcome when copying files to your computer, as long as you have a compatible card reader. Here, Lexar’s silver series 1667x cards provide a good compromise, costing $30/£39 for 64GB, $36/£66 for 128GB, and $90/£117 for 256GB.'

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Andy Westlake tests Kase’s updated magnetic filters to see how this second-generation filter system works. When I tested Kase’s original Wolverine magnetic circular filters a couple of years back, I found them to be the quickest and easiest way of working with polarising and neutral density (ND) filters. Now, the firm’s second-generation Revolution filters bring some useful updates. Kase Revolution Magnetic Circular filters at a glance: The basic idea, though, remains the same. You screw an adapter ring onto your lens, and the filters then clip on magnetically . Multiple filters can be stacked, allowing polarising and neutral density filters to be used at the same time. Entry-Level Kits include polarising , ND8 and ND64 filters (3 and 6 stops respectively), while Pro Kits add an ND1000 filter (10 stops). They’re available in 77mm, 82mm and 95mm sizes. Kase Revolution Magnetic Circular filters: key features Kase Revolution Magnetic Circular filters: new features Compared to the older Wolverines, the Revolution design brings some key improvements. Firstly, you now get two screw-in magnetic lens adapters. One is resolutely conventional, but the second is a clever new inlaid design that allows filters to sit closer to the lens’s front element. This means they should no longer vignette with lenses that are particularly picky about requiring slim filters, such as the Sony FE 24-105mm F4 G OSS . Secondly, the filters are now colour-coded to make them easier to distinguish quickly in the field – silver for the polariser, blue for ND8, gold for ND64, and red for ND1000. This is a nice idea, although to me, the actual colour scheme isn’t particularly intuitive. I’d still make a point of putting them back in the case in a specific order. Thirdly, the carry case is now made from grey fabric, rather than brown faux leather. It uses a similar concertina design as before, but now opens wider, making the filters easier to access . The trade-off is that it’s slightly bulkier. One thing that hasn’t changed, though, is the sheer quality of the filters. I tested the 77mm Entry-Level Kit using the 60MP Sony Alpha A7R IV, and saw no visible negative impact on detail . In terms of colour, the polariser is slightly warm in tone, but the ND filters are practically colour neutral , so you won’t have to correct any nasty casts. I found the new inlaid adapter ring worked perfectly with my Sony 24-105mm f/4, eliminating vignetting at 24mm when using a single filter, although I still needed to crop or zoom in a little when stacking two. Most lenses are more forgiving. More generally, though, Kase suggests buying filters one size above your largest lens thread to minimise the risk of vignetting. A handy table on the firm’s website lists which filter size works best with various popular ultra-wide zooms. Kase Revolution Magnetic Circular Filters: Kit Contents The Revolution kits include the following components. Everything fits neatly into the supplied carry case. Back compatibility with Kase Wolverine Magnetic Circulars Kase’s Revolution filters will clip happily onto the front of the older Wolverine magnetic circular filters, and they use the same step-up lens adapter rings, too. However, Wolverines have a slightly larger diameter attachment point, which means they won’t sit properly on the front of Revolutions. Sadly, this also means they don’t fit onto the new inlaid lens ring.'

    - type: summary
      value: Angela Nicholson has been carrying the Shimoda Women’s Series V2 30 backpack stuffed full of kit for our review
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Shimoda has offered women-specific straps for its backpacks for a while, but it’s now introduced a range of backpacks that are designed for women and come with the Women’s Tech Straps. There are two lines in the Women’s series, the Explore v2 backpacks that are available with 25L or 30L capacity, and the Action X v2 backpacks that are available in three capacities (25, 30 and 40L). In this review, we’re looking at the Shimoda Women’s Series Explore v2 30 . Shimoda Women’s Series Explore v2 30 backpack at a glance: The Action X v2 packs have a roll-close top and more mounting points or straps than the Explore v2 packs, making them best suited to people wanting to combine their photography with sport such as skiing or mountain climbing. Meanwhile the Explore v2 backpacks have cleaner-looking, more traditional design with a large zip-closed top section with internal organisers, a large main compartment and side-mounting points for a water bottle or tripod. Shimoda Women’s Series Explore v2 30 backpack key features: The shoulder straps can be completely removed and swapped for an alternative pair, but the supplied Women’s Tech Straps are the company’s most advanced and have a couple of useful pockets. They attach to the Explore v2 via one of three loops on either side of the back of the bag. These loops allow the straps to be positioned to suit the photographer’s height (or back length). At 5 foot 2-inches, I opted for the shortest setting. There’s also a wide waist belt that can be adjusted to size, or removed completely if you prefer. I would’ve liked to be able to tighten the belt more than is possible, but it still goes small enough to transfer some of the weight from my shoulders to my hips. As the main compartment is rear-opening, you have to take the Explore off your back before you can open the large flap to get at all your kit. That’s great for security and it means the part of the bag that will be on your back stays clean. However, there’s also a side access point , which is handy if you want swap lenses quickly. You just flip the bag around your arm and open the zip without putting the pack down. Helpfully, the flap in the Core Unit can be tucked into the Explore’s side pocket flap, so you get quick access to your gear. Shimoda Camera Core Units Shimoda makes a range of padded camera inserts, or Core Units, that are suitable for holding different sized cameras and lenses in the main compartment of its backpacks. The Explore v2 30 comes with the Medium Mirrorless v2 Core Unit , which can house a full-frame, single-grip mirrorless camera up to 12cm tall and a few lenses including a 70-200mm f/2.8. However, it doesn’t fill the main section of the backpack and I’d be inclined to invest in the Large version to maximise the camera-carrying capability. Crucially, the Core Unit’s thin but rigid walls and dividers give your kit excellent protection without bulk.'

      value: The only drawback you may face is that they are so small, once you drop it down the back of the sofa, you may never be able to find it again. Other than the physical size being extremely small, they are great value for money, offer good speeds, and can be used in a wide variety of devices. They also offer a 10 year warranty, and “6-proof” technology making them likely to survive much longer.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Samsung PRO Plus MicroSD card is a great addition for when you need to expand your memory in a budget camera phone , and shows you how far technology has come. Many years ago, you would have to pay £60 for a second hand 1GB 3.5inch Hard Drive for a PC. For those that don’t know, it was roughly the size of a book, and could hardly store anything by today’s standards. Now you can get 128GB, 128x the data (or more), in a card smaller than a very small thing indeed, at a price of just $12.60 / £10 for the 128GB Samsung EVO Plus card! Talk about progress! Chances are you might already have Samsung memory in your computer, either as RAM, or as an SSD or NVMe drive, or you may be using an external Samsung SSD drive . And as Samsung are the World’s number 1 flash memory brand, it makes sense that they would offer a range of memory cards. Using the provided SD adapter, you can use the card in any camera that supports SD cards. There are also some cameras that require a MicroSD card, such as the Panasonic Lumix GX880 – one of the smallest mirrorless cameras . MicroSD cards are perfect for smartphones, tablets, security cameras, dashcams, audio recorders, drones , and even the Nintendo Switch. Here I’m looking at the Samsung PRO Plus microSD card, available in 128/256/512GB capacities, as well as the EVO Plus, available in 64/128/256/512GB capacities. Samsung PRO Plus MicroSD Performance The PRO Plus cards offer quicker performance, as you would expect, with up to 160MB/s read and 120MB/s write speeds. Samsung say they use a “proprietary technology” to reach speeds beyond the UHS-I speed limit of 104MB/s. However, to reach these speeds, you’ll also need to be using a device that can support this. The speed class of the PRO Plus card is: U3, V30, A2, and the speed class of the EVO Plus is: U3, V30, A2 (64GB U1, V10, A1) – to understand what all this means, have a look at our guide to memory cards . In my tests using a USB3 microSD card reader I was able to get read speeds up to 95MB/s and write speeds up to 84MB/s The EVO Plus cards offers speeds up to 130MB/s (read), and they are said to be up to 1.3x faster than the previous red version of this card. In tests I was able to get read speeds up to 95MB/s and write speeds up to 66MB/s. I also used the cards in several different cameras and had no problems whatsoever with the provided SD card adapter. Samsung PRO Plus MicroSD Reliability In comparison to SD cards, there are no fiddly plastic bits to break off, no outer shell that can come away, and the cards are surprisingly tough for their size, with these new cards now offering “six-proof protection” – they can withstand water, extreme temperatures, x-ray, drops, magnetic impact, and “wear out” – withstanding up to 10,000 swipes. You’ll also find you get a 10-year (limited) warranty! Which you know you can rely on, as Samsung have been around for years, and aren’t likely to be going anywhere soon. Value for money Looking at what’s available, you’re able to get excellent value for money, particularly with the EVO Plus range, being cheaper than most branded SD cards. The EVO Pro range is a little more expensive but sits at a comparable price range to other branded cards, and is now even cheaper than before. Pricing information is available directly from Samsung :, and cards range from 64GB up to 512GB, for the PRO Plus (2021): 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and EVO Plus (2021): 64GB, 128GB, 256GB, 512GB.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Just like its predecessor, the Instax Mini Link 2 is a brilliant little device for making and sharing small prints. The app is attractively designed and easy to use, despite the wide range of features available. Most importantly, it delivers lovely little prints, with strong colours and a good level of detail. Just be aware that the prints are rather small, but if you want larger ones, consider the similar Instax Link Wide instead,
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Fujifilm’s original Instax Mini Link was one of our favourite accessories of 2019, and it’s been updated with the Fujifilm Instax Mini Link 2 with some new features. At heart, it’s essentially the same device, namely a small portable printer that connects to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth , and then prints your photos onto Instax Mini film via the free Mini Link app. But it’s more than just a simple printer, as the app includes an array of additional features, some of which are practical and creative, and others that are just a bit of fun. Fujifilm Instax Mini Link 2 at a glance: Along with the ability to print any image from your phone’s camera roll , the app allows you to extract and print individual frames from video files. There’s also an Instax Camera option, which takes pictures within the app using your phone camera and prints them directly, and even lets you use the printer as a remote shutter release and zoom controller. Creative options include the ability to make collages of multiple images, or to add colourful frames and messages onto your prints. There’s even a ‘Match test’ party game, which purports to tell you how well-matched you might be to a friend (but only if you make a print to find out). Fujifilm Instax Mini Link 2 key features: Compared to its predecessor, the Mini Link 2 gains an extra button on top beside the print ejection slot, which is used to activate an LED light on one side. Together these are used for the new Instax Air feature, which is effectively an evolution of the Instax Camera mode that adds a light painting function. This feature allows you to draw doodles on your pictures before printing them out by waving the printer around in front of your phone’s camera. A variety of colours and ‘brushes’ are available, including a spray can and a lightsabre, complete with sound effects. Alternatively, you can just draw on the phone’s screen with your finger, which is arguably easier and more accurate. In another nice update, there’s now a choice of ‘natural’ and ‘rich’ colour modes, with the latter offering deeper blues and more saturated greens, making it ideal for outdoor shots. It’s just a shame that the switch between these is hidden away in the app settings, rather than being easily selectable for each print. What is Instax Mini film, and how much does it cost? Fujifilm’s Instax Mini film is a Polaroid-like instant film. It produces credit-card sized (86 x 54 mm) prints, with a picture size of 62 x 46 mm . Standard colour film costs £15 ($18) for 20 prints , while black & white film costs £10 ($15) for 10 prints. Colour film packs are also available with a wide range of creative borders. Fujifilm claims that prints take 90 seconds to develop after they’re ejected from the printer, but in my experience that’s optimistic, and you’ll need to wait a few minutes for them to reach the full effect.'

      value: Andy Westlake reports on a hefty, well-made tripod, the Kingjoy SolidRock C85
    - type: conclusion
      value: The Kingjoy SolidRock range Three SolidRock models are available. The smallest C82 is relatively portable, but only extends to 1.2m. It costs £279, or £359 with the matched T20X ball head. Meanwhile, the medium sized C83 (above) perhaps represents the happy medium, with its 1.38m height. The leg-set costs £299, while the kit with a T30X ball head is £399. Finally, the C85 is available without a head for £449.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'We review tripods of all shapes and sizes, but rarely ones as large as the Kingjoy SolidRock C85 . Kingjoy is a new entrant to the UK and US market, with three ‘SolidRock’ carbon fibre models that are each sold either with or without a matching ball head. The C85 is the largest of the trio, and it’s a monster. At a glance: This is a four-section carbon fibre tripod that does without a centre column for maximum stability. You might think that his would limit its maximum height, but in fact, it reaches a massive 164cm . I’m about six feet tall, and this tripod places the camera’s viewfinder well above my eye level when it’s fully extended. The main penalty is a much longer folded length than usual, at 67cm . It’s also quite weighty, although perhaps not as much as you’d expect, at 2.65kg . Kingjoy SolidRock C85 tripod with T30X ball head: Key features One notable feature is a levelling base , which is controlled using a large twist lock in the middle of the legs. This lock can be pulled downwards for easier access, which is useful when you’re wearing gloves. No fewer than four large bubble levels on the leg-set, head platform and quick-release clamp aid with getting your kit set up straight and level. This is really handy when shooting landscapes on uneven ground. The leg sections employ twist locks with O-ring seals for protection against sand or grit. Each leg can be set independently to three different angles, using large semi-automatic levers.  The main head lock is likewise large and chunky, which makes the pan locks for the head base and the camera platform look incongruously small and fiddly. Once set up, this is an impressively stable tripod that gives a totally solid base when fully locked down. It comfortably handled all the kit that I had available to test it, up to a full-frame camera with battery grip and 100-400mm zoom. With no centre column, though, it’s tricky to adjust the tripod’s height; I’d have liked to see scales marked on the lower leg sections for this. The ball head isn’t the smoothest I’ve ever used, either, which means it can take a bit of fiddling around to set the camera exactly to your desired composition when using a telephoto lens.'

      value: Nanlite’s latest Pavotube incarnation brings more power and softer illumination to its ‘C’ series of RBG tube lights. Damien Demolder tests the Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C
    - type: conclusion
      value: I’ve enjoyed using this Pavotube ll 30C a great deal and have found it very useful. I have a couple of other similar light tubes, but this one is certainly better made and designed – although the handling is some way short of perfect. The Nanlite app absolves most of the handling sins, though. The battery charges quite quickly, holds its charge well and lasts at least a couple of hours on full blast – and of course we have multiple ways to power it when the battery dies. The light is also nicely diffused and for most subjects can be used directly without further diffusion, but obviously when you need to be flattering it is still a relatively hard source. Having the RGBWW LEDs means we can make tiny changes to have anything from a hint of warmth to dramatic hues, as well as the practical daylight and tungsten colour temperatures. For all that it can do and its size, I think the Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C offers pretty good value for money. Give me a better clamp and an easier-to-use control system and this will be a 5-star product.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Nanlite Pavotube II 30C is an LED tube light with red, green, blue, warm white and cool white (RGBWW) LEDs, which allows it to produce output of almost any colour, along with white light across a broad colour temperature range. Powered by either mains, battery, or USB-C, it provides an illuminated area approximately 4-foot long. It’s controlled using either a pair of dials at one end, or from your smartphone using the Nanlink app. Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C at a glance: Working as a photographer’s assistant in the dim and distant past, I remember being very impressed with a pair of gigantic, but ancient, strip-light flashes that I was tasked with wheeling out on special occasions when we needed a bit of dramatic side lighting. Powered from an equally gigantic battery pack, the lights let off an alarming ‘pop’ when triggered and the force of the blast could lift a small child off its feet. The swarm of LED tube lights currently on the market are an infinitely more convenient form of that sort of strip flash, and with their tiny modern R(ed), G(reen) and B(lue) LED emitters, rolls of gels are no longer required when we want to change the colour of the light. And as modern tube lights are battery-powered, they are as useful on location as in the studio. Nanlite has been a prominent player in the LED tube market for some time, and now has a range of Pavotube lights from the low-cost T8-7X tubes to the more expensive and powerful Pavotube X series. This Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C sits in the middle of the bracket, and is claimed to offer advanced features, good build and plenty of output at an intermediate price. Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C: Features The Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C is part of the second generation Pavotube series, and was launched alongside the 2ft long Pavotube ll 15C in January. The light is a tube full of red, green, blue, white and warm white LEDs that can be mixed to produce a wide range of colours as well as straight white light. The tube emits light through a diffused panel that covers just under half of its circumference, but as the tube is cylindrical, the spread of light is quite wide. No figures are given for the angle of the spread, and it is hard to measure, but it is certainly 40° or so greater than the 180° spread you might expect – though obviously the main thrust is forward. Accessory barn doors are available to narrow the beam when needed. Users can control the colour of the output using two principle methods. HSI mode gives us control of Hue, Saturation and Intensity, and CCT mode allows us to dial in the colour temperature in kelvin. In HSI mode, we have 360 hue settings to choose from, that take us through shades between red, green and blue and mixtures of the three. The colour saturation can be varied in steps from 0 for white light to 100 for the greatest intensity of colour, and we can control brightness in single percentage steps from 0-100. In the CCT mode, the light offers us kelvin temperatures from a very warm 2700K to a very cool 7500K – including the key 3200K tungsten and 5500K daylight/flash settings. A new +/-150-point green/magenta shift options allows us to add a bit more pink or green to our kelvin sections. An effects mode gives us access to 15 special effects that involve the light flashing to emulate lightning, paparazzi flashes, the coloured strobe of a disco, the flicker of a TV or the flame of an open fire. These can also be customised via the frequency of the flashes/changes of colour etc. The Pavotubes have a built-in battery but can also be powered via the mains with the supplied adapter, or with a 30W PD USB-C power source. The light can be used while it is charging, and the battery charges when it is connected to an external power source. The differences between this Pavotube ll 30C and the original Pavotube 30C include 20% brighter output, a metal and locking DMX port, 8 more effects, the green/magenta shift feature in CCT mode, heavier diffusion and more space devoted to the lit area of the tube and less to the endcaps. Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C: Summary of k ey Features Nanlite Pavotube ll 30C: In use I used this light in set-ups for portraiture and product photography and found it very useful. Some people will buy this sort of light to actually put in a scene so it features in the background like a neon light, and you can buy sets of four lights and brackets to connect them to make your backdrop look funky. It’s a bit of a waste really, as there are cheaper lights – such as Nanlite’s Pavotube T8-7X – that are more appropriate for the task. In product work these tubes are ideal for lighting a background as they produce long, even coverage that avoids the hotspots of regular bulbs. They are also good for creating a keyline on the side of a product to lift it from the background. I also found the tube worked well as a hair-light in portraits – either positioned upright to the side or horizontally over-head. In this role they can add warmth or colour
        to the hair as well as lifting the subject from the background. Positioned directly above the camera a horizontal tube can create a fabulous flat light on the face (see example above), or work as a nice fill when other lights are operating as the main light. Although the light looks bright to the eyes indoors, it is no match for flash. The quoted 647 lux/ 60fc at 1m using the 5600K setting translates into f/2.4 at 1/60sec and ISO 100 in real money – so either get it close, or crank up your camera’s ISO setting. The bracket clip that comes with the light is plastic and see-through to provide unbroken illumination, but it doesn’t really feel strong enough to hold the weight when the light needs to be positioned at an angle. The clip uses a pair of ¼-20 threads which means we’re rather restricted to mounting the light on a tripod head – and one with two screws so the clips doesn’t rotate on the head. Better clamps are available as optional accessories. The mark ll tubes have a simplified control system to make the button area of the body smaller, and the lit area larger. This boils down to fewer buttons and a heavier reliance on the LCD screen for mode, hue, saturation and hue changes. This is great news in principle, but the display screen is pretty small and uses small text that isn’t easy to see in a rush. We also rely on two knobs on the end of the light for making changes – one for scrolling and one for adjusting. As they are identical it’s extremely hard to remember which does what. It would be easy to colour-code the knobs or to make them different in design to solve this issue. Fortunately the Nanlite smartphone app connects immediately, is excellent and makes controlling the light, and any number of others, much simpler. Once you have it installed, you may not feel the need to interact with the physical controls on the light itself.'

      value: Andy Westlake investigates Datacolor’s latest monitor calibration device, the Spyder X2 Ultra
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Datacolor Spyder X2 is the latest iteration of the firm’s monitor calibration device. It’s designed to help photographers and videographers adopt a colour managed workflow , ensuring that their laptop screens and desktop monitors all display images and footage accurately. Compared to the previous SypderX model, the hardware looks practically identical, just updated with a USB-C connector rather than USB-A. However, the software has been substantially revised. Datacolor Spyder X2 Ultra at a glance: Datacolor offers the Spyder X2 in two versions, Elite ($269.99 / £249) and Ultra ($299.99 / £299). The main difference between them is that the Ultra allows profiling of displays with a maximum luminance of up to 2000 nits , which should be valuable to photographers who require such super-bright monitors for tethered shooting outdoors. Meanwhile the Elite version is limited to standard displays up to 750 nits . I was provided with the Ultra version for review. Datacolor Spyder X2 Ultra key features: When you first open the box, you’re directed to download, install, and activate the software , which can be done on as many computers as you need, either Mac or Windows. Then to profile your display, it’s simply a case of plugging in the device and following the onscreen prompts. This is all pretty straightforward, and the actual calibration process is notably speedy, taking less than 90 seconds to complete. Once done, the software will show how your monitor measures up against common colour spaces such as sRGB and Adobe RGB. You can also set yourself a reminder to reprofile regularly, which should ensure your monitor continues working to the best of its potential. That’s not all the device can do, though. There’s an option for colour-matching multiple monitors as closely as possible, which is great for those who work using multiple displays. There’s also a Display Analysis module, which includes a suite of tests for such things as colour accuracy and colour/brightness variation across the screen. This could be handy if you need to troubleshoot a suspected problem with your display. But I suspect most users will run it once out of curiosity, stare at all the numbers and graphs, and wonder what they’re supposed to make of the information. Datacolor’s software also allows you to soft-proof images. In other words, it’ll visualise how they should turn out when printed on different media and can highlight areas that risk being out-of-gamut. This is potentially a handy feature if you don’t have software that can do it already (most obviously Photoshop).'

      value: Andy Westlake tests a multi-functional L-bracket for Sony A7-series cameras, the 3 Legged Thing Alfie
    - type: conclusion
      value: For Sony Alpha users, the 3 Legged Thing Alfie is a nicely made L-bracket that works well, fitting the camera perfectly without obstructing any of its functions. It also has a few neat tricks that you won’t get elsewhere. It’s just rather pricey and fiddly to use. 3 Legged Thing’s L-bracket range 3 Legged Thing also makes the Freya for the Fujifilm X-T5 ; Gracy for the Fujifilm GFX100S and GFX50S II ; Ollie for the OM System OM-1 ; Roxie for the Canon EOS R5, EOS R6 and EOS R6 Mark II ; Zelda for Nikon Z5 , Z6 , Z6 II, Z7 and Z 7II ; and Zaara for the Nikon Z9 . Meanwhile, its Ellie and QR-11 2.0 brackets are universal designs, which aim to fit a wide range of cameras. They’re cheaper than matched brackets, but won’t fit quite as well or offer the same specialist functionality.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'If you frequently shoot using a tripod, an L-bracket can be very useful, as it allows you to switch your camera to portrait orientation while holding it directly above the centre column for maximum stability. The 3 Legged Thing Alfie is designed for use with a range of Sony Alpha full-frame mirrorless cameras , and employs standard Arca-Swiss type plates that will fit many tripods. Specifically, the firm says it’s compatible with the A1 , A7 III, A7 IV , A7R III , A7R IV , A7R V , A7S III , and A9 II. 3 Legged Thing Alfie at a glance: Alfie is supplied in two parts, so first you need to assemble it. This simply requires undoing a couple of screws on the horizontal section, sliding the vertical bracket in place, and then fixing the screws back up again tightly. It’s very easy and only takes a minute. 3 Legged Thing Alfie key features: Tools included: 3 Legged Thing supplies a Toolz multi-tool in the box, along with two different sizes of hex key Cable management: A slide-on bracket can be used to secure cables, which is especially useful with cameras that have micro-HDMI ports Peak Design Capture compatible: An add-on adapter plate is supplied for use with the Peak Design Capture V3 system Not just black: There’s a choice of three colours available: Copper, Slate Grey, and Midnight (matte black) The horizontal section has been custom designed to fit the camera as closely as possible, with a curved lip that matches the body’s baseplate to prevent twisting. Meanwhile the vertical section is attached to a sliding arm that can fixed at three different distances from the camera body. You’ll need to extend it if you wish to use a wired shutter release in portrait format, or to secure an HDMI cable in place using the supplied clip. I tested Alfie on Sony’s Alpha A7R IV and A7 IV bodies and found that it fitted both perfectly . You still get full access to the battery compartment and connector ports, while a cut-out in the vertical bracket allows extensive movement of the latter’s side-hinged articulated screen. I also tried it on the older Alpha A7 II and discovered that it fits that camera pretty well, too. It’s not perfect, though. My biggest gripe comes with extending the vertical bracket: you have to undo a screw using a small hex key, slide the bracket and find the next position, and then screw it up again. It’s fiddly, and I wouldn’t want to do it in a hurry in the field. One solution would be to leave it extended, but that takes up space unnecessarily. It’s worth noting that the camera won’t sit flat on a table with Alfie fitted, as that adjustment screw always protrudes below the bracket. It’s also apparent that, to provide access to all the ports, 3 Legged Thing has had to pare back the vertical section substantially, compared to its other L-brackets. As a result, it’s particularly important to ensure your tripod’s clamp bridges the cut-out for the screen. Otherwise, the bracket can flex noticeably.'

      value: Sony’s latest APS-C model, the Alpha A6700, comes with a whole host of updates and improvements, but is that enough to see off the competition? Andy Westlake finds out
    - type: conclusion
      value: Unfortunately, though, despite its many improvements, A6700 still left me a little cold. Even after reconfiguring its controls to suit my preferences, it never quite provided the seamless, fluid operation I’d expect from a camera aimed at serious enthusiasts. Much of this comes down to Sony’s failure to add a dedicated AF-area controller, forcing you to use either the touchscreen or the d-pad instead. But the latter ends up being used for too many things, so it’s all-to-easy to find yourself changing the wrong setting by mistake. It’s an exercise in frustration, and there’s a good reason why you’ll find a joystick on most enthusiast-focused rivals (not to mention Sony’s full-frame cameras). Whether you take to the Sony Alpha A6700, then, may well boil down to how you consider a camera should work. If you’re more concerned by what it can do, and less by the shooting experience, it’s undeniably an extremely capable tool. For photographers with an existing APS-C E-mount lens collection, or indeed for full-frame Sony shooters considering adding a smaller body to their kit, it really is the obvious choice. But for those with no existing brand allegiance, things are less clear-cut. Personally, to take pictures for pleasure, I’d rather pick up a Fujifilm X-S20 or X-T5 instead.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Sony Alpha A6700 at a glance: Superficially, the A6700 looks much like its predecessor, with the same low-profile, boxy body, prominent handgrip, and corner-mounted viewfinder. However, it gains a whole host of hardware updates and interface improvements , many of which are extremely welcome. But for all those Sony users who’ve been longing for an SLR-shaped APS-C model for the past decade – sorry, you’re not getting one this time around, either. With a 26MP BSI CMOS sensor onboard, the A6700 becomes Sony’s first APS-C stills camera to surpass the 24MP mark. However, that now looks modest compared to the 32.5MP Canon EOS R7 , which costs almost exactly the same as the A6700, or Fujifilm’s 40MP X-T5 (£1699 body-only). Whether many users really need such high resolutions is debatable, but they’ve always been seen as a key selling point. In reality, though, there’s much more to cameras than just sensor resolution, and the A6700 is packed full of all of Sony’s latest imaging technology, including sophisticated subject detection autofocus and 4K 120fps video recording. But does it offer a sufficiently compelling package to tempt enthusiasts? Sony Alpha A6700: Features At the A6700’s heart is a 26MP BSI-CMOS sensor , which presumably is similar to that used by the Sony FX30 cinema camera. It works together with a Bionz XR processor to offer a sensitivity range of ISO 100-32,000, expandable to ISO 50-102,400. Continuous shooting is available at up to 11fps, with a 59-frame raw buffer. This isn’t exactly sluggish, but competing models can go faster. Autofocus employs 759 phase-detection points covering 95% of the image area, compared to 425 points over 84% on the A6600. The AF system also works in a lower light, equating to -3EV rather than -2EV (with an f/2 lens). Full-time direct manual focus allows you to override the autofocus when desired, in both single-shot and continuous focus modes. The A6700 also inherits Sony’s latest subject-detection system from the flagship Alpha 7R V , which is powered by its own AI processor. It can recognise humans, animals, birds, insects, cars/trains, and airplanes, and track focus on them while shooting high-speed bursts. But you have to pre-select the subject type manually – there’s no auto option – and the camera still can’t recognise humans at the same time as animals. Sony says the A6700 should deliver improved colour and auto white balance compared to its predecessor, for example in the shade of a green foliage. The firm’s Creative Looks are on board, providing 10 colour Presets for tweaking the camera’s output to your tastes. But they’re named via pretty opaque 2-letter abbreviations, which makes it less than straightforward to remember what each is supposed to do. Noteworthy additions to the A6000 series include lossless compressed raw recording and 299-frame focus bracketing. Another key feature is 5-axis in-body stabilisation, which promises 5 stops of shake reduction. Unlike many similarly-priced cameras, though, there’s only space for a single SD card slot, due to the low flat-bodied design. This may be a concern to photographers who regularly shoot one-off events and value the reassurance of being able to back up their files to a second card. As expected, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are built in for smartphone connectivity , offering the usual range of functions. You can control the camera remotely, geotag your photos while shooting, and copy files across to your phone for sharing via social media. Sony also offers a standalone Bluetooth Remote Commander, the RMT-P1BT. There’s a significant boost to the video capabilities too, including the ability to record in 4K resolution at 100 or 120fps. These frame rates do, however, come with a 1.6x crop. In contrast, 4K video at 60p or lower employs 6K oversampling from practically the full sensor width. The camera records in 10-bit 4:2:2 colour, with S-Cinetone, S-log3, and LUT support all built-in to help achieve your desired look. Real-time subject tracking autofocus works during video recording, and Sony is promising reduced rolling shutter effects compared to the A6600, which should mean less distortion when panning or recording moving subjects. Those who like to record themselves will be pleased to find the firm’s new Auto-framing feature onboard. However, it’s worth noting that none of Sony’s other signature vlogging functions from the ZV-series have made it across. Sony Alpha A6700 key features: In design terms, the A6700 owes a lot to the full-frame Sony Alpha A7C, but with some major improvements. Sony Alpha A6700: Build and Handling Like Sony’s previous APS-C cameras, the A6700 is pretty compact, due to its rangefinder-style design. It maintains similar dimensions to the A6600, at 122mm wide, 69mm tall, and 75mm front-to-back. This means it’s distinctly smaller than either the Fujifilm X-S20 or Canon EOS R7 , although you’ll still need a bag to carry it around. It may just about fit into a large coat pocket if
        you go for the 16-50mm lens, but I’d advise against that – it’s not a great lens. The 18-135mm kit is a much better bet. Previously, I’ve never been much of a fan of the A6000-series cameras, due to their fiddly, unintuitive control layouts. But to its credit, Sony has taken the opportunity to address many of the flaws of the older models. As a result, the A6700 turns out to be considerably nicer to use than the A6600 was – at least, once you’ve got it set up. In terms of design and layout, the A6700 owes more to the full-frame Sony Alpha A7C than it does to the A6600. However, it boasts significant improvements over either. Most importantly, it finally – finally! – has an electronic front control dial embedded below the shutter button. This means that you no longer have to change almost every setting by waving your right thumb around the back of the camera. It also boasts a larger grip that feels more secure in your hand, particularly with larger lenses. As on the A7C, the A6700 has an AF-ON button on the back which engages subject tracking, in place of the A6600’s fiddly AE/AF controller. Likewise, the video button is now more conveniently located on the top plate, in effect swapping places with its predecessor’s C1 button. A stills/video/S&Q selector switch is stacked below the mode dial, like on the firm’s recent full-frame models, which allows the mode dial to be simplified down to the PASM and Auto modes, plus three custom memory positions labelled 1-3. But the rest of the control layout is essentially unchanged since the original A6000 appeared almost a decade ago. What this means is that, sadly, Sony still hasn’t found the space to fit a joystick controller on the back. So if you want to move the AF point using physical controls, you have to use the multi-functional rear dial / d-pad controller. But this already controls one set of functions, so you have to toggle its mode using the centre button. It’s all too easy to find yourself changing the wrong setting by accident. This highlights something of a theme with the A6700. While the control layout is considerably improved, the default setup fails to make best use of it, so you’ll probably want to exploit the extensive customisation options to get the most from the camera. Out of the box, the two main dials are strangely under-used, with both doing the same thing outside of manual mode. Meanwhile, the rear control wheel does nothing at all, at least directly. Almost the first thing I did on receiving the camera was place exposure compensation onto the top thumbdial, and ISO onto the rear wheel. Another example of Sony’s frustrating programming comes in playback. It’s possible to star-rate images while you’re reviewing them, which is handy for highlighting your favourites (the ratings will show up in most imaging software). But unfortunately, Sony hasn’t assigned this function onto a button, presumably expecting you to use it via the menu instead. I set it onto the C1 button for easy access. One area where the A6700 is dramatically improved, though, lies with its touchscreen , which on the A6600 did barely anything useful at all. Now, both the onscreen Fn menu and the main menu are touch-sensitive, which makes them much quicker to use. You also get Sony’s new set of touch buttons down either side of the screen for quickly changing secondary settings, which can be turned on and off by swiping left/right across them. The overall effect is to reduce dramatically the amount of button pressing needed to operate the camera, which can only be a good thing. Custom camera setups can be stored for rapid recall via the numbered positions on the mode dial. This can be handy for switching between different shooting scenarios, such as portraits, sports, or wildlife. What you can’t do, though, is give these setting memories descriptive labels to match their intended purpose. Another feature that I found useful is the ability to configure groups of Custom Shooting Settings for recall via a custom button, for example setting the AF-ON button to engage continuous shooting as well as AF-C and tracking. But it’s not especially intuitive to set up. Once I got the A6700 set up to my liking, though, I found it far less frustrating to use than any previous Sony A6000-series model. However, I can’t help but feel that its main competitors from Canon and Fujifilm are still more enjoyable to shoot with. They don’t require any menu tinkering, either. Sony Alpha A6700: Viewfinder and screen On paper, the A6700’s viewfinder looks much the same as before, with the 2.36m-dot OLED unit offering 0.7x magnification. This is impressive given the low-profile body, as it’s larger than the viewfinder in either the A7 C, or the Fujifilm X-S20. However, Sony’s says it’s brighter than previous models, and almost on a par with the superb viewfinder in the flagship A7R V. There’s a choice of 60fps or 120fps refresh rates, but the latter inevitably comes at the expense of battery life. The
        LCD screen is also significantly improved, being a 3-in, 1.04m-dot unit of the side-hinged fully articulated type. It can swing out by almost 180° and then twist through 270°, allowing it to face in almost any direction, rather than just tilt up or down. You can also fold it facing in against the body for protection against scratches. As the icing on the cake it now has 3:2 aspect ratio, rather than 16:9, which gives an appreciably larger image both for composition and platback. Sony previews exposure, colour processing, and depth of field, giving a good idea of how your shots will turn out and whether you may wish to apply any exposure compensation. There’s a whole array of viewing aids available, including gridlines, levels, a live histogram, and zebra pattern display to visualise areas of the image at risk from clipping to white. But what you don’t get is any option to view a more neutral display with minimal image processing. Sony Alpha A6700: Autofocus With Sony’s latest real-time subject detection on board, in principle the Alpha 6700 has one of the most capable autofocus systems around. Out of the box, the camera is set to use wide area AF, coupled with Automatic AF that switches automatically between single shot and continuous modes. Uniquely, in this setup three buttons activate AF in different ways. Half-press the shutter button , and the camera will automatically choose a subject and autofocus. Press the AF-ON button , and it’ll engage continuous AF and track focus on the selected subject if it moves around the frame. Meanwhile, pressing the centre button of the rear wheel will activate autofocus in Center Fix mode, which in principle allows you to override the camera’s selection. On paper, this is perfectly logical, although Center Fix uses a larger AF area than I’d like. It’s a shame you can’t set a smaller one, like with the Spot mode. Naturally, this approach also depends on the camera selecting a sensible object to focus on, which is where the subject detection system comes in. Tapping an onscreen touch button cycles through the available options, namely Human, Animal/Bird, Animal, Bird, Insect, Car/Train, and Airplane. Then when the camera detects an object of the specified type, it will outline it and autofocus accordingly. If you prefer, you can assign subject selection to a function button – I used the video button in stills mode. In practice, this AF setup works well, just as long the camera has a single well-defined subject to concentrate on (and assuming you have time to select the right subject type). However, the problem arises when there are multiple possible subjects. Then the camera will outline them all in the viewfinder, but with no joystick controller, there’s no means of quickly selecting between them. So you just have to hope the camera makes an appropriate choice. AF area selection is also frustrating when you want to turn off subject detection and tell the camera where to focus using Spot mode. Then you have to use the directional keys to move the focus point. But as the d-pad also changes drive mode, ISO, exposure compensation and display mode, you have to toggle it between operational modes by pressing the centre button. It’s just a bit long-winded and error-prone compared to having a dedicated control. If you can live with these operational quirks, though, you’ll find the A6700’s autofocus system works very well. I tested it using the new Sony FE 70-200mm F4 Macro G OSS II, with which is delivered an impressively high hit-rate of blisteringly sharp, in-focus shots. Third-party lenses perhaps won’t work quite so well, but I also got good results shooting at an airshow using the Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG DN OS. Sony Alpha A6700: Performance In practical use, the A6700 turns out to be a very capable camera that consistently delivers good-looking images . I wouldn’t say it’s quite as charismatic and refined as its Canon and Fujifilm peers, though; for example, the shutter is relatively noisy, operating with a clearly audible clack. But whether this matters to you will come down purely to personal preference. The camera can be completely silent if you switch to the electronic shutter, but this brings quite severe rolling shutter distortion with fast-moving subjects. With Sony’s chunky FZ100 battery on board, the A6700 delivers impressive stamina. As usual, exactly how many shots you’ll get from a charge depends very much on how you shoot. The most I got from a single charge was around 1650 shots, with a few short video clips thrown in for good measure, but this included a lot of extended bursts. More generally, Sony’s specified 550-shot rating using the viewfinder seems quite realistic. It’s always worth having a spare battery, but I doubt you’ll need more than one. While the camera is capable of continuous shooting at 11fps, as usual with Sony, the devil lies in the detail. You’ll only get this speed in H+ mode, which doesn’t provide live view between frames, which means
        it’s no use for tracking moving subjects. Raw shooters also need to use the (lossy) Compressed option; if you select Lossless Compressed instead, the rate drops to 10fps, with a smaller 24-frame buffer. Personally, I’d recommend switching to H mode, where the speed drops to 8fps, but you do get live view along with a usefully deeper buffer (40 frames lossless raw, and an impressive 390 frames in compressed raw). Sony’s in-body stabilisation works perfectly well, giving me decently sharp images at shutter speeds as slow as 1/2 sec (using either the Sony E 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 OSS kit zoom at its 24mm mark, or the unstabilised Sigma 30mm F2.8 DN Art). This is really useful for hand-holding in low light, and a major advantage over the many APS-C models that don’t include IBIS, such as Sony’s cheaper A6400. However, it’s not any better than competitors such as the Fujifilm X-T5. On the whole, though, I was pretty pleased by the images I shot with the A6700. The metering is reliable and seems less prone to underexposure than previous Sony models. It’s also easy to judge in the viewfinder when highlights are likely to get clipped irretrievably, and apply exposure compensation accordingly. Sony also appears to have delivered on its promise of improved auto white balance , to the extent that I felt the A6700 delivered clearly more attractive JPEGs compared to even the A7R V full-frame flagship. The colours are perhaps not quite as bright and punchy as you’ll get from some other cameras, instead being more lifelike and natural. But in general, I’d be happy sharing images direct from the camera with little or no additional processing, which isn’t something I’d have said of previous Sony cameras. In the absence of raw support from Adobe, it’s not yet really possible to see how this sensor compares to its peers in terms of raw dynamic range. But all the indications are that it should measure up well against its peers – after all, chances are it’s essentially an APS-C version of the A7R V’s 61MP full-frame sensor. Sony Alpha A6700: ISO and Noise High-ISO performance looks to be on a par with what we’d expect from an APS-C sensor. Fine detail is retained nicely up to ISO 1600, beyond which it gets progressively lost to noise. By ISO 6400, most pixel-level detail has been lost, while shadow areas are starting to block up. I’d still be quite happy shooting at ISO 12,800, but beyond that things get progressively sketchy. As tends to be the case, the extended settings past ISO 32,000 really are best avoided.'

      value: Is the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV still one of the best Micro Four Thirds cameras for beginners in 2023? We investigate in our full review.
    - type: conclusion
      value: At first glance, it might have been easy to dismiss the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV as a pretty minor update. Even at the time, there were other entry-level models boasting more sophisticated autofocus systems and vlogger-friendly features, and the number has only increased as the years have advanced. One might be tempted to dismiss this camera as an also-ran but that would be a huge error, because in this case, the whole is rather more than the sum if its parts. Just like its predecessor, it’s a lovely little camera that’s a joy to use and delivers great pictures. Indeed the E-M10 IV has plenty to recommend it compared to its competitors. It may not have the Sony A6100’s exceptional autofocus, but it’s vastly more pleasant to use. Beginners should find it as easy to use as the Canon EOS M50 Mark II or Canon EOS R50 , but its twin-dial design provides a significant advantage for those who’d like to take more control. It’s as attractively designed as the Fujifilm X-T30 Mark II , but has none of the operational hang-ups that mar the experience of using that camera, and is also cheaper to buy. Crucially, it provides access to a large range of small, light and relatively affordable lenses, and its in-body stabilisation will work with every single one. This is a particular advantage of Micro Four Thirds that to our mind goes often overlooked, particularly when it comes to travel photography. See our piece on why Micro Four Thirds offers something no-one else can for more detail on this. Ironically, though, one group of potential buyers that the Mark IV probably won’t satisfy is expert E-M10 II owners looking to upgrade to a 20MP sensor. Olympus has stripped away a lot of features in the meantime, and produced a rather different camera. Presumably the firm would prefer these users to buy an E-M5 III or even an OM System OM-5 . Overall though, the baby OM-D again becomes one of our top picks for budding photographers looking to buy their first ‘serious’ camera.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV was announced three years ago, and three years in photography is a long time. Enough time, in fact, for a significant changing of the guard behind the scenes, as Olympus is no longer Olympus any more. The Olympus Imaging brand that took the wraps off the E-M10 Mark IV was sold to OM Digital Solutions, and has since been reborn as OM-System . While at the time this sounded like a bit of a death knell, these days, the brand is in a stronger position than ever, following the release of fantastic cameras like the OM System OM-5 , announced in late 2022, and before that the gap-bridging OM-System ‘Olympus’ OM-1, which arrived at the start of the same year. These cameras have built on the Olympus legacy, playing to the established strengths of the series with class-leading weather-sealing and exceptionally effective image stabilisation systems. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV At a glance: In the Olympus days, the OM-D range was divided into three distinct lines. The E-M1 cameras were the top-end flagships; the E-M5 models were the mid-range cameras pitched at enthusiasts, and the E-M10 cameras were made for beginners. With its OM-1 and OM-5, OM-System has kept to this structure, indicating that the presumably forthcoming OM-System OM-10 will likely be a beginner model to replace the Mark IV. Only it hasn’t arrived yet. So, for the time being, the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV we’re reviewing here is the best Olympus/OM System camera for beginners. The E-M10 cameras have long been regarded by many photographers, including reviewers at this parish, as being excellent beginner cameras. They offer similar design and features to the E-M5 and E-M1 cameras, but with a simplified, easy-to-use interface that’s excellent for beginners. The previous OM-D E-M10 Mark III scored highly in our review at the time, and the E-M10 IV built on that with a number of sensible upgrades. The sensor resolution was upped from 20MP to 16MP – which is still the standard for OM-System cameras. It may sound a little low compared to the skyrocketing resolutions counts of cameras from other systems, but truthfully, 20MP is plenty for the majority of users, and most people will be just fine with it. The LCD screen has gained the ability to flip down to face the user – useful for vlogging – and built-in Bluetooth provides another connectivity option. Elsewhere, the E-M10 IV gained an improved handgrip and faster burst-shooting speeds. However, the features that really set it apart from other entry-level cameras are a number of interesting computational tricks, which we’ll get into as we examine the camera more closely. Until the OM-System OM-10 shows up, the E-M10 Mark IV is the realistic Olympus/OM-System option for beginners. But does it still hold its own in 2023? Let’s find out as we dig into our Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV review… Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV: Features The E-M10 IV is based around a 20MP sensor, which brings it in line with the rest of the OM-D range in terms of resolution, as well as subsequent OM-System cameras. Paired with the TruePic VIII processor, it provides a sensitivity range of ISO 200-6400 as standard, with extended settings equivalent to ISO 80-25,600 also on hand. However there’s a key difference between this sensor and those in the higher-end E-M5 and E-M1 cameras, because it forgoes on-chip phase detection pixels, relying on contrast detection for autofocus instead. This has little impact if you normally shoot static or slowly moving subjects, but CDAF traditionally fares less well with anything fast or erratic. When the camera was announced, Olympus explained that it had implemented new AF algorithms designed to make the E-M10 IV more competitive in this regard. Autofocus employs 121 points arranged across almost the entire image area. You can either allow the camera to chose the AF area itself, manually select an individual point, or use a cluster of nine, which can be easier when shooting moving subjects. However you don’t get the small AF area or larger groupings found in its more advanced siblings. The E-M10 IV also inherited the eye and face detection algorithms from the then-flagship E-M1 Mark III, which work across a wider range of angles compared to previous generations. Shutter speeds range from 30 seconds to 1/4000sec using the mechanical shutter, or as fast as 1/16,000sec when the silent electronic shutter is employed. Unlike with the previous E-M10 Mark III, the electronic shutter can be used in the more advanced PASM exposure modes, but in standard Olympus fashion it’s confusingly lumped into the drive mode menu, where it’s inexplicably denoted by a small heart symbol. As tends to be the case, continuous shooting speeds depend on the shutter mode. Using the electronic shutter, you can shoot at 15 frames per second with focus fixed at the start of the burst, or at 6.3fps with continuous AF; however this comes with a risk of image distortion due to rolling shutter effects.
        Switch to the mechanical shutter, and these speeds drop to 8.7fps, or 5fps with AFC. If you expect to be shooting bursts regularly, it’s worth getting a fast UHS-II type SD card: using one, I found I could rattle off at least 27 frames at top speed in raw and JPEG before the camera slowed down. Switch down to a lower shooting speed, and the camera will keep going almost indefinitely. One of Olympus’s key technologies, and a tradition upheld in the transition to OM-System, has always been its 5-axis in-body image stabilisation, which works with practically any lens you can fit onto the camera, aside perhaps from very long telephotos. The E-M10 IV’s implementation isn’t as powerful as those on its higher-end siblings, but it still promises 4.5 stops benefit when shooting hand-held. This allows you to keep your ISO setting down in low light, offsetting the noise disadvantage of the smaller sensor, or use slow shutter speeds hand-held for creative motion-blur effects. Switch the mode dial away from the PASM quartet and you’ll find that the E-M10 IV is also packed full of creative options. The auto mode comes with a touchscreen interface that gives a results-oriented approach to changing camera settings, for those who haven’t yet learned the effects of settings such as shutter speed, aperture and white balance. There’s also an array of scene modes designed to allow beginners to tailor the camera to specific subjects, handily laid out in an attractive touch-based interface. Olympus’s Art Filters provide a wide range of image-processing looks, and are sufficiently tasteful that I’d actually consider using them, which isn’t always the case with other brands. Select the AP, or Advanced Photography mode, and you’ll find another interesting set of options, several of which are unique to Olympus. Live Time allows you to watch long exposures develop in real time, taking the guesswork out of what is often an unpredictable process, while Live Composite allows you to build up light trails without overexposing the background. Keystone Compensation enables in-camera corrections of converging verticals, previewed live onscreen. You also get panoramic, silent and multi-exposure modes to play with. Turning our attention to video, the camera can record 4K video at 30fps, or Full HD at up to 60fps. Olympus’s in-body image stabilisation does a good job of keeping hand-held footage steady, and can be supplemented by additional electronic stabilisation, at the expense of a slight field-of-view crop. It’s worth bearing in mind, though, that unlike the majority of its peers, there’s no microphone socket for higher-quality sound. For smartphone connectivity, Olympus has added Bluetooth as well as Wi-Fi. This simplifies the initial setup in the companions app (formerly Olympus Image Share App, now OM Image Share), and in principle enables you to connect to the camera to browse through your image files even when it’s switched off and stored away in a bag. You also get two forms of remote release, one basic and the other with live view and extensive remote control of camera settings. However it’s worth noting that there’s no other form of remote release. Olympus E-M10 IV: Focal points Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV: Build and handling Olympus’s OM-D range is designed to pay homage to the firm’s considerable film heritage, with an attractive retro design that resembles its old 35mm film SLRs. This latest model looks almost exactly the same as its predecessor, just with ‘IV’ picked out in silver on the front of its body. All of the buttons and dials are in the same places, and have the same labels and functions. The result is a charismatic, tactile little camera. While the first two E-M10s employed metal body shells, the Mark IV follows its predecessor in being mostly constructed of plastic; indeed at 383g, it’s even lighter. This might disappoint users of those older models who’d like to upgrade to the 20MP sensor, but it’s no different to its clearest rivals such as the Canon EOS M50, Fujifilm XT-200, Nikon Z 50, Panasonic Lumix G100 or Sony Alpha 6100. Coupled with the compact, retractable 14-42mm kit zoom, it’s extremely compact and portable. One significant change that won’t appear in any spec sheet-based comparison is the redesigned grip, which has a more sculpted profile that provides extra space for your fourth and little fingers to wrap around. This has a remarkably positive effect on the camera’s handling, and combined with the prominent thumb hook it makes the Mark IV surprisingly comfortable to carry one-handed, which can’t always be said for cameras this small. It also makes the camera unusually secure when it’s held in selfie mode. Thanks to a good array of external controls, including twin control dials under your forefinger and thumb, the Mark IV handles unusually well for its class. Everything falls sensibly to hand, and the most important settings generally have their own control. For everything else, pressing a button on
        the camera’s left shoulder brings up onscreen control panels that are tailored for each exposure mode, and which can mostly (if not always) be operated intuitively by touch. To set the focus area, you’re expected to use the touchscreen, even when you’re shooting through the viewfinder. I’m not usually a big fan of this approach, but I find it works well on the E-M10 IV. Alternatively you can press the left key to activate focus area selection, and then use the d-pad. Another change Olympus has made compared to older E-M10 models is to simplify the menus, stripping out many of the more obscure settings and significantly reducing the level of customisation available. You can re-assign the top-plate buttons that are given over to autofocus/autoexposure lock, video recording and the 2x digital zoom, but only from a small list of options. I set the latter to engage magnified view, to aid with achieving precise focus. Like most other cameras at this level, there’s no facility to save custom camera setups for quick recall. One drawback relative to the best of its peers lies with the touchscreen interface. While this supports the most important functions such as selecting the focus area and browsing images in playback, you can’t use it to work through the menus, or change options using the onscreen control panels in the PASM modes. In this respect, it feels like a half-finished job. Olympus E-M10 IV: Viewfinder and screen When it comes to composing your images, the Mark IV employs essentially the same hardware as its predecessors. Its 2.36m-dot electronic viewfinder provides 0.62x magnification, which is pretty much standard at this price point. It previews colour and white balance, along with image brightness across a range covering -3 to +2 stops. Depth of field can be previewed, if you require, by assigning it to a top-plate button. There’s plenty of status information available, along with handy shooting aids such as a dual-axis electronic level and live histogram. One major change, though, comes with the redesign of the rear screen, which can now be flipped down 180° to face forwards beneath the cameras for selfies. This has long been a staple of the film’s simpler PEN cameras, so it’s a surprise Olympus took so long to add it to the E-M10 line. When the screen is in this position the camera engages a selfie assist mode, with onscreen shutter, video and exposure compensation buttons, and the option to engage a three-shot self-timer. It’s a well thought-out system that works very nicely. However the fold-down screen isn’t such a great design for those interested in vlogging, as it gets blocked if you place the camera on a tripod. Olympus E-M10 IV: Autofocus Unlike most of its peers, the E-M10 IV is solely reliant on contrast detection for autofocus. While some might have you believe that this makes the camera unusable, the reality is that it only really matters when you’re shooting fast-moving subjects. The rest of the time, its autofocus is easily up to the task. Indeed with static subjects it’ll focus unerringly accurately in the link of an eye, no matter where in the frame your subject may be. When the camera is confronted with a moving subject, the continuous AF works quite well, in practice. I found that when shooting relatively predictable subjects such as oncoming vehicles, the camera had no trouble maintaining focus while shooting at 5fps. Its hit-rate was rather lower with the more erratic motion of wildlife, but with persistence you’ll still get usable images. One the trade-off for using contrast detection is that the viewfinder blackout time between frames during bursts is noticeably longer compared to PDAF-equipped cameras, which hinders following moving subjects. As usual for Olympus, you also have to remember to select the low shooting speeds to get continuous AF, along with live view between frames. Select high-speed shooting instead and only the first frame is likely to be in focus – if that. Face- and eye-detection has become an increasingly important selling point for cameras, and it works pretty well on the E-M10 IV. It’s capable of understanding faces across a good range of angles, from front-on to near-profile, and at a good range of distances. Again it can handle relatively gentle subject movement with no problem, but it’s not going to be the best option for shooting energetic, erratic children. Olympus E-M10 IV: Performance In practical use, the E-M10 IV is a well-behaved, responsive camera that’s a joy to use. With the 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 EZ kit zoom, it takes a second or so to set itself for shooting when you flick the power on, but much of this is down to the lens extending into position. With other lenses, it’s ready to go almost immediately. During use it responds instantly to both the physical controls and the touchscreen. The camera’s automated systems work very well. Olympus has historically done a great job with metering, auto white balance and colour rendition, and they all
        come together again here to give consistently attractive JPEG output. It’s also easy to judge in the viewfinder when you might want to lighten or darken an image for aesthetic effect, and apply the requisite level of exposure compensation. While it has to be understood that the Four Thirds sensor doesn’t give as good raw image quality compared to APS-C competitors, the 20MP resolution is still more than enough for an A3+ print. At low ISO settings you can pull two or three stops of detail from the shadows when processing raw files, and while you’ll see higher levels of noise at any given ISO compared to its APS-C peers, I’d still be perfectly happy shooting at sensitivities as high as ISO 6400. As usual, Olympus’s in-body stabilisation works extremely well, and you’ll rarely find that an image has been spoiled by camera shake. Unsurprisingly it doesn’t hit the heights achieved by its more expensive siblings, the E-M5 III and E-M1 III, but I was able to get consistently sharp images at shutter speeds down to about 0.8 seconds using the kit zoom towards the middle of its range. As a result, I was able to keep shooting at ISO 200 well after dusk, when I’d have had to start boosting the sensitivity on most other cameras. Olympus’s 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 EZ kit lens is a decent performer, giving sharp images across its full zoom range, along with decent close-up performance. Its slimline design – just 23mm thin when retracted – also makes it a great match to the camera’s design ethos. Its zoom response is unusually well judged for an electronic design too, enabling precise composition with little fuss. However its 28-85mm equivalent range is little uninspiring compared to the 24mm wideangles now provided by most other brands. Olympus E-M10 IV: ISO and noise Olympus used this 20MP Four Thirds sensor in its various forms for several years prior to the release of the E-M10 Mark IV, so it was and is pretty much a known quantity. The E-M10 Mark IV doesn’t throw up any great surprises, either good or bad. Low ISO images show good detail, with noise only starting to impact the image quality visibly at about ISO 800 and above. I’d still happily shoot at up to ISO 6400 if necessary, but would avoid the extended higher settings if possible. Olympus’s default JPEG processing strongly prioritises noise reduction over detail retention, but this can be tamed by turning down the Noise Filter setting. Naturally, you’ll get the very best results by processing raw.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: I recall being surprised when Fujifilm first showed me the X-S10, as those analogue dials for shutter speed and exposure compensation had become such an integral part of the firm’s DNA. But a few years down the line it makes sense; the twin-dial control scheme has been hugely popular among DSLR buyers simply because it works so well on DSLRs, and it works just as well here. As a result, the X-S10 operates in a fashion that will be instantly familiar to DSLR users of all brands. Indeed it probably handles better than many of the cameras that it aspires to replace in photographers’ kit bags, thanks to its uncluttered design and 8-way AF joystick. So if you own an APS-C DSLR and want to switch to a smaller, lighter mirrorless system, quite simply this is the camera for you. In fact, there’s a huge amount to like about the X-S10. It’s compact and lightweight, and gives access to Fujifilm’s superb X-mount lens selection. It’s a joy to use and produces consistently gorgeous images across a wide range of conditions, thanks to one of the best APS-C sensors around. Its autofocus is excellent, and the IBIS acquits itself pretty well too. The only thing that’s missing is weather sealing. Not only is the X-S10 a nicer camera than most of the DSLRs it aims to supplant, it’s also a considerably better option for building a new setup than APS-C mirrorless models from Canon or Nikon, thanks to its IBIS and Fujifilm’s excellent lens range. Compared to Sony’s A6000’s series cameras, it’s just immeasurably more pleasant to use, while delivering more attractive pictures. In short, taking all its features into account, especially its in-body stabilisation, it’s probably the best camera at this price that you can buy right now.

      value: 'Fujifilm X-S10: At a glance The Fujifilm X-S10 was first released towards the tail end of 2020, and came to many as something of a pleasant surprise. Priced towards the low end of the Fujifilm range, it was affordable enough to be an attractive upgrade for DSLR users – and this was clearly who Fujifilm were aiming at. The chunky handgrip and two-dial setup would be instantly familiar to anyone who’d spent a lot of time on a DSLR – and stood out in stark contrast to the dial-laden top plates of cameras like the flagship X-T4 (and, much later, the subsequent X-T5 ). Fujifilm’s other smart play was making the X-S10 a true hybrid camera, with a respectable video spec in addition to its superb stills-shooting capability. Again, this was likely a move to tempt DSLR users who were perhaps chafing against the video limits of their chosen camera. And so, with its simple but effective styling, comprehensive feature-set and relatively affordable price point, the Fujifilm X-S10 proved to be something of a hit. Even today, it makes a credible case for itself as one of the best cameras for beginners , especially when alternatives like the X-T30 II and X-E4 are frequently hard to come by. It took Fujifilm more than two years to take the wraps off the successor to the X-S10. The Fujifilm X-S20 arrived in May 2023, and hews pretty closely to the X-S10’s original DSLR-styled design – indicative of how much Fujifilm got right the first time around. The X-S20 beefs up the battery life, adds sophisticated subject-detection autofocus, and considerably upgrades the video spec. It offers the option to shoot 6.2K footage at 30p or 4K at 60p, compared to a maximum of 4K 30p on the X-S10. Naturally, all this came at a cost, with a price hike of 25% pushing the X-S20 up to $1,299 / £1,249 body-only. This puts the X-S10 in a rather interesting position in 2023. Sure, the X-S20 is a better camera across the board, especially for vloggers, but if you can live without its upgrades, the cheaper X-S10 starts to look like a better bet, especially when you consider the fact that the best Fujifilm X-mount lenses , while fabulous, are not all that cheap. Of course, the fact that the X-S10 has generally held onto its retail price suggests that Fujifilm is well aware there’s still a market out there for this camera. Even if you shop second-hand, you’re only likely to knock $100 / £100 or so off the retail price. With a gorgeous design, in-body image stabilisation (IBIS), a fully articulated screen and satisfying, DSLR-style handling, the Fujifilm X-S10 still offers a lot of the kinds of features you’d find on the best mirrorless cameras , especially for enthusiast photographers. It’s got a much, much better lens range than any APS-C mirrorless effort from Canon or Nikon, it’s more stylish than a Sony, and it’s a good deal cheaper than the Fujifilm X-T4 or X-T5 that sit further up the range, never mind the pro-spec Fujifilm X-H2S and X-H2 . All that sounds rather tempting – but can an almost three-year-old camera still deliver the goods for photographers and videographers in 2023? Our full Fujifilm X-S10 review aims to answer that very question. These days the X-S10 is available body-only, or as part of a lens kit. It can be picked up with the low-cost XC 15-45mm F3.5-5.6 OIS PZ or the XF 18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM OIS (it used to be available as a kit with the XF 16-80mm F4 R OIS WR, but that option now seems to have been discontinued). I’d skip the 15-45mm powerzoom, which is infuriating to use, and go with the nicer XF 18-55mm instead. Fujifilm X-S10: Features With a 26.2MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and X-Processor 4, the X-S10 is built around the same imaging hardware as many other Fujifilm cameras made at the same time. Fujifilm has, however, made some considerable strides since the X-S10 was launched, introducing a high-speed 26MP stacked sensor in the X-H2S and a new 40MP sensor in the X-H2 and X-T5. By recent Fujifilm standards, the technology in the X-S10 is a step behind, though in comparison with APS-C mirrorless cameras from other brands, it still hold up very well indeed. The specification is impressive: its standard sensitivity range of ISO 160-25,600 is expandable to ISO 80-51,200, while shutter speeds range from 15min to 1/4000sec with the mechanical shutter, or up to 1/32,000sec with the silent electronic shutter. As always though, this comes with some risk of rolling shutter artefacts such as image distortion and banding under artificial light, so should be used with caution. Burst shooting is available at 8 frames per second using the mechanical shutter, 20fps with the electronic shutter, or 30fps with a 1.25x crop. Perhaps the biggest casualty of the camera’s price point is its buffer, which at best enables a burst of 23 raw frames at full resolution. However, if you are prepared to shoot JPEG only, which given the quality of Fujifilm’s processing isn’t out of the question, this increases to 105 frames. On-chip phase detection
        supports autofocus anywhere within the frame, with a choice of either 117 or 425 selectable points, along with face and eye detection and subject tracking modes. In fact, you get pretty much the same proven AF system as on its contemporary the Fujifilm X-T4 , including five selectable continuous AF programs for different use cases, along with a sixth user-customisable slot. Fujifilm has downsized its IBIS mechanism compared to the X-T4’s, resulting in a smaller camera body that measures 126 x 85.1 x 65.4mm and weighs 465g. But the system is still rated for between 5.5 and 6 stops of shake reduction with the vast majority of the firm’s lenses. When an optically stabilised lens is mounted it corrects for pitch and yaw, while the IBIS compensates for roll around the lens axis that can cause blurring during long exposures, along with left-right and up-down movements that are problematic when shooting close-ups. One of the biggest attractions of buying into the X system is Fujifilm’s peerless colour science, which is delivered via its Film Simulation settings. These provide a good array of attractive colour looks, ranging from the muted, portrait friendly Pro Neg Std to the vivid, but not excessively in-your-face Velvia. Monochrome users aren’t overlooked, either, thanks to the excellent Acros option. Nicely implemented in-camera raw conversion allows you to apply any of these looks to your images retrospectively after shooting, too. Video can be recorded in 4K at up to 30fps, or Full HD up to 240fps, with no field of view crop. The camera has a stereo microphone socket, while headphones can be connected for monitoring audio via a USB-C adapter that’s included in the box. Along with the in-body stabilisation and fully articulated screen, the X-S10 is a good choice for vloggers, just as Fujifilm intended it to be. Like almost all current cameras, both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are built in for connecting to your smartphone via the free Camera Remote app. You get the option of using your phone as a simple shutter release using Bluetooth, or a comprehensive remote control over Wi-Fi, with a live view display and the ability to change exposure settings. You can also browse your images on either device, and then copy them across to your phone for sharing. One limitation, though, is that unlike some other brands, you can’t activate a connection from the app when the camera is physically switched off, meaning no scrolling through images on your phone when the camera is safely stowed away in your bag. Aside from that, it’s all nicely implemented and generally works well. Fujifilm X-S10: Focal points With its compact design and excellent handling, the X-S10 should appeal strongly to DSLR users looking to downsize their kit. X-mount: Fujifilm offers the best lens line-up of any APS-C system, with 30 optics available covering a range from 12mm to 600mm equivalent. Flash: A tiny built-in flash pops up from the front of the viewfinder housing, released by a switch around the dial on the camera’s left shoulder. There’s also a hot shoe that takes more powerful units. Power: Fujifilm’s familiar NP-W126S is rated to deliver 325 shots. It’s charged in-camera using the USB-C port. Ports: One the left side of the camera you’ll find HDMI and USB-C ports. The latter can also be used to connect headphones for monitoring sound during video recording. Mic/remote: A 3.5mm mic socket is placed high on the camera’s shoulder where it won’t obstruct the screen. It can also be used to connect wired remote releases, but you’ll need a third-party 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter. C modes: New to Fujifilm’s X-series, four user-defined custom camera setups can be saved for rapid retrieval from the mode dial, and given meaningful names Fujifilm X-S10: Build and handling When it comes to build and handling, Fujifilm has done a fine job. The deep handgrip provides a secure hold, which is especially beneficial with moderately large lenses such as the 55-200mm f/3.5-4.8 telezoom. Meanwhile the metal shell confers an impression of quality and robustness that’s becoming rare at this price point. The various buttons and dials all operate with satisfying precision, and during a couple of chilly early winter morning shoots, I found they were all perfectly easy to use with lightweight gloves. It’s worth noting, though, that Fujifilm doesn’t make any specific claims for environmental sealing, so you’ll need to be cautious about using the camera in wet or dusty conditions. All of the main controls are nicely positioned for intuitive operation during shooting. The on/off switch encircling the shutter button enables efficient power management, while the front and rear dials for changing exposure settings are perfectly placed for operation by your forefinger and thumb. Most of the firm’s lenses benefit from dedicated aperture rings, too. Unusually, there’s a third dial on the top left, which by default selects between the Film Simulation modes. I actually enjoyed using it
        for this purpose, but it can be reassigned to a range of other functions if you prefer. When you rotate the dial, pressing the Q Button displays a helpful explanation of what each mode looks like. Instead of a d-pad on the back, Fujifilm has provided a joystick that’s perfectly placed for selecting the focus point and navigating though menus. A small top-plate button sets ISO, another alongside it calls up the onscreen Q Menu, while a third initiates video recording. There’s even a prominent AF-ON button for controlling the autofocus separately from the shutter release. The only oddly placed function is white balance, which is assigned to the button beside the viewfinder eyepiece that looks like it should select between the EVF and LCD. But almost all of the controls can be customised, so I placed white balance onto the video button for easier access. It’s not just the physical controls that are user-customisable, either. The onscreen Q menu can be set to display either 12 or 16 slots, and you can configure it to suit your needs from a huge a range of options. It’s possible to group your most-used menu items into a custom My Menu. In addition, four camera setups can be saved for quick recall via the C1 – C4 positions on the mode dial, and helpfully be given meaningful names, although these are only shown when you press the Q button. Usefully the video position on the mode dial is treated completely separately, with its own independent settings. The overall result is a camera that works really well out of the box, but which you can also refine to suit your specific needs and preferences. Fujifilm X-S10: Viewfinder and screen For composition, Fujifilm has provided a 2.36m-dot electronic viewfinder with 0.62x equivalent magnification and a refresh rate of 100fps, which appears very similar to that in the X-T30. It’s not huge, but it gets the job done perfectly well. You can choose to overlay useful shooting aids such as focus peaking, gridlines, a live histogram, or an electronic level display, and turn them on or off using directional swipes of the touchscreen. As expected, the EVF gives an accurate impression of how your image is going to turn out in terms of colour and white balance, while a half-press of the shutter button previews depth-of-field. Fujifilm has also included a Natural Live View option that aims to mimic the viewfinder experience of a DSLR. This can be really handy in bright, contrasty situations, and I assigned it to the button beside the eyepiece. The viewfinder is joined by a 3in fully articulated screen that’s great for shooting at high or low angles in both portrait and landscape orientations. It offers all the same display options as the viewfinder, so unlike with a DSLR, switching between the two viewing methods is completely seamless. Its touch functions are relatively limited; you can set the focus point, interact with the Q menu and browse through images in playback. But for these purposes, it’s perfectly responsive. Fujifilm X-S10: Autofocus Fujifilm has been using this combination of sensor and processor for some time, developing and enhancing the hybrid autofocus along the way. As a result, the X-S10 inherits an extremely refined and effective AF system. It works really well regardless of whether you prefer to specify the focus point yourself, exploit eye detection for portraits, or use tracking AF with moving subjects. When shooting static subjects, the camera generally focuses quickly, decisively and accurately, and will continue to do so in remarkably low light. Naturally this will be dependent upon the lens used, with some of the firm’s older optics being more sluggish than its recent designs. With its 8-way movement, the joystick provides a rapid way of positioning the focus point exactly where you want it within the frame, and the inherent accuracy of on-sensor AF means that the micro-adjustments often needed when using DSLRs with large-aperture primes are a thing of the past. When shooting portraits, enabling face and eye detection allows the camera to deal with focusing while you concentrate on composition. The AF system can understand faces from a remarkable range of angles, even when they’re fairly small in the frame. It’ll clearly outline the face and eye it’s focusing on, so you know exactly what it’s up to. Switch to subject tracking and continuous autofocus, and the system continues to perform well. Shooting oncoming and retreating trains with the 50-200mm telezoom in dim light, I found that the camera returned a very good percentage of in-focus shots. On those occasions when it did drop slightly out of focus for a few frames, it also tended to pick up again quickly. Fujifilm X-S10: Performance As mentioned earlier, the X-S10 is the sixth model that Fujifilm has built around the same core hardware. This means that the firm now really knows how to get the most out of it. As a result, it’s an extremely well-behaved camera that churns out excellent images with the
        minimum of fuss. I used it across a wide range of conditions, including bright sunlight, a foggy early morning, indoors under fluorescent light, and in vanishingly low light at twilight, and was impressed by how assuredly it handled all of them. Indeed, it’s notable just how consistently its automated systems work. Its metering is generally very well judged, and on the whole, I only adjusted it for aesthetic effect. Its auto white balance is practically foolproof too; with most cameras you can usually get better results when processing raw, but that’s only rarely the case here. Combined with Fujifilm’s excellent film simulations, this means you get consistently attractive JPEGs. I have a particular fondness for the Astia mode for general use, along with Pro Neg Std for portraits and Acros for black & white. It’s one of the few cameras whose files I’d be happy to use directly a lot of the time. Naturally raw is still best when you need to make large tonal adjustments, and at low ISOs it’s possible to lift an impressive amount of shadow detail during processing. Operationally, it’s also a camera that simply gets out of your way while you’re working, allowing you to concentrate on the process of making pictures. Unlike the superficially similarly designed, but cheaper X-T200 (now discontinued), it doesn’t suffer from any operational snags or hold-ups. I must also praise its quiet, refined shutter that shouldn’t draw any unwanted attention. On release, the X-S10 was only Fujifilm’s third camera to feature IBIS, and it still works pretty well. With the optically stabilised 18-55mm f/2.8-4 zoom at wideangle, I was able to get sharp results using shutter speeds down to about half a second, while with the unstabilised 23mm f/2 prime, 1/4sec was more realistic. This provides a genuine advantage over the majority of its APS-C rivals for low-light shooting. However, Fujifilm wasn’t capable of matching the extraordinary multi-second feats offered by the best IBIS systems around, and this discrepancy has only increased a few years down the line, particularly when you compare it to standouts like the OM-System OM-5 . One irritation does come if you want to use manual lenses, either via a mount adapter or native X-mount options from the likes of Laowa or Samyang. For the IS system to work correctly, you need to program in their focal lengths using the Mount Adapter Setting menu, then recall them each time you change lens. Unfortunately. this can’t be assigned to a custom button for rapid access; instead, the best you can do is place it in the My Menu. The camera will accept six focal-length settings, so if you’re crazy enough to want to use a wider range of manual lenses, things get clunkier still. Fujifilm X-S10: ISO and Noise In terms of image quality, unsurprisingly the X-S10 behaves in much the same way as its siblings that use the same sensor. It delivers clean, detailed files at relatively low sensitivities up to about ISO 800, with a little luminance noise then appearing when you crank it up to ISO 1600. Even so, I’d still be perfectly happy to shoot at ISO 3200 and 6400, with the top standard ISO 12,800 setting also being acceptable when lighting conditions are poor. However the extended ISO 25,600 and ISO 51,200 options really suffer, and I’d steer clear of using them. Unusually, if you don’t have to make large tonal adjustments, you’ll get pretty much as good results from camera JPEGs as when processing raw files. Fujifilm X-S10 vs X-S20: which should you buy? The fact that a camera has received an upgraded model doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t worth buying. Its significantly cheaper price tag over the X-S20 ($999 / £929 compared to $1,299 / £1,249) makes the X-S10 a compelling alternative to the newer camera, and depending on your needs and what you like to shoot, you may find yourself gravitating towards the older model. Let’s look at the two compared. The design of the newer Fujifilm X-S20 is pretty similar to that of the X-S10. Once again it favours the two-dial setup that sets it apart from the rest of the Fujifilm range, more closely resembling an APS-C DSLR. Its sensor too is similar – while the X-S20 features an upgraded X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor with a back-illuminated design and the latest X-Processor 5, both cameras have a resolution of 26.1MP. Both cameras also offer the same ISO sensitivity range of ISO 160-12,800 (standard), ISO 80-51,200 (extended). Video is a key upgrade area; if you’re predominantly a video shooter, we’d advise biting the bullet and picking up the X-S20. While the X-S10 puts in a decent showing as a vlogger camera, the X-S20’s improved resolution, recording times and streaming modes make it a lot more future-proof. The X-S20 also benefits from several features that make it a faster action shooter. Its autofocus system offers the latest must-have camera technology: AI-powered subject-detection, meaning it can recognise and lock onto specific subjects. It can be set to recognise
        animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, airplanes, trains, insects and drones. The X-S10’s autofocus, while pretty good, can’t match it. So to sum up: if you’re shooting video as much as or more than stills, you probably want the X-S20. The same goes if you’re planning on using the camera to capture fast-moving subjects such as wildlife. In other cases, however, the cheaper camera may provide you with better value for money.

    - type: conclusion
      value: Canon’s Cinema line-up starts with the EOS R5 C, which has a full-frame sensor, can shoot in 8K raw footage and matches the 120fps 4K shooting. But it also costs £2500 more, and the EOS C70 is even more expensive still. The Fujifilm X-H2S is perhaps the closest competition for the FX30, although they are aimed at different audiences, with the X-H2S more at home amongst hybrid still and video creators. The X-H2S is around the same £2100 price and matches the resolution and frames rates of the FX30, but lacks a few of the more advanced filmmaking features such as LUT inputs and a body specifically designed for building a film rig. Sony’s own APS-C Alpha and ZV range have great video features, but they are designed for vlogging and consumers and are a world apart from the professional features found in the FX30.
    - type: excerpt
      value: "The Sony FX30 is a compact but powerful cinema camera at the price of a regular higher-and APS-C mirrorless camera, and that’s a headline in itself. It uses a 26.2MP APS-C sensor to output 4K video at up to 120fps . It’s essentially an APS-C version of the full-frame FX3, with almost exactly the same body design and specifications. But the smaller sensor brings a significant price saving, not to mention much higher resolution 26-megapixel still images, which makes it a more effective hybrid shooter than the FX3. The Sony FX30 is a bit too video-focused to be considered as one of the best mirrorless cameras right now, but perhaps as one of the best hybrid cameras for mixed stills and video content creation and certainly as one of the best cameras for video for higher-end users. Its combination of professional video features and an affordable price tag make it pretty much unique. Naturally it’s also compatible with the best Sony E-mount lenses , including a number designed for the smaller APS-C format. What distinguishes a cinema camera from a regular camera is a combination of design, interface and digital interfaces. The FX30 shares the same two-tone ‘cinema’ styling of the FX3, its advanced video capture features, its digital interface and external threaded mounting points. You could use the FX30 handheld, but it’s equally suited to mounting in a rig with lights, microphones and external monitors. In February 2021, Sony released the FX3 Cinema camera with a 12.1-million-pixel full-frame BSI CMOS sensor. Arriving six months after the Sony Alpha A7S III , it uses the same sensor and processor and is virtually identical in terms of its shooting features. Externally, though, there are very significant differences, with the FX3 losing the electronic viewfinder, gaining a chunkier body and becoming adorned with 3/4 inch sockets for adding filmmaking accessories. This difference in form factor made it relatively easy for filmmakers and photographers to choose their preferred body style. (Just to confuse things, Sony has also launched an A7S III variant, the Sony ZV-E1 , to join its small but growing line-up of vlogging cameras.) The Sony FX30 is like a lower-cost alternative to the FX3, this time borrowing the body of the FX3 but fitting it with a new 26.1-million-pixel BSI APS-C CMOS sensor. This new sensor and its BIONZ XR processor can shoot at the exact same 4K 120fps resolution as the FX3 and A7S III and match its 4K 60fps 10-bit 4:2:2 capture too. It’s an intriguing addition to the cinema range, which had been moving away from the APS-C or Super35 size sensors for the last few years to full frame versions. The FX30, however, is a clear sign that Sony is still committed to its smaller format E-mount system. It is also intriguing, as the 26.1MP sensor makes it an exciting option for filmmakers who may also want to use the camera for photography. After all, in terms of resolution, this surpasses the 24MP sensors used in Sony’s Alpha APS-C cameras. It’s likely a to be similar sensor to that used by Fujifilm in many of its X-series cameras, just with a conventional Bayer colour filter array, rather than Fujifilm’s X-Trans layout. Costing little more than half the price of the FX3 and about the same as any other high-end APS-C mirrorless camera, the FX30 can be bought with or without a matching audio interface handle. It really is an affordable entry-point in the world of filmmaking. Based on price alone, the FX30 should also be a very appealing prospect to existing Sony Cinema users. But what attraction does it hold at the more entry point of the market? We’re going to look at the camera from the perspective of a photographer who now finds themselves shooting more video and is looking for their first cine camera. Sony FX30: Features The key feature is, of course, the sensor. At 26.1MP, it’s the highest resolution APS-C sensor in Sony’s line-up. It’s interesting that it should first see use in the FX30 ahead of a A6000 series camera. The sensor is backside illuminated (BSI), meaning the circuitry is on the back of the sensor. However, it is not stacked, where the processing circuit is attached directly to the sensor to improve data read speed. Inevitably this does have an impact on rolling shutter performance. Sony introduced its E mount with the NEX-3 and NEX-5 in 2010 . Both these cameras had APS-C sensors, and it has now been 12 years that Sony has been producing lenses for this mount for both full-frame and APS-C sensors. Sony has recently updated its APS-C lens line-up with the addition of the E 11mm F1.8, E 15mm F1.8 G and E PZ 10-20mm F4 G lenses , and I used the latter two during my time with the FX30. There is an abundance of lenses that can be used with the FX30, and the camera may in fact give a new lease of life to Sony’s APS-C E mount lenses. This is where Sony’s APS-C mirrorless ecosystem currently has a clear advantage over Nikon and especially Canon. In photographic terms, in some ways\
        \ the camera is everything you would expect, and yet in others it’s lacking. The sensor has a sensitivity range of ISO 125 to 32,000 , extending to ISO 102,400 when shooting still images. You can shoot in raw and JPEG using the full 26.1MP resolution. There are all the autofocus features you could want, including Animal and Bird AF . However, when it comes to continuous shooting features, there aren’t any. The FX30 only offers single shot stills. It also has no mechanical shutter, which may not be ideal for shooting fast subjects, and as a result, it has no flash options. There is no doubt that the camera is part of Sony’s Cinema rather than its Alpha line-up. There is nowhere near enough room here to go into the entirety of the cinema specifications of the FX30, so we’ll tackle the headline features and the ones that I feel make it an exciting camera for first-time filmmakers. The highest resolution that FX30 can shoot is 4K at up to 120fps or Full HD at 240fps . This is ideal for those who want to shoot slow motion, as is currently the trend with many ‘Cinematic’ style YouTube videos. Perhaps more important is the quality that can be achieved for more standard frame rates, with 4K 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording . Those who want to push what the camera can do can take advantage of the camera’s full-size HDMI output to record 16-bit raw footage to an external recorder such as the Atomos Ninja V. As you would expect, a wealth of Sony Picture Profiles can be applied, including S-Log, which will help achieve the maximum 14-stop dynamic range from the camera. As with the recent firmware 2.00 upgrade for the FX3 and the Sony Alpha 7S III, you can also upload LUT (Look Up Table) profiles to the camera. These can be applied directly to S-log3 footage so you can achieve any number of cinematic looks and hard-bake them directly into your footage. This is great for those who want a quick workflow – you can use LUTS from your favourite creators to mimic their style or create your own. Here’s a demo of how to upload and use LUTs: Alternatively, you can preview what the LUT will look like to help get an accurate exposure and apply it to the S-log footage when you edit the footage on your computer. For those who don’t want to delve too deep into colour grading, Sony’s S-Cinetone profile is always available, which I used almost exclusively whilst testing the camera. One key feature is the Steadyshot stabilisation. The FX30 has a 5-axis stabilised sensor and can also take advantage of optically stabilised lenses . This can then be made even more efficient with Active Steadyshot, which dynamically changes the area of the sensor being sampled to compensate for movement at the expense of a slight decrease in the field of view. I found the stabilisation very impressive, but it is worth noting that Active stabilisation can’t be used when shooting at 100/120fps. There is also the ability to load the footage into Sony’s Catalyst Browse software and apply stabilisation in-post using gyroscope data captured by the camera. Again, this comes at the expense of the field of view, but with some say over how extreme you want the stabilisation/crop to be. It does, however, involve another software/production step. One handy feature that the FX30 has that the FX3 doesn’t is breathing compensation , where the image frame is dynamically changed to retain the same field of view when a lens is focused. You can see this setting in action in the short demonstration clip below. Breathing can also be suppressed in post-production using Sony Catalyst Browser software. In terms of audio, there are 3.5mm mic and headphone sockets built in. There’s also an optional audio interface handle which slides onto the Multi Interface hotshoe on the top of the camera and then bolts into place using two 3/4 inch screws, via the 3/4in sockets on the camera’s top plate. As well as being able to mount a microphone, it adds two XLR sockets and the corresponding gain controls for 4-channel audio. It is an excellent addition for professional filmmakers, in line with the top-end film cameras and their audio inputs. Still, those starting may be better suited to using a Rode VideoMic Pro or Sony’s own ECM-B10 mic. Sony FX30: Key features Sony FX30: Build and Handling As previously stated, the FX30 is almost identical to the FX3 body. Obviously, the name badge is different, and the FX3 also has a ‘Full Frame’ destination under the lens mount. All 3/4 inch sockets and the strap lugs are now anodised black, whereas, on the FX3, they are bare metal. The other less noticeable external change is the FX30’s omission of the IR remote receiver on the handgrip and the removal of the self-timer LED, with this task now achieved by using the camera’s tally light. It would be somewhat unfair to describe the FX30 as a brick, but it is a chunky cuboid with a handgrip. It’s unwieldy compared to a still camera, but as a filmmaking camera, it is the ideal barebones setup, particularly\
        \ with the 5 points where filmmakers can add accessories. Although the option is there with many FX3 cages available, you can happily use the camera without needing a cage to add accessories. The layout isn’t dissimilar from what you would find on a Sony Alpha body, but there are a few quirks. The power switch is no longer near the shutter button, but is on the top left of the camera’s rear. Instead, around the shutter is a zoom control. This is great if you’re using power zoom lenses such as the APS-C ones that Sony has released recently. It allows you to zoom the lenses in and out without touching them. Thankfully the menu of the FX30 is the latest Sony Alpha version, so the same as the FX3, A7S III, A7 IV etc. Navigating the menu is very straightforward, and it is handy that you can also use the articulated touchscreen to select menu items – you don’t have to rely on the control dial and buttons. Overall, the camera feels well built and solid in hand. It has an unspecified level of weather-sealing, and I did find myself using it briefly in light rain with no issues. The camera is a workhorse. Sony FX30: Performance In the short time I had the camera before its launch, it hasn’t been possible to delve into every facet and feature. So I’ve concentrated on how the camera is used in practice and the features I have enjoyed using. There is a massive amount of internal recording options, but the quality of the 25fps 4K 10-bit 4:2:2 footage is excellent. It is at the more standard 24, 25, 30, 50 and 60fps rates that the image is created from 6k downsampling, so for lowest noise and best detail, this is where you want to be shooting. There are many other creative options for those who want to get footage off the camera straight on to an editing timeline. For example, the S&Q (Slow and Quick) options of shooting up to 240fps in FullHD or creating timelapse footage, which you can see in action in the video below. But there are other not so obvious ways that you can employ the technology in the camera to shooting creatively. I found it was great being able to control the camera over Wi-Fi via Sony Imaging Edge software. I set the camera up to film garden birds, and then could happily start and stop recording from my laptop in the comfort of my house. Being able to record remotely like this is something we think about as photographers, but being able to do it when shooting video opens up many other creative options. Image stabilisation was impressive. I used the Active stabilisation with a Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG DN OS lens and a monopod. This actually isn’t recommended by Sony, who say it should be used up to 200mm. With the 1.5x crop, the 400mm became equivalent to 600mm, and I then used the 1.5x Clear Image Zoom to give it the same field of view as a 900mm lens, which is ridiculous. You can see this in action in the video below: first showing the camera’s screen, then the footage captured in this mode. \uFEFF Even more ridiculous is that the Animal AF worked at this focal length with a third party lens. The FX30 may become a firm favourite amongst wildlife filmmakers who can take advantage of the camera’s size and the benefit of the 1.5x crop factor on those full-frame lenses. Here’s a clip showing Animal Eye AF in action: There isn’t much to say about the AF that hasn’t been said before. With 90% phase detection coverage, the FX30 comfortably tracks subjects around the frame, and Human, Animal and Bird AF are all welcome additions. It always seems like witchcraft to see them working. Touchscreen AF also works flawlessly, especially after I reduced the AF speed to produce smooth focus pulls using the touchscreen. Again, this technology has been tried and tested in the last couple of generations of Sony cameras and is constantly refined. For the best quality footage, the standard frame rates of 24, 25 or 30fps are advised without using Clear Image Zoom. These use the oversampled 6K footage and reduce it to 4K to keep noise to a minimum. And the Dual Base sensitivities of ISO 800 and 2500 keep footage clean even in low light. You do have to be careful if you are shooting in the higher frame rates, as there is an impact on noise levels in the shadow areas. But in reality, if you are sharing the video, online sites such as YouTube and especially Facebook will compress the image so much that it will serve to reduce noise further. Again, stick to below 60fps, keep the sensitivity as low as possible and you’ll be rewarded with crisp 4K footage."

      value: The X-H2S is a pro-spec, high-speed flagship designed to tempt users of high-end APS-C DSLRs into the Fujifilm fold. Andy Westlake puts it through its paces
    - type: conclusion
      value: Fujifilm is the only company that’s taking APS-C mirrorless seriously at the moment, in terms of both camera design and lens range. With the X-H2S it’s really driven this point home, creating a truly high-performance, pro-spec model that’s especially suitable for sports, wildlife, and action shooting. Crucially, it’s backed up by a comprehensive range of top-notch lenses. In contrast, Sony’s A6000-series bodies are outdated and nasty to use, while Canon and Nikon’s APS-C cameras are much less capable and suffer from extremely limited matched lens line-ups. The only real competition comes from Micro Four Thirds, but neither the OM System OM-1 nor the Panasonic GH6 offers quite as high performance as the X-H2S. Perhaps the real attraction of the X-H2S becomes clear when you use it with long lenses such as the 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 or the 150-600mm f/5.6-8. You get breathtaking shooting speeds in a relatively lightweight package that’s easy to use hand-held, and which offers impressive telephoto reach at a much lower price than a comparable full-frame kit. And while you may well not need 40fps very often, it’s an impressive option to have available. Naturally Fujifilm users may be tempted to go for the more affordable and higher resolution X-T5, a camera that can shoot at 20fps with its electronic shutter and also has subject detect AF. You can’t, of course, ignore the price. The X-H2S is without doubt the most capable APS-C camera yet made, but at $2,499 / £2,499 body-only, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, this reflects the fact that the added complexity of stacked sensors makes them more expensive. If you want the extra speed and performance, you’ve got to pay for it. In the full-frame world, that would mean shelling out $4,500 / £4,000 on the Sony Alpha 9 II, not to mention larger and heavier lenses to get the same telephoto reach. So in these terms, the X-H2S is arguably cheap for what it offers. It’s a sensational camera that offers remarkable performance in a smaller and more affordable package than its full-frame competitors.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Fujifilm X-H2S is a pro-spec, high-speed flagship designed to tempt users of high-end APS-C DSLRs into the Fujifilm fold. Andy Westlake puts it through its paces to find out if it’s the best Fujifilm camera . Fujifilm X-H2S at a glance: Fujifilm launched the X-H1 in early 2018. It was the firm’s first camera to feature in-body stabilisation and very much targetted at the photo/video hybrid market. While it proved a capable performer, it faced fierce competition from within its own ranks, notably the X-T3 , a smaller and more charismatic camera that featured Fujifilm’s next generation 26.2MP BSI CMOS X-Trans sensor offering improved image quality. The X-H2S is equipped with an impressive line-up of hybrid features, and again it faces internal rivalry, from the X-H2 and the X-T5 , both introduced a matter of months after the X-H2S. This time, however, the points of difference are clearer, so the chances of the 26.2MP X-H2S’s sales being canniibalised are much lower, with both the X-H2 and X-T5 boasting BSI but not stacked 40MP sensors. The X-H2S is pro-spec flagship model designed for shooting sports and action . It introduces the firm’s latest sensor, which is still 26.2MP in resolution, but now employs stacked technology for rapid shooting at up to 40 frames per second . Without doubt, the X-H2S is the most ambitious APS-C camera we’ve yet seen. It’s clearly trying to tempt photographers currently using high-end APS-C format DSLRs such as the Canon EOS 7D Mark II or Nikon D500 , who appreciate the advantages the smaller format has to offer but don’t see a suitable mirrorless successor in those firm’s current line-ups. Even the impressively spec’ed Canon EOS R7 is a significant step down in terms of speed, build quality and price at $1,400 / £1,449 body only. It’ll come as no surprise to hear that this technology comes with a significant price tag. At $2,499 / £2,499 body-only , the X-H2S is in the price ball-park of impressive full-frame all-rounders such as the Canon EOS R6 Mark II ($2,499 / £2,779 body only) and the Sony Alpha 7 IV ($2498 / £2399). However, neither can match the X-H2S’s sheer speed. Another alternative is the excellent OM System OM-1 , which is even faster but uses a smaller 20MP Micro Four Thirds sensor, for $1,999 / £1,979. As a result, the X-H2S promises a unique combination of speed and image quality for the price. Alongside the X-H2S, Fujifilm announced two lenses that say a lot about what the firm sees the camera as being best used for. The XF 18-120mm f/4 LM PZ WR is designed as a general purpose optic for video/stills hybrid shooters with a power zoom design. Meanwhile the XF 150-600mm f/5.6-8 R LM OIS WR is a long telephoto for sports, wildlife and other action photography. Read more about these lenses here. Fujifilm X-H2S: Features Let’s take a closer look at the X-H2S’s main specs. Its 26.2MP stacked sensor is designated X-Trans CMOS 5 HS . As the name suggests, it uses the firm’s unique X-Trans colour filter array which is designed to suppress colour moiré. Paired with Fujifilm’s X-Processor 5, it offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 160-12,800 , which is extendable to ISO 80-51,200 . It’s worth noting that the expanded settings aren’t available when using Auto ISO. The headline 40fps shooting is available in full resolution raw when using the silent electronic shutter, complete with autofocus and autoexposure tracking, and with a 140-frame buffer . Switch to the mechanical shutter, and it’ll keep shooting at 15fps until either the power or card space runs out. No other APS-C or full-frame model can match this, and while the OM-1 shoots even faster, it won’t keep going for as long. The stacked CMOS sensor design enables a scan time as 1/150sec for stills, and 1/180sec for video, to minimise rolling shutter distortion. Turning our attention to autofocus, Fujifilm’s innovative AI subject detection can recognise and focus specifically on animals, birds, cars, motorbikes, airplanes, or trains , with subject selection available via the onscreen quick menu. Like Fujifilm’s previous models, the X-H2S can also detect and focus on human faces and eyes . Thanks to the sensor’s rapid 120fps readout speed, the camera can also take autofocus readings more frequently, promising greater accuracy. Another key feature is 5-axis in-body stabilization that’s rated for 7 stops of shake reduction, and which works in co-operation with optically stabilised lenses. Unlike the firm’s GFX models, the IBIS system doesn’t support a high-resolution multi-shot mode, but that’s not surprising with a camera that’s much more focused towards sports and action shooting. Additional electronic stabilisation is on offer for video shooting. Fujifilm’s excellent Film Simulation modes are on board for in-camera colour processing, providing an array of attractive looks. These range from the Velvia mode that’s a favourite for landscapes, though to the more muted ProNeg options that are great for portraits.
        Meanwhile monochrome lovers should appreciate the Acros mode. The firm has also included the option to output processed files as HEIF rather than JPEG, which promises the extra flexibility of 10-bit colour but currently enjoys limited software support. When it comes to connectivity, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both built in. As usual, you can connect the camera to your phone and transfer images across for further editing or sharing. You can also use your phone as a remote control, complete with a live vie feed and the ability to change the most important shooting settings. There’s also a simple shutter release option via Bluetooth, which is really handy yet surprisingly uncommon. Optional VG-XH vertical grip The firm will also be offering a matched VBG-XH vertical battery grip ($399 / £399), which includes a duplicate set of controls for portrait-format shooting. Like Fujifilm’s other grips it holds two more batteries, effectively tripling the camera’s stamina. It also features the firm’s boost mode switch, which enables you to either speed up the camera’s performance at the expense of battery life, or engage Eco mode to get more shots per charge. An FT-HX network grip , which includes a built-in ethernet socket and support tethering to a 5G mobile device for file transfer, is also available for the X-H2S, but it costs $999 /£949. Fujifilm X-H2S: Video features Video specs are just as advanced. The camera is capable of internal recording in 6.2K resolution at 30fps, 4K at 120fps, or Full HD at 240fps; all with 4:2:2 10-bit colour. It can output either ProRes or BMD raw to an external recorder, via its full-size HDMI port. Subject detection AF is available during video recording, and Flog2 output promises 14 stops of dynamic range. Fujifilm also claims that the X-H2S can keep recording for an extended time of up to 4 hours at 25 °C. Optional FAN-001 cooling fan To avoid over-heating and enable extended recording at higher ambient temperatures, the add-on FAN-001 cooling fan is available for $199 / £169. This simply bolts onto the back via two large screws, so you don’t have to put up with the added bulk all the time. However, once it’s installed the screen can’t fold in, and is left sticking awkwardly out the side until you take the cooling unit off again. Fujifilm X-H2S: Key features Fujifilm X-H2S: Build and handling One area where the X-H2S stands out in Fujifilm’s range lies with its control layout. As it’s aiming to attract users of high-end APS-C DSLRs, it’s designed to look approachable and familiar to current Canon and Nikon users. So, rather than use analogue dials and switches like its predecessor, the X-H2S employs a purely electronic control scheme. Instead of top-plate shutter speed and ISO dials, the X-H2 boasts twin control dials for changing exposure settings, which are set beneath your forefinger and thumb (there’s also an aperture ring on all of the firm’s XF lenses). You also get a conventional e xposure mode dial , an AF-area joystick , and a large monochrome top-plate LCD showing key settings. Other buttons are dedicated to AF mode, ISO, and white balance, while the Q button brings up a customisable on-screen quick menu for setting everything else. One of the advantages of this approach is that it allows much greater customisability of the camera to suit different users or shooting scenarios, both stills and video. Almost every button and dial can be customised, and no fewer than seven setups can be assigned to C positions on the mode dial to cover different shooting scenarios, either for stills or video. These setups can even be given meaningful names, although unhelpfully, they’re only displayed when you press the Q button. In the hand, the X-H2S is certainly a robust-feeling camera, with its large, comfortable handgrip and weather-sealed magnesium-alloy construction. Its deep grip provides secure handling with larger telephoto lenses such as the Fujifilm XF 100-400mm F4.5-5.6 R LM OIS WR or the XF 150-600mm F5.6-8 R LM OIS WR . The key controls all fall nicely to hand, and once you’ve got a feel for where everything lies, it’s quick and efficient to operate. Indeed, current DSLR users should feel right at home. However, I must admit I found it a little soulless compared to the X-T5’s beguiling array of analogue dials and switches, which brings a more engaging shooting experience. But that’s a very subjective opinion. Fujifilm X-H2S: Viewfinder and screen Fujifilm has equipped the X-H2S with an electronic viewfinder that offers 5.76m-dot resolution, 0.8x magnification and up to 120fps refresh rate. It’s one of the best viewfinders I’ve used, providing a bright, clear view right into the corners of the frame. It’s only surpassed by the 9.4m-dot, 0.9x unit found in the much more expensive Sony Alpha 1 and A7S III. By default, Fujifilm previews colour processing live in the viewfinder, along with exposure across a +/-3 EV range. Half-press the shutter button and the aperture stops down
        to its set value, previewing depth of field. As usual, compositional aids such as gridlines and a dual-axis electronic level are available, with the latter toggled on or off via a button on the front. There’s also a Natural Live View option, which switches off all the processing to provide an experience more akin to using an optical viewfinder. For movie makers, a Log Assist option aids when shooting with a flat log profile, showing a more natural rendition of the scene. Either of these modes can be toggled on or off using a function button. Fujifilm also offers a uniquely useful array of boost options. These allow you to prioritise the live view feed for resolution, low-light performance, battery economy, or a high frame rate to render fast motion smoothly. Crucially, these modes are made easy to access by pressing the ‘down’ key of the d-pad, unlike on other cameras, which generally require a trip into the menus. They can also be specified within custom shooting memories. The rear screen is excellent, too. It’s a 3-inch, 1.62m-dot touchscreen of the side-hinged, fully articulated type. It can be set to face in almost any direction, which means it’s great for overhead or ground-level shooting, in both portrait and landscape format. Personally, I still prefer the X-H1’s triple-hinged design for shooting stills, as it’s quicker to use and stays in-line with the lens. But the big advantage of the X-H2S’s screen in comparison is that it can be set facing forwards for self-recording. Fujifilm X-H2S: Autofocus When it comes to ‘conventional’ autofocusing, the X-H2 S performs extremely well. There’s a choice between either 117 selectable focus points in an 13×9 grid, or 425 in a 25×17 array. The latter is naturally more precise in terms of where focus can be set, but slower to navigate. A combination of on-sensor phase detection and contrast detection results in fast and accurate focus, wherever the subject might be in the frame. Clearly, though, with the X-H2S we’re really interested in how well Fujifilm’s new subject detection system works. This enables the camera to recognise and autofocus on animals, birds, cars, motorbikes, airplanes, or trains. It’s one of those features where, if you haven’t tried it, you’ll probably wonder what all the fuss is about. Then, once you’ve used it for fast-moving action, you may decide you can’t live without it. Subject recognition is controlled from its own section of the Q Menu, separately from (human) face and eye detection. However, the two are mutually exclusive; engage one, and the camera turns off the other. You can specify whereabouts in the frame the camera should start looking for a subject using the joystick, even when using the wide/tracking AF area mode. If there are multiple possible subjects in the frame, you can (in principle) select between them in the same way, although this isn’t always practical in rapidly changing situations. Once the camera finds a subject of the selected type, it’ll outline it in green in the viewfinder and then proceed to follow it around the frame. The system is sufficiently smart to attempt to focus on the most important part of a subject, outlining increasingly specific sections as they become larger and clearer. With an animal, this will be the body, then the head, and finally an eye; with a plane, it’ll be the nose. If no subject of the specified type is detected, the camera will revert to conventional AF tracking based on colour, pattern, and distance, which also works very well. I found subject detection did a good job of identifying cars, birds, or animals reliably even when they’re distant and small in the frame, and then following them accurately. It’s not foolproof, though. With low contrast subjects the camera has a certain tendency to shift focus onto the background, especially if it’s detailed and close to the subject (such as with a bird perched in a tree). Using the default settings, the system also seems to be quite easily distracted when the subject disappears briefly behind an obstacle, although in principle, this could be addressed using the AF-C custom settings menu. My overall impression is of a system that’s not quite as reliable out of the box as those from Sony or Canon, but which is still likely to give better results than simple AF tracking. Fujifilm X-H2S: Performance Like other cameras with stacked sensors, the X-H2S is noticeably just that bit faster and nimbler than its peers. It starts up almost immediately when you flick the power switch, and then responds instantly to all the physical controls. The only time it ever feels laggy is when trying to operate the Q Menu by touch; on several occasions I found myself tapping away at the touchscreen and getting no response for a second or two. But otherwise, it’s every bit as slick and refined as a professional model should be. It’s also very quiet. The mechanical shutter operates with just a soft clack, while the electronic shutter is inherently silent. The
        camera allows you to play a pre-recorded shutter sound to provide audible feedback that you’re actually taking pictures, which can be especially useful during burst shooting. Fujifilm’s metering and auto white balance are both reliably excellent, and usually only need to be adjusted for creative purposes. The viewfinder also gives a very accurate preview of how the finished image will look, which makes it particularly easy to judge how much exposure compensation you may need to apply to achieve a desired effect. The Film Simulation modes give as attractive colour as always – I generally left the camera set to Astia/Soft by default, switching on occasion to the other options for specific looks. Fujifilm’s in-body stabilisation works well, and I was able to get sharp images hand-held at shutter speeds as slow as 0.6sec when using the 16-55mm f/2.8 zoom at wide-angle. This is on a par with cameras like the Sony Alpha 7 IV, although it’s some way off class-leading Micro Four Thirds models such as the Panasonic Lumix GH6 and OM System OM-1 . More to the point, it means that your hand-held images shouldn’t be affected by camera shake in most situations, with subject motion blur more likely to be a problem. At the other extreme of the focal-length range, a combination of effective stabilisation and the extra reach afforded by APS-C means you can easily hand-hold long telephoto zooms such as the 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 and 150-600mm f/5.6-8, with the latter giving a remarkable 900mm equivalent view. In my tests, the camera matched its specified continuous shooting speeds, shooting in raw at 40fps for 140 frames before it started to stutter. Drop the frame rate to 15fps, and it’ll keep on going indefinitely. You’ll need to use a CFexpress card to achieve this, though, and not surprisingly the performance drops with an SD card. If you make the mistake, as I did, of inserting a UHS-I card and inadvertently directing a high-speed burst to it, be prepared for the camera to lock up for a painfully long time as it clears the buffer. One oddity is that by default, the exposure is fixed at the start of a burst. This can be problematic for shooting outdoors on sunny days when the subject may be moving rapidly between light and shade. To get the camera to continuously adjust exposure between frames requires navigating the labyrinthine menus to find the ‘Shutter AE’ setting (Set-up menu, Button/Dial Setting), and then counter-intuitively, turning it Off. On a more positive note, though, I saw no obvious disadvantage to shooting with the electronic shutter in terms of rolling shutter distortion. Raw image quality is every bit as good as we’d expect. Older stacked sensors perhaps lacked a little in terms of dynamic range compared to their conventional counterparts, but that’s no longer really the case. There’s scope to boost shadow detail in the X-H2S’s raw files by at least four stops before noise becomes at all problematic. It’s perhaps not quite up with the best full-frame cameras, but it should be sufficient fo most purposes, especially when augmented by AI noise reduction software. Fujifilm X-H2S: ISO and Noise In terms of image quality, the X-H2S behaves in much the same way as its 26.2 MP siblings. It delivers clean, detailed files at lower sensitivities up to about ISO 800, with a little luminance noise then appearing when you crank it up to ISO 1600. Even so, I’d still be perfectly happy to shoot at ISO 6400, with the top standard ISO 12,800 setting also being acceptable when lighting conditions are poor. However, the extended ISO 25,600 and ISO 51,200 options aren’t brilliant, and I’d steer clear of using them. If you don’t have to make large tonal adjustments, you’ll get pretty much as good results from camera JPEGs as when processing raw files.'

      value: The 40MP Fujifilm X-H2 is the highest resolution APS-C format camera ever and it's very ably supported by impressive autofocus, drive and video features. Andy Westlake and Joshua Waller are the lucky guys who got to test this flagship picture-taking machine
    - type: conclusion
      value: To an extent, the X-H2 has been a known quantity ever since Fujifilm announced it was in development. The handling is identical to the X-H2S, the AF system works in just the same way with an advanced subject detection system, and the 40MP files contain plenty of detail. Like other high-resolution cameras, it’s worth noting that in order to get the best detail and image quality, you’ll need to pay attention to the quality of the lenses you use. Whilst we used a recommended lens, the 16-55mm f/2.8, it was clear to see that by using a prime lens we were able to capture sharper and more detailed images. This is, of course, most noticeable when ‘pixel peeping’ and will benefit those interested in cropping or shooting detailed landscapes and other still life images, or where additional resolution and detail is of particular importance. Noise performance is impressive, considering the increase in megapixels (and smaller pixels), and of course, the camera delivers Fujifilm’s trademark colour reproduction which has won them many fans. There’s also the appeal of the 8K video mode, and if you’re looking to step up to 8K video recording without spending $4,000 / £4,000+, then the Fujifilm X-H2 is well worth considering as it offers incredible value for money. However, if this isn’t needed, then Fujifilm as doing an impressive job of offering cameras suitable for all use cases, for example, high-speed shooting is catered for with the 26MP Fujifilm X-H2S , high-resolution by the 40MP X-H2, and for general shooting where you don’t need the additional speed of the X-H2S, or the resolution of the X-H2, then the 26MP Fujifilm X-T4 offers an even more affordable option, whilst still offering a 26MP sensor, and high-speed shooting (up to 30fps cropped). For those looking for a modern, progressive, and well-supported system, the range of Fujifilm X-series cameras is particularly impressive, with price points to suit almost all people, and with this, you get access to an impressive range of lenses, from affordable primes, to long telephoto zooms. What more could you want?
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Fujifilm X-H2 is Fujifilm’s high-resolution 40MP APS-C X-series camera, and as such is the highest resolution APS-C camera of all time, but how does it perform? Find out in our full review. Fujifilm X-H2 at a glance: In May 2022, Fujifilm launched the X-H2S , a high-speed 26.2MP mirrorless model capable of shooting at 40 frames per second. At the time, the firm promised that it would introduce a 40MP version of the camera in September. True to its word, Fujifilm has now revealed the Fujifilm X-H2 , which places a 40MP back-illuminated sensor into the same body design. Strikingly, this new high-resolution model costs rather less than its high-speed sibling, at $1,999 / £1,879 body-only (compared to $2,499 / £2,499), or $2,499 / £2,249 in a kit with the XF 16-80mm f/4 R OIS WR lens. Fujifilm X-H2: Features Like its twin, the X-H2 is designed for serious enthusiast and professional photographers . But it’s better suited for uses where detail capture is more important than outright speed, such as studio or landscape work. Not that it’s a slouch, by any means; it can still shoot at 15 frames per second in full resolution raw, or 20 fps using the silent electronic shutter (with 1.29x crop), which comes with a mind-boggling world-record fastest speed of 1/180,000sec . However, the electronic shutter also brings a greater risk of artefacts such as rolling shutter distortion or banding under artificial light, compared to the X-H2S with its stacked sensor and faster readout. Thanks to the inclusion of the latest X-Processor 5, the camera also boasts Fujifilm’s AI-based subject detection autofocus system that can recognise humans, animals, birds or various types of vehicle. Alternatively, there’s a choice of using either 117 or 425 manually selectable focus points. The sensitivity range still covers a range from ISO 125 up to 51,200 , despite the increase in megapixels, and therefore smaller pixels. The 5-axis in-body stabilisation (IBIS) promises up to 7 stops of shake correction , and when the camera is used with lenses with optical image stabilisation (OIS) this can work in conjunction with the IBIS for enhanced stabilisation. With the X-H2, Fujifilm has introduced a high-resolution multi-shot mode, that can give images up to 160MP, however, these, like the GFX series, aren’t processed in-camera, and instead need to be stitched together later on your computer. It’s also worth noting, that due to the X-Trans sensor’s colour filter arrangement, the camera has to take a total of 20-shots for this to work, rather than the 16-shots needed for similar Bayer sensor systems. There are dual card slots for recording files, with one accepting CFexpress Type B cards and the other, UHS-II SD media. Power is provided by Fujifilm’s familiar NP-W235 battery, which promises 680 shots per charge (economy) . Videographers are well served too , with the X-H2 offering 8K output at 30fps , 4K at 60fps, or Full HD at 240 fps, all in 10-bit 4:2:2 colour. ProRes recording is supported internally, while either ProRes or BlackMagic raw can be output over HDMI. The camera is said to offer up to 12+ stops of dynamic range (DR) with F-Log, and up to 13+ stops of DR with F-Log2, 1 stop less than the Fujifilm X-H2S . Microphone, headphone and full-size HDMI ports are all on board. There’s no hard limit to the recording time, with Fujifilm promising 160 minutes continuous 8K30P at 25 °C Fujifilm’s renowned Film Simulation modes are on board for in-camera colour processing, providing an array of pleasing looks. These range from the Velvia mode that’s a favourite for landscapes, through to the more muted ProNeg options that are ideal for portraits. Meanwhile monochrome fans will appreciate the Acros mode. The camera has also included the option to output processed files as HEIF rather than JPEG, which promises the extra flexibility of 10-bit colour but enjoys limited software support currently. When it comes to connectivity, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both built in. As usual, you can connect the camera to your phone and transfer images across for further editing or sharing. You can also use your phone as a remote control, complete with a live view feed and the ability to change most shooting settings. There’s also a simple shutter release option via Bluetooth, which is really useful, yet surprisingly still relatively uncommon. Fujifilm X-H2: Features The X-H2 is, as expected, compatible with all the same accessories as the X-H2S. This includes the FAN-001 cooling fan that facilitates extended video recording in warm conditions, and the VG-XH vertical grip, which adds a duplicate set of controls for portrait-format shooting, while housing two extra batteries for extended shooting times. Fujifilm has also now officially introduced the FT-XH File Transmitter Grip, which adds an array of pro-spec connectivity options. This includes high-speed 150Mbps Wi-Fi, an Ethernet port, and a USB-C port for smartphone tethering. It’s priced at $999 / £949.
        Fujifilm X-H2: Design and handling In terms of its physical design, the X-H2 is identical to its faster twin the X-H2S, with the most visible difference being the ‘S’ emblazoned on the front of the latter. This is no bad thing, as I found the X-H2S handled extremely well when I reviewed it . However, it’s worth reiterating that unlike Fujifilm’s other premium X-system cameras, the X-H2 is based around an entirely electronic control scheme , rather than the analogue dials and switches that are a hallmark of the X-T and X-Pro lines. So, you get a conventional exposure mode dial with no fewer than seven programmable ‘C’ positions, customisable for stills or video. There are twin electronic dials for changing exposure settings, and a joystick on the back for selecting the AF point. The body is dotted with function buttons, almost all of which are customisable to suit your way of shooting. You also get quick access to settings using the Q (Quick) button. The X-H2 feels very well-built in your hand, with a large comfortable handgrip, and weather-sealed magnesium-alloy construction. It’s entirely identical to the X-H2S, and if you’ve tried that, and like it, then you’ll like the X-H2. For those looking for a more compact mirrorless camera body, then the X-T4, and models like the X-S10 and X-S20 offer smaller options, but of course with entirely different specifications. The larger grip helps with a more secure hold, and this is particularly useful for larger telephoto lenses, such as the Fujifilm XF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 R LM OIS WR or the XF 150-600mm f/5.6-8 R LM OIS WR . Like the typical DSLR design, you have front and rear command dials, giving you quick control over settings, and on the top there are dedicated buttons for Video, White Balance, ISO, and a custom function button. This makes it easy to quickly change common settings without having to go into the Q (Quick) menu. However, there will be those that have used Fujifilm’s other cameras who will prefer analogue dials. There’s also a quaint charm to analogue dials that is clearly missing from the X-H2/X-H2s cameras. This will be down to one’s own personal preference, as to which you prefer. Viewfinder and screen Also on board is the same excellent 5.76m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF) , which provides 0.8x magnification and a 120fps refresh rate . This gives an excellent view of the scene, with plenty of detail right into the corners thanks to excellent optics. There’s a comfortable eyecup, which is especially helpful in sunny conditions, and dioptre adjustment is available. On default settings the camera previews any colour settings live in the viewfinder, as well as your exposure. When you half-press the shutter button, the aperture stops down to its set value, and you can preview depth of field. You can use compositional aids such as the dual-axis electronic level and any gridlines you’ve chosen. You’ll also find a Natural Live View option, which switches off all processing preview, giving you an experience more like using an optical viewfinder. If your preference is video recording, there’s a Log Assist view option, which aids when shooting with a flat log profile, giving a more natural rendering of the scene. You can toggle these on and off using a function button. Beneath the EVF is a 3in, 1.62m-dot vari-angle touchscreen that can positioned to face almost any direction, including directly forwards, making it perfectly suited for video and vlogging (LINK). A status display on top shows current exposure settings, as well as quickly letting you know the remaining shots even when the camera is switched off – useful when you want to be sure whether the camera has a memory card in it or not. Autofocus The Fujifilm X-H2 offers the same number of focus points as the X-H2S, letting you select between 117 focus points (in a 13 x 9 grid), or 425 focus points (in a 25 x 17 array). There are additional area modes available, so that you can simply let the camera focus on subjects across the frame, without having to set this specifically, and the combination of phase detection and contrast detection results in fast and reliable focus. You also benefit from the same subject detection as the X-H2S, with detection of animals, birds, automobiles, motorcycles (and bikes), airplanes, and trains, as well as face and eye detection for humans, animals, and birds. However, once you enable subject recognition for one of these subjects, the camera turns off human face and eye detection (and vice versa). Subject detection works very well the majority of the time, but if the camera doesn’t automatically detect and recognise a subject, then it will switch back to standard AF tracking, and this also performs very well. Fujifilm X-H2: Performance and Image Quality Despite the increase in resolution to 40MP, and the obvious additional demand this puts on the camera in terms of raw data that needs to be processed, the camera still feels rapid and responsive. It’s unlikely
        that you’d notice any slowdown unless you were using the X-H2 and X-H2S side-by-side. The shutter noise is noticeable in how quiet it is. If you’re not right next to the camera, then it really is very difficult to hear, operating with a soft click. If you need complete and utter silence, then of course, the electronic shutter is entirely silent. You can also switch on a pre-recorded sound if you wish to hear when the camera is shooting, for example when shooting continuously. Metering and auto white balance – which now features AI Artificial Intelligence Auto White Balance (AWB), which is on by default, and designed to give better AWB results. This system works through Fujifilm training a system with a series of images (in the thousands) so that when the camera detects a similar scene it is guided as to how to correctly set the white balance. Metering is generally very reliable, however, in certain circumstances this can vary quite noticeably (wildly!), for example when using face detection, the camera will set the exposure based on the detected subjects face, and this can mean your exposure will vary noticeably from shot-to-shot. In-body image stabilisation (IBIS) works well, giving you additional confidence when shooting in low-light conditions, and allows you to keep ISO speeds slower when needed. This works in combination with the lens, if it has optical image stabilisation (OIS), for added stabilisation. Continuous shooting speeds do not match the Fujifilm X-H2S , with 15fps available with the mechanical shutter, and 20fps with the electronic shutter and a crop into the image. For the fastest throughput, using a CFexpress card is recommended, as performance will drop with an SD card. If you do use an SD card, then you can get the best performance from the use of a UHS-II card. There are a number of different options designed to help you capture more dynamic range in your images beyond the most obvious method of shooting raw. This includes DR and HDR options, with DR options including: DR100, 200, 400, and there is a slight but noticeable improvement in dynamic range when using these, albeit with an increase in ISO range as you step up through the options. There’s also an HDR drive mode which uses multi-shot, multi-shot, and these are automatically merged in camera giving you a JPEG and raw image. The options include HDR Auto, 200, 400, 800, and Plus. ‘Plus’ is the extra high dynamic range similar to the HDR you get on most smartphones. In addition, you can also use the HEIC file format to capture more dynamic range in images, although it’s worth noting that very few photo editing packages support this file format. Colour reproduction is extremely pleasing, and to an extent this can be entirely customised to your own personal preferences, either by using the built-in film simulations, or by adjusting the myriad of settings. In fact, so popular and customisable are these settings, that you can even Google “Fujifilm film recipes” and find guidance from others on how to set these up to emulate additional film types or looks. Pixel Shift Multi Shot – shooting 160MP images The high-resolution 160MP mode is accessed via the drive mode dial and is called Pixel Shift Multi Shot. There are options for a short interval, with 1s, 2s, 5s, and 15s. You can delay the start by using the self-timer (recommended), and the camera will shoot these images as raw files, with no option to shoot JPEG(s). This takes 20 shots which you then need to stitch together on the computer. The camera needs to be used on a tripod and will not give you any indication as to whether the shots will merge together correctly or not. To combine the images taken you need to use the Fujifilm Pixel Shift Combiner software (available for PC and Mac): On a relatively high-spec PC (Ryzen 5 3600, 6/12c/t, 16GB), it took roughly 15 seconds to combine for more accurate colour (RGB information at every pixel), and around 25 seconds to combine for high-resolution and more accurate colour. This gives you a high-resolution (160MP) 613MB DNG file, or a 40MP 195MB DNG file, which you can then use in Photoshop or the photo editing software of your choice. The 40MP full-colour results can be quite subtle depending on the subject, and similar results could be possible by processing raw files and turning up the sharpening. This would also be a much quicker and less painful process. In our test shots, we had a 50% success rate. The larger 160MP image also included some rough edges, and we hope that the processing and quality of the results will be improved with future firmware and/or software updates, particularly considering the additional time needed in shooting, storing, and processing the images. ISO and Noise Noise performance is very good, with noise well controlled, and particularly impressive results at the lower ISO speeds where you will be able to see the most detail. As the ISO speed increases noise also increases, and as expected this has a detrimental
        effect on the levels of detail recorded in the image. ISO 12,800 is where it will come down to your own personal needs and preferences as to whether this speed is usable for you. However, we’d recommend avoiding ISO 25,600 as results don’t look particularly good. Similarly, ISO 5,1200 shouldn’t be used as noise is excessive and detail is dramatically reduced. Video recording In-body Image Stabilisation performs fairly well when recording video, however, it doesn’t quite match Micro Four Thirds cameras, and therefore for the most stable footage, it’s likely you’ll need to use a tripod, or gimbal when walking or vlogging , however, your needs may vary, and you may be able to hold a camera steadier, compared to the next person. The IS modes include IBIS/OIS (where the IBIS will work in combination with OIS – if the lens has OIS), IBIS/OIS + Digital IS, and Off. An additional “IS Mode Boost” option is available, designed for ‘static hand-held shooting’. Detail captured in the 8K and 4K video modes is indeed impressive, and you could easily use the 8K footage and take still image captures from this if you so wished, giving you 33MP images. Value for money The Fujifilm X-H2 is available for $1,999 / £1,879 body only, which makes it excellent value for money, considering it’s the highest resolution APS-C camera available, and one of the cheapest mirrorless cameras available that records 8K video. Alternatives include the: And without going to a full-frame camera, you’re unable to match the (single-shot) resolution on offer, and if you do want to, you’re looking at a much more expensive camera, such as the Nikon Z7 II. For 8K video recording, you’ll also need to go to a full-frame camera, and 8K video recording cameras as alternatives, includes the: Although it’s not just numbers that are worth looking at when it comes to choosing a camera, as the range and availability of lenses will also make a huge difference as to how usable a camera is, and whether it will suit your own needs, and as such the Fujifilm X system has an excellent range of X-Mount lenses.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: After a couple of weeks shooting with the Canon EOS R6 Mark II, my overriding impression is of a camera that’ll do pretty much anything you ask of it. It takes the already excellent EOS R6 and makes it even better, with faster shooting and impressive subject detection AF. It’s difficult to appreciate just how useful this type of autofocus system can be for tracking moving subjects, but once you’ve tried it, you may be reluctant to go back to a conventional setup again. Like its predecessor, the Mark II also handles extremely well. It’s not quite as small as its rivals from Nikon, Panasonic or Sony, but this provides space for a large, deep handgrip and extensive external controls. Add to this its excellent image quality, and you have a seriously impressive all-rounder. You’ll have to pay considerably more to get significantly higher performance in any given area, without compromising elsewhere. For current Canon DSLR users, the EOS R6 Mark II represents an extremely tempting option for switching to mirrorless while still being able to use their existing EF lenses. Those using the original EOS R will find it a considerable upgrade, too, despite its slightly lower resolution. There’s rather less incentive for EOS R6 users to update, though, unless they need a specific feature it offers. For brand-agnostic buyers it’s an extremely strong alternative to the likes of the Sony Alpha 7 IV, with the main gripe being the lack of third-party RF lenses. But this is the only real blot on the copy book of a superb camera that’s an excellent update to its illustrious predecessor.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Canon EOS R6 Mark II at a glance: It’s only a little over two years since Canon introduced its original enthusiast-focused EOS R6 , alongside the 45MP EOS R5 . While its high-resolution sibling grabbed all the headlines, the more affordable model set about establishing itself as the realistic choice for most photographers, winning our Product of the Year award in 2021 . Now the firm has given it a major update, with the EOS R6 Mark II gaining a brand-new 24MP sensor in place of the previous 20MP chip. There’s also an array of feature updates, plus a few small but significant design and interface tweaks. At $2,499 / £2,779 body-only , the EOS R6 Mark II comes to market for a moderate premium over its now-discontinued predecessor, which cost £2500 at launch (but can be bought more cheaply while stocks last). This places it up against some strong competitors that cost rather less, perhaps most notably the excellent 33MP Sony Alpha A7 IV ($2498 / £2,399) and the promising-looking Panasonic Lumix S5 II ($2000 / £2000). Canon will no doubt be hoping that its impressive headline specs, including 40fps shooting and a sophisticated subject recognition autofocus system, will be sufficient to keep its existing DSLR users loyal and buy into the R system. But does the EOS R6 Mark II really offer enough justify its price tag? Canon EOS R6 Mark II: Features Firstly, let’s consider the 24.2MP Dual Pixel CMOS AF II sensor. While it has the same resolution as the one in the high-end EOS R3, it doesn’t employ the same stacked architecture for ultra-fast readout. However, Canon claims that it delivers low-light performance to match the EOS R6’s 20MP chip, with a standard sensitivity range that runs all the way from ISO 100 up to ISO 102,400 and is extendable to ISO 204,800. On the subject of autofocus, the EOS R6 Mark II builds on the subject detection AF system previously seen in the EOS R3, with the camera now capable of recognising aircraft, trains and horses (including, rather wonderfully, zebras), as well as humans, cars, animals and birds . AF tracking is available in all focus modes, and Canon says autofocus continues to function in light levels as low as -6.5EV . The buffer is impressively deep too, at 190 JPEG or 140 CRAW files in a single burst. On this note, Canon’s CRAW format produces unusually small raw files without any apparent loss of quality, which means you can fit more onto a card. It’s a seemingly minor feature but has a real practical benefit. Another boon for low-light shooting is the camera’s in-body image stabilisation , which is now rated for up to 8 stops shake correction. Many of Canon’s RF lenses are optically stabilised, too, with the in-lens and in-body systems working together to deliver the best possible effect. In principle the system also works with adapted manual-focus lenses, such as Canon’s old FD-mount optics. But as with the original EOS R6, the process of entering the lens’s focal length to make the system work properly is unnecessarily long-winded and clunky. Interesting new video features include focus breathing compensation to correct for any change in the angle of view when pulling focus between different distances, and ‘face only AF’ where the camera won’t attempt to refocus when a human subject walks out of shot. There’s even a movie pre-recording option, where either 3 or 5 seconds of footage can be continuously buffered before you start filming, so you don’t miss a key moment of action. Updated connectivity includes Bluetooth 5 and 5GHz Wi-Fi , which can be used to connect the camera wirelessly to either a smartphone, tablet or computer. Canon’s free Camera Remote app for Android and iOS offers all the usual features, including the ability to operate the camera remotely over Wi-Fi, with a live view feed and extensive control over settings. You can also copy photos across to your phone for sharing, even when the camera is powered off and packed away in your bag. Other useful options that you don’t always get elsewhere include a quick and easy Bluetooth remote control , and the ability to update the camera’s firmware via your phone. It’s possible to connect the camera to a mobile device via its USB-C port for a more stable connection and use Camera Remote that way, which in effect allows a phone or tablet to be used as an external monitor. It’s a mystery why more cameras don’t allow this. Like most other recent models, the EOS R6 Mark II can be used as a 4K webcam for video calls, without any need to install additional software on your computer. Canon EOS R6 Mark II: Key features Canon has taken the excellent EOS R6 and added a number of welcome improvements. Canon EOS R6 Mark II: Build and handling Externally, the EOS R6 Mark III is very much like its predecessor. This is a good thing, as the R6 handled exceptionally well. In terms of build, you get the same magnesium alloy chassis and glass fibre-reinforced polycarbonate shell. This may not have quite the same bullet-proof
        feel as Canon EOS 5D-series DSLRs used to, but it makes the camera considerably lighter. Thanks to the tall, deep grip , the camera gives a secure hold and feels well balanced in your hand, even with relatively large lenses such as the Canon RF 100-500mm f/4.5-7.1L IS USM . As we’d expect, the body is weather-sealed . The control layout is derived from Canon’s EOS DSLRs, but with various significant updates. Along with the familiar front and rear control dials for changing exposure settings, there’s an additional thumb dial on the top plate dedicated to ISO. Uniquely to Canon – and extremely usefully – this can be used to shift the ISO setting temporarily in Auto ISO mode. There’s also a conventional exposure mode dial (complete with three custom positions), and an AF multi-controller joystick , which at long last is enabled by default. Canon’s higher-end RF lenses also all have separate lens control dials that can be configured to change exposure settings. However on the cheaper RF lenses, this function is provided by the manual focus ring, which doesn’t work as well. Compared to the original EOS R6, there are a couple of updates. Most notably, what was previously the on/off switch on the top left is now a stills/video mode selector . This has the advantage of giving easy access to all the exposure modes for video recording, including the C positions. It also brings up a video-optimised interface with a 16:9 preview and separately saved settings. However, I found this switch was a bit too easy to knock accidentally when removing the camera from my bag, and wish it were either firmer or had an interlock button. The power switch has moved onto the right side of the top plate, where it’s easier to reach, although still not quite as convenient as one around the shutter button like on most other brands. It now has a central lock position similar to many older Canon DSLRs, replacing the R6’s separate lock button. This can be used to disable any combination of the camera’s control dials, joystick, and touchscreen, or the lens control ring. Personally, I don’t really understand why you’d have a setting whose sole function is to stop the camera from working properly – other manufacturers don’t feel the need to inflict this on us – but thankfully you can disable it altogether. Canon has updated its useful Dial Function option, so that pressing the tiny M-Fn button beside the shutter release now allows you to change pairs of settings at a time using the front and rear dials. Meanwhile, rotating the top dial chooses between the available pairs of functions. By default, this gives quick access to white balance and metering; drive and focus modes; flash exposure compensation and ISO; and picture style and AF area. You can reconfigure this to suit your preferences, but the only other option you can add is exposure compensation. It’s a real shame you can’t use it to scroll through the subject detection modes. Other key settings can be changed using the onscreen quick menu , activated by pressing the Q button on the back. This button sits in the middle of a dense cluster of ten controls, all of which are operated by your right thumb. In practice, this isn’t as bad as it might sound, as you’re unlikely to be using many of them at any given time. However, I found it almost impossible to distinguish the trio of Magnify, Q and Info buttons with the camera up to your eye. Most of the controls can be customised, but I saw little need to do so, as all the buttons do useful things, and the default control layout works very well. One option, though, is to re-purpose the video record button to another function for stills shooting. Or depending on how you shoot, you may prefer to customise the depth of field preview button on the front. As usual, Canon provides a touchscreen interface that covers every aspect of the camera’s operation, complementing rather than replacing physical controls. Canon’s menus are clearly labelled and relatively logically laid out, and there’s a user-configurable My Menu where you can group your most-used settings. This is handy, as certain useful options, such as the mechanical/electronic shutter selection and raw burst mode, are otherwise only selectable from the main menu. Aside from this, the EOS R6 Mark II offers one of the finest shooting experiences of any camera around. Canon EOS R6 Mark II: Viewfinder and screen When it comes to composing and viewing your images, Canon has used the same 3.69m-dot EVF and 3in, 1.62m-dot fully articulated touchscreen as on the original R6. With 0.76x magnification and a 120fps refresh rate, the viewfinder is very good indeed, although it can be a little difficult to see in very bright light. Move your eye away from the viewfinder and the camera will automatically switch to the LCD below. Again, this gives an accurate preview, while its side-hinged, fully articulated design aids shooting from a tripod, or at unusual angles in either portrait or landscape formats.
        It can also be set facing forwards for selfies or vlogging. Compared to the original R6, there are a couple of small but useful updates. Firstly, the EOS R6 Mark II gains the OVF View Assist mode that debuted on the EOS R3, which brightens shadows and reproduces colours neutrally to give a more SLR-like viewing experience. This can be particularly useful in high contrast conditions, or when you need to apply negative exposure compensation to retain highlight detail. You can assign this to a function button to toggle easily between the two viewing modes; I used the video record button. By default, depth-of-field preview is provided via a button on the cameras front, much like a traditional DSLR. However, Canon has added a menu setting to enable full-time DOF preview , with the lens always stopped down to the selected aperture. I’d be tempted to use this mode in daylight, but when light levels fall, it can reduce the viewfinder’s refresh rate excessively, giving a disconcertingly choppy view. Another useful update comes in video mode. When the camera is recording, a flashing red outline appears around the display, both in the viewfinder and on the LCD. This partially makes up for the fact that there’s no tally light on the camera’s front to indicate that it’s recording. Canon EOS R6 Mark II: Autofocus Like Canon’s other cameras, autofocus is provided by the firm’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology, which allows every sensor pixel to be used for phase detection autofocus. There are 4897 user-selectable points arranged across practically the entire frame, and you can choose between multiple sizes of focus area. This includes three custom options that allow you to specify the height and width of the focus zone, which is especially handy if you know your subjects will appear in a particular region of the image, for example cars on a racetrack. It’s particularly easy to cycle through area modes, by pressing the AF Area button followed by M-Fn. As we’d expect, for single-shot AF on static subjects, the EOS R6 Mark II is essentially flawless, focusing quickly, silently and reliably. Its conventional tracking mode also works well, and is especially easy to activate just by pressing the SET button on the back. Sony could learn a thing or two from Canon in this regard. However, the latest AF systems are all about AI-based subject recognition and tracking, particularly with continuous AF. On the EOS R6 Mark II, Canon has deployed what is, on paper, its most advanced system to date , going beyond even the flagship EOS R3 . So while the R6 offered eye detection and tracking for humans and animals, the Mark II gains the ability to recognise a wider range of animals, along with vehicles such as cars, trains and planes . There’s even a spot recognition setting, in which the camera will home in on the most important part of the subject – for example the front windscreen of a vehicle. What you don’t get, though, is the EOS R3’s brilliant eye control focus, or the readout speed of its stacked sensor (which generally translates to better AF tracking accuracy). You can pre-select the subject type you’re expecting to shoot via the Q Menu, with the available options of humans, animals, and vehicles being refreshingly straightforward compared to the over-complicated setup menus used by some other brands (we’re looking at you again, Sony). But you can also leave the camera to detect automatically what it’s looking at, which is useful in situations when you might be switching rapidly between different kinds of subjects. It’s also possible to set a function button to cycle through the various options (again, using the movie record button could be an option here). In my experience, the subject detection system works extraordinarily well , allowing you concentrate on composition and timing while the camera follows the subject and keeps it sharp. With large, predictably moving subjects such as vehicles, it’ll get things right pretty much all the time. However, when shooting small, erratic subjects such as birds with high-speed bursts, I found that it occasionally lost track, drifting onto foreground or background detail instead. It’s possible that spending a bit of time tweaking and fine-tuning the AF system would give more reliable results. Auto subject selection isn’t foolproof, either. For example, when I was photographing birds perched in trees, it decided more than once to outline and concentrate on branches instead (it’s not obvious what kind of subject the camera thought it was focusing on). But despite these occasional flaws, the autofocus is still far beyond that offered by any DSLR, making it easier than ever to get sharp images of moving subjects. However, the EOS R6 Mark II is, understandably, not quite a mini EOS R3. Canon EOS R6 Mark II: Performance As befits a camera aimed at serious enthusiasts, the EOS R6 Mark II is extremely quick and responsive . It’s worth knowing, though, that having Bluetooth enabled can slow down
        its otherwise instantaneous start-up. It’s important to update to the latest firmware and, if you continue to have problems, consider disabling Bluetooth. Operationally, the camera is very quiet and discreet, with the shutter firing with just a quiet snick. Switch to electronic shutter mode and it’s completely silent, but this does come with a risk of rolling shutter distortion. Metering, auto white balance and colour are all very typically Canon – in other words, predictably reliable. The standard evaluative metering mode is closely linked to the focus point , which means that if you focus on a dark area of the scene, you’ll risk clipping highlight detail irrecoverably. But this is easy to see in the viewfinder, so you can apply the requisite exposure compensation when necessary (note though that it’s not visible in OVF View Assist mode). Auto white balance is generally well judged, meaning that out-of-camera JPEGs are usually good for sharing directly from the camera, with just a little tweaking. You will, however, get best results shooting raw, especially when you want to make significant tonal adjustments after shooting. In this regard, the EOS R6 Mark II’s 24MP sensor offers a good degree of dynamic range, allowing you to pull up shadow detail by at least three stops without any problem. Go much further, though, and you’ll run into visible artefacts, where Canon appears to be applying noise reduction to the darkest tones in the raw file. This means that you don’t get quite the malleability of the very best full-frame sensors, but it’s still plenty enough for most real-world situations. Continuous shooting performance is impressive, but as usual, the devil is in the detail. Using the mechanical shutter at its highest 12fps frame rate, you don’t get live view between frames (just a quick review of your recorded images), which makes it difficult to track moving subjects. If you want live view between frames, you’re reduced to shooting at 7fps , although with a vast 230-shot buffer. The camera’s headline 40fps top speed requires switching to the electronic shutte r, which means a trip into the menus – annoyingly you can’t just access it as a drive mode setting. As the sensor isn’t stacked, there’s an appreciable rolling shutter effect. While this isn’t bad enough to make your subject obviously distorted, it can make vertical lines in the background appear slanted when you’re panning, which could be problematic with subjects such as motorsport. There are also 20fps and 5fps electronic shutter modes, but while the two faster options display a flickering outline around the image to indicate when the camera is shooting, at 5fps the entire display flashes on and off – an effect that I found disconcerting to the point of being unusable. Raw burst mode is also accessed via the menu. Here the camera shoots at 30fps, with up to 15 frames buffered before you fully depress the shutter button. Bursts are captured as a single file, from which you can then extract individual frames in playback, as either raw or JPEG files. It works, but it’s very clunky compared to OM System’s Pro Capture mode. The in-body image stabilisation is, as it was on the EOS R6, very effective. Using the Canon RF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM towards its wide and, I found I could get consistently sharp shots at shutter speeds close to a second , and I even got the occasional usable frame at longer speeds. This can be really useful for shooting hand-held in low light, or for experimenting with long shutter speeds for creative effect. However, it’s no help with moving subjects. Current Canon DSLR users will find that the EOS R6 Mark II works seamlessly with their existing EF-mount lenses via the EF-EOS R mount adapter (or indeed cheaper clones from the likes of Viltrox). I tested it with my EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM and EF 100mm f/2 USM with good results. Both image stabilisation and autofocus continue to operate perfectly; indeed with fast primes, chances are it’ll deliver a rather higher percentage of properly focused shots. This means you can use your exisitng EF mount lenses and you don’t have to buy a whole new set of RF lenses straight away. Canon’s full-frame RF lens line-up now covers most bases, with a good range of affordable options alongside premium L-series lenses including some unique and clever designs. But on the other hand, Canon is the only company that’s still blocking third-party lens makers from using its full-frame mirrorless mount. This means there’s a vastly better choice of native lenses available for Sony E-mount in particular. Canon EOS R6 Mark II: ISO and noise With its 24MP sensor, the EOS R6 gains a 10% increase in linear resolution over its predecessor. While this isn’t in any way unwelcome, it’s not a massive upgrade. The sensor delivers very clean images at low ISOs, and extremely usable results a moderately high settings, too: I’d have absolutely no hesitation in using ISO 3200 . Beyond this, noise starts to have a
        more obvious impact on fine detail and colour, and each photographer will have their own cut-off point where it becomes unacceptable. Personally, I was happy with the images I shot at ISO 25,600 and would consider ISO 51,200 usable at a pinch. But I’d steer clear of the higher settings.

      value: 'Striking a strong balance between aesthetics and performance, the Sony Alpha 6000 is a desirable camera with no standout flaws. Of course, improvements can – and will – always be made, but Sony largely hit the nail on the head with the NEX-6 and NEX-7 cameras, so rather than drastically overhauling those designs for their replacement, it has simply advanced the imaging technology and processing power of this updated model. The improvements, particularly in low-light performance and speed, are significant enough to justify an existing NEX user upgrading, and I also believe the Alpha 6000 will challenge the entry-level DSLR market and appeal to advanced enthusiasts, just as Sony is hoping it will. Top-spec technology and a host of cutting-edge features may just see the Alpha 6000 mirror the longevity and success of its predecessor and keep it competitive in years to come. Is the Sony A6000 still worth buying in 2023? Though it is pushing on 10 years old, the Sony A6000 remains an excellent camera, particularly for those looking for a budget camera they can learn and grow with. It may lack the 4K video and AF capabilities of some of Sony’s more modern cameras, but it still delivers beautiful images. It has been discontinued but there are plenty of options in the used market with excellent condition models at around $350-400 / £350-400. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Key features'
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Sony Alpha 6000 at a glance: Sony Alpha 6000 review – Introduction When Sony launched the A6000 back in 2014, it marked a turning point for the company as it shifted focus away from its popular NEX range of – as they were then called – compact system cameras and began seriously developing its Alpha series cameras. The Sony A6000 is an entry-level APS-C format mirrorless camera which can still be purchased today. It has been superseded several times by the Sony A6100, Sony A6300, Sony A6400 , Sony A6500 and Sony A6600 , showing just how popular this model has been. And while its siblings offer better AF performance and 4K video, but nevertheless the Sony A6000 remains one of the best cameras for beginners . The Sony A6000 marked the marriage of the portable NEX cameras into the Alpha family. The Sony Alpha 6000 was an update to the NEX-6 which, at the time was one of the most popular compact system cameras on the market. The Sony A6000 retained the distinctive NEX body shape, but that is pretty much where the similarities end. Inside the E-mount-compatible Alpha 6000, Sony included some of its best technology at the time. With the Sony A6000, the company was trying to blur the lines between the DSLR and compact system camera markets. To help the Sony Alpha 6000 compete with DSLRs, Sony included its  Bionz X processor, which featured in the then-flagship Sony Alpha 7R, plus an improved version of the APS-C-sized, 24.3-million-pixel Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor that featured in its previous SLT flagship, the Alpha 77. In short, the Sony Alpha 6000 represented a change in direction for Sony and helped kick-start its drive to become the leader in the mirrorless market. Sony Alpha A6000 firmware updates Sony has updated the Alpha 6000 numerous times in the years since its launch. Its most recent firmware update, version 3.21, came in 2019 and provided improved stability of the camera’s AF operation. Previous updates in 2016 optimised the camera’s performance with the latest Sony lenses, while firmware updates in 2015 and 2014 shortened the start-up time, enabled shooting movies in 60p/30p/24p in the XAVC S format and added support for Sony’s Smart Remote Control app. You can download all of the Sony A6000 firmware updates from Sony’s website . Sony Alpha 6000 review: Features The 24.3-million-pixel, APS-C-sized image sensor in the Sony Alpha 6000 features a gapless on-chip design, increasing the camera’s light-collecting efficiency for improved low-light shooting and reduced noise throughout its ISO 100-25,600 sensitivity range. It is also worth noting that there is no anti-aliasing filter in this model. In the past few years, the high-end interchangeable-lens camera landscape has become increasingly competitive, with Olympus’s OM-D range, Fujifilm’s X-series and Panasonic’s GX and GH cameras all continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in a mirrorless camera. However, the Sony Alpha 6000 enters the market with one of the most impressive feature lists in its class, greatly benefiting from the improved processing power of the Bionz X engine, which is three times as fast as the original Bionz processor used in the NEX cameras. The increased speed is particularly notable in terms of start-up time. From switching the camera on, I can begin shooting in about a second, even in hi-speed burst mode, which is fantastic for sharp shooters wanting to capture shots at a moment’s notice. Improvements to areas such as autofocus speed have been enabled by this extra power, with the Alpha 6000 recording a rapid focusing time of 0.06sec according to the CIPA standard. Under ideal conditions, the Alpha 6000 has one of the fastest focusing systems on the market, even faster than that of the impressive Fujifilm X-T1. It also helps that the shutter lag is imperceptible, with the Alpha 6000 achieving focus almost instantaneously. Burst-mode shooting at up to 11fps, continuous for 21 raw + JPEG frames or 49 fine JPEGs, is also possible before buffering becomes an issue. This will appeal to anyone considering using the camera for sports, action or fast-moving family members. The Sony Alpha 6000 has 25 precision contrast-detection AF points, as did the NEX-6. But there’s a more significant improvement to the number of phase-detection points, up from 99 previously to 179 points, covering almost 100% of the frame. The new hybrid autofocus system not only makes it easier for the camera to recognise scenes, but it also boosts the ability of the Alpha 6000 to lock onto the correct subjects and track them tenaciously. AF-A (a combination of continuous and single-shot AF) is featured in the Alpha 6000, which is a first for the Sony E-mount family. When in this mode, and faced with situations where subjects aren’t predominantly stationary or moving, the camera will select the appropriate focusing mode for the scene. I’m also pleased to see that Sony has enabled active AF point visibility, making it easier to check whether focusing
        is accurate or not, particularly while shooting burst frames and tracking. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Sony PlayMemories apps The Alpha 6000 comes with some fantastic features straight out of the box, including Sony’s recently updated PlayMemories app library, which is accessible through the camera’s menu when connected to Wi-Fi. This provides you with a host of additional features that you can download (for free or purchase) to expand the camera’s functionality. A couple of the applications I really liked were Liveview Grading and Light Shaft. Liveview Grading enables you to add colour effects to your videos in real-time, adjusting various aspects such as colour-depth saturation or applying preset effects. Costing £7.99, it’s a downsized version of what video editors spend hours doing on programs that cost 20 times as much. Light Shaft does pretty much what you’d expect, and for £3.99 you can use it to craft the light in your images using one of four light shapes: flare, ray of light, star and light beam. It’s a really interesting effect that can add atmosphere and drama to an otherwise flat image. Light intensity, width, direction and position are all adjustable, and the app makes a copy of your image so that the original is untouched. I also enjoyed using Cinematic Photo, Smart Remote Control and Catch Light. I did experience some stability issues with certain apps, but the camera’s firmware has since been updated so hopefully these will have been addressed, and for the most part I found them straightforward to use. Sony PlayMemories apps are a fun and affordable way to expand the Alpha 6000’s capabilities and create effects in-camera, saving you time in front of a computer. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Build and handling Designed to operate like a DSLR, the Alpha 6000 has dual shutter and aperture control via a shoulder dial behind the shutter and the selection wheel on the rear of the camera. The ergonomically moulded, rubberised grip provides a firm hold, and Sony has smartly placed the dedicated movie record button just on the outer side of where your thumb naturally rests, making it easy to access while avoiding accidental pressing. The first of the two custom buttons, C1, sits beside the shutter button, while C2 can be used to delete images during playback mode, as well as be set to access a number of functions and quick menus. The Fn button above the rear control wheel opens the shortcut menu and can also be used to connect to a smart device for image transfer. Auto-exposure lock (AEL), main menu and manual flash buttons sit along the top of the LCD screen, although given the numerous ways in which the Alpha 6000 can be customised, there’s little reason to delve into the main menu once you’ve got the camera set up how you like. I found the Alpha 6000’s controls easy to access and operate during use. Within a short time of using the camera, I could adapt controls swiftly without even looking at the LCD or averting my attention away from compositions. In terms of portability, most of the camera’s weight sits in the grip, which houses the battery and memory card, but this is countered by the weight of the lens, making the Alpha 6000 well balanced. It’s comfortable to operate one-handed, but for optimum comfort I preferred to use two hands and shoot through the EVF in the majority of instances. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Metering The 1,200-zone evaluative multi-segment metering does a superb job of rendering true-to-life levels of exposure in most instances. The Alpha 6000’s ability to take a reading from a large portion of the frame makes for reliable meter readings that produce consistent results. Shooting a foreground subject with bright sunlight behind is one of the most challenging scenarios a metering system can face, but when left to its own devices the Alpha 6000 still captured pleasing results, only naturally losing highlight detail in the out-of-focus background. Taking advantage of the camera’s spot and centreweighted metering does help, though, and the camera’s extensive ±5EV exposure compensation in 1⁄3 steps gives great additional control over exposures. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Dynamic range Shadow areas in high-contrast scenes retain a good amount of detail, particularly the raw files, but I found compressed JPEGs also contained recoverable shadow and highlight detail. In our dynamic range tests, the Alpha 6000 scored 12.26EV at ISO 100, which is on a par with Canon’s EOS 1200D and keeping up with the recently released DSLR throughout its sensitivity range. In most conditions, I found colours from the Alpha 6000 to be rich and vibrant, and the reproduction of highlight and shadow detail is instantly pleasing, without the need to apply curves or adjustments in post-production. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Autofocus The response time of the Alpha 6000’s 179-point hybrid AF system is exceedingly fast, with no discernible shutter lag. When the shutter button is half-pressed to lock onto a subject or scene,
        focus is attained almost instantly, even in relatively low ambient light. The combination of improved phase and precision contrast detection, powered by the new Bionz X processor, gives the camera the ability to create a 3D map of the subject so that it can read the distance of each element in the focus area. Benefits from the improved system also carry over into AF performance, as the Alpha 6000 can drive its lenses 35% faster than Sony’s previous system. In use, the Alpha 6000 switches focus points rapidly when tracking subjects using its 11fps hi-speed continuous burst mode, demonstrated by small red AF points lighting up in the display as your subjects move across, towards or away in the frame. It’s the closest thing many users will get to shooting fast-moving subjects with a Nikon D4S or a Canon EOS-1D X, for a fraction of the price. I did experience dropped focus in a few frames, but I was able to capture so many frames either side of the failures that it wasn’t a significant issue. Overall, I was very impressed with the Alpha 6000’s AF performance: it’s one of the fastest cameras in its class and snappier than any comparable DSLR. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Noise, resolution and sensitivity Considering the resolution of the Alpha 6000’s 24.3-million-pixel, APS-C-sized sensor, we expected the Alpha 6000 to perform well – and it did. It scored 32 on our resolution chart, which is comparable to the 31 scored by the Nikon D5300. Multi-frame noise reduction (MFNR) is now included in ISO settings in-camera rather than via a downloadable app, as was the case with the NEX-5R and NEX-6. This is deployed in low-light situations, firing off six frames in quick succession and then stacking them into a single image to combat noise. At lower ISO levels, there’s no distinct advantage to using MFNR, but at higher sensitivity settings the improvement in noise reduction and detail retention is impressive, particularly beyond ISO 1600. There’s almost no visible colour noise in any images until about ISO 6400, and looking at the raw files it’s possible to balance the noise reduction enough to remove any damaging noise while still retaining a good level of edge sharpness and texture. The camera is capable of applying area-specific noise reduction that is intelligent enough to avoid being too aggressive, until you push it to its extremes. Beyond ISO 8000, photographs begin to look more artistic than accurate when viewed any larger than they automatically appear on the Alpha 6000’s 3in screen. I’d happily print JPEG images straight out of the Alpha 6000, but for scenarios where light is very limited and you need a fast-enough shutter speed to shoot handheld, the Alpha 6000’s capable sensitivity performance is a great support. Sony Alpha 6000 review: White balance and colour I was happy with the white balance and colours captured by the Alpha 6000. Regardless of which colours dominated the frame, the camera was able to intelligently read and apply the appropriate settings. However, there are 11 white balance presets as well as the option to assign one custom option if you want more precise settings, plus 12 creative style modes to add some in-camera colour options. The only one I wasn’t particularly impressed with was portrait mode, as its default effect made people look either unwell or hot. That said, the best thing about the colour styles is the ability to adjust their contrast, saturation and sharpness to achieve a look that suits your tastes. I prefer to make colour adjustments myself in post-processing and leave the camera in its default mode. Standard colour captured by the Alpha 6000 is rich, and saturated enough to be vibrant without being unrealistic. Sony Alpha 6000 review: Viewfinder, LCD and video On paper, the Alpha 6000’s Tru-Finder-branded, 0.39in, 1.44-million-dot OLED EVF appears to be a downgrade from the 0.5in, 2.3-million-dot XGA OLED viewfinder that featured on the NEX-6. Even the magnification has been slightly reduced, from 1.09x in the NEX-6 to 1.07x, equivalent to 70x in 35mm terms. However, in use, the smaller, lower-resolution EVF on the Alpha 6000 appears to render a 100% field of view with greater vibrancy and clarity than its predecessor. The refresh rate is impressive, meaning that lag is barely noticeable when moving the camera, so while it may not be as good as an optical viewfinder, it’s certainly not poor. At 921,600 dots, the Alpha 6000’s 3in TFT LCD screen is a match for the NEX-6 that it replaces, but it’s not quite as impressive as the LCD on the pricier Fujifilm X-T1, or even the cheaper touchscreen-operable Olympus OM-D E-M10, both of which sport 1.04-million-dot screens. The 16:9 aspect ration of the Alpha 6000’s tilting LCD screen works great for video, but leaves two black bars either side when in photo mode, cropping the screen. It didn’t bother me too much because I prefer to shoot stills using the EVF, but it does make the screen appear quite small when using it during live
        view. People keen to shoot video will be pleased to learn that the Alpha 6000 includes some useful functions, including zebra patterning, and that it can record 1920×1080-pixel full HD, AVCHD Ver2.0/MP4 video at 60p and 24p. It also has a Type D Micro HDMI connection, providing a clean HDMI output for video recording. It’s a little disappointing that there’s no headphone jack to monitor audio, but the multi-interface hotshoe at least allows you to connect an external microphone. Sony Alpha 6000 review: The competition With the Alpha 6000, Sony is aiming to attract those considering buying their first DSLR or looking for a highly capable portable second body. While there are many cameras that will be suitable for both audiences, the Olympus OM-D E-M10 and Nikon D5300 stand out as direct competitors. The E-M10 is a superb companion camera, coat-pocket-sized with a lens attached, and suited to a wide range of applications thanks to its micro four thirds mount and good low-light performance. While it lacks some of the video functionality of the Alpha 6000, it has a superior 1,037,000-dot touchscreen and classic DSLR styling. The D5300 is a solid first camera that matches the video and sensor resolution of the Alpha 6000 and has a similar price tag, but benefits from having access to Nikon’s extensive lens family. There is an increase in size and weight with the Nikon, but if that is not a concern it will be tough to choose between the two. Hands-on review Replacing the NEX-6 and NEX-7, the A6000 borrows some of the best technology from Sony’s latest models and squeezes them into a compact body, which will no doubt attract a lot of attention from discerning enthusiasts and prosumers looking for a highly portable solution that packs a premium punch. Physically there are very few differences between the A6000 and the NEX-7, which will be a good thing for many people who have become loyal followers of the NEX brand. It’s a popular form factor amongst the mirrorless camera class and it instantly looks like a high-end piece of kit. Despite sharing many similarities with its predecessors, the A6000 is unmistakably modern and will likely peak the interests of many enthusiasts and pros following its announcement at this year’s CP+ expo in Yokohama, Japan. Key Features The 24.3-million-pixel APS-C Exmor APS HD CMOS gapless design sensor that featured in the Sony SLT-A77 and the Alpha a7 is utilised in the A6000. However, operation and focusing are noticeably snappier following the development of a new focusing algorithm and the Bionz-X processor, three times more powerful than the original processor used in the Sony SLT-A99. Engineers from Sony also revealed to AP that they have begun using a new undisclosed material in their colour filter array, which they say has increased the signal response by 20%, the accuracy of the A6000’s colour reproduction appears to be improved as a result. Sony has managed to record a 0.06 seconds autofocus speed by the CIPA standard, which is faster than the much-celebrated Fujifilm X-100S. In the limited time I had with the pre-production model, AF did appear to work well, with the selection of the correct subjects being seemingly instantaneous. I do look forward to seeing how well focusing performs in lowlight, but the inclusion of a built-in flash with AF-beam assist, and a multifunction hotshoe will provide additional lighting options. The A6000 is also capable of shooting 11fps of RAW+JPEG for 21 frames or 49fps of fine JPEG before it begins buffering, I was still able to continue shooting but at a much slower 1-2fps. Fast burst shooting and performance of the A6000 will certainly appeal anyone planning on shooting action sports. During the hands-on preview we were shown various image and video comparisons between the Sony A6000 and some comparable mid-level CSCs and DSLRs, the results were impressive. Looking at 100% crops of a garden scene containing a mix of stone and plant detail, the A6000, utilizing diffraction reduction technology, managed to resolve sharper edge detail and reduced haloing compared to the 24.2-million-pixel Nikon D5300, particularly at f/11. Colour and contrast also appeared slightly more accurate on the images printed from the camera. Viewfinder and Display In contrary to the fears of rumour site readers, the A6000 does indeed have an EVF, positioned to the left on the back of the camera. The 1.44-million dot resolution OLED “Tru-finder” EVF provides 100% frame coverage, and it works very well in practise, although it’s not quite as clear as an OVF, the additional shooting information displayed on it is very clear indeed, reducing the need to take the camera away from your face whilst shooting. The EVF protrudes slightly from the back of the camera, and the buffering around it is rubberised for extra comfort. The A6000 also has a 3.0-type 921K-dot tiltable LCD, which is bright enough to be used in daylight, and even fairs well in direct sunlight thanks to
        anti-reflective coating. Other Features Collaborating with their camcorder division, Sony appear to have delivered HD video recording performance as good as I’ve seen on any camera in this class, thanks to the inclusion of a highly effective SteadyShot feature and continuous hybrid autofocus during movie mode, combining contrast and phase detection AF capable of recognising and focusing on subjects in motion. The 179-point hybrid AF can cover 90% of the field of view and also uses defocus mapping to calculate the distance of each element in the frame. Capable of ISO sensitivity from 100 to 25,600 (multi-shot mode only), the images I saw show promising lowlight potential well beyond ISO 800. The camera’s area specific noise reduction appears to work well to preserve highlight detail, demonstrated best in a night video scene of a waterfront. Whilst the buildings were clear in the other camera’s examples, their NR had all but completely lost the ripples of light on the water, these were clear in the A6000 example. However, on darker surface the NR smoothes the details a little too heavily as very little luminance noise is visible. The resulting effect is slightly unrealistic dark surfaces that lack in texture. Build and Handling Judging the A6000 by its size, you could make the mistake of not taking it seriously, at only 120 x 66.9 x 45.1mm, it’s only slightly larger than the pocket-sized but highly capable Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ60, but it’s a different class of camera entirely. Dual dial and wheel control, plus six customisable buttons make it possible to tailor your shooting experience to your needs, this will appeal particularly to the advanced enthusiast photographer. When you pick it up, the 285g A6000 is a good weight for its size with the 16-50mm kit lens mounted. Made from a mix of brushed metal and polycarbonate tough plastic, it’s a camera that has been made for photographer with a discerning appreciation for modern design and quality build. Sony have also redesigned and simplified their menus to be uniform across all of their current cameras, the new look is very straightforward and makes the system user friendly and slick. Initial Thoughts The Bionz-X processor is helping Sony’s latest range of cameras squeeze some excellent performance from technologies that have already proven solid and popular in its NEX range. As a result the familiar feeling Sony A6000 feels like a souped-up NEX-6 with improved handling. But with the addition of extra processing power and impressive video features, many people will find themselves considering this new camera, even previous NEX owners will now have a good reason to consider upgrading.'

      value: 'That’s before we even consider Sony’s latest subject recognition AF system, which adds a whole new string to the camera’s bow. It just works so well, which makes shooting those specific subject types so much easier, particularly when they’re moving rapidly or erratically. Of course, if you’re currently using the A7R IV for landscape, portrait, or studio work in mostly static scenarios, then the new AF system probably won’t bring much advantage. On the other hand, it’ll be exciting to see what it delivers on the action-specialist Alpha 1’s eventual successor. Sony Alpha A7R V: Full specification'
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Sony Alpha A7R V at a glance: In late 2022, almost a decade after the debut of the original mirrorless Alpha 7R , the wraps came off the Sony Alpha A7R V, or just the A7R V as it’s most commonly known. As the name implies, it is the fifth in the series, and still the newest. And, just like every ‘R’ series camera, it’s a camera for those who want maximum resolution and image detail . The A7R cameras have always been about sky-high megapixel counts on their full-frame sensors. The blockbuster Sony A7R IV , released in 2019, was the highest-resolution full-frame camera ever made with a whopping 61MP, and to this day it has not yet been surpassed (though the Sigma fp L has equalled it). The A7R V arrived with the same sensor. So if Sony didn’t update the sensor, what exactly was new about the A7R V? The answer, really, was just about everything else. Probably the most significant update was the addition of 2022’s must-have feature for new cameras – subject-detection autofocus . Powered by a brand-new AI processing unit, this system is capable of recognising and locking onto more specific subjects than ever before, including humans, animals, vehicles and more. This makes the A7R V into a much more versatile beast than any of the previous cameras in the R line-up, capable of holding its own with challenging, fast-moving subjects. The physical interface of the camera got an overhaul too, with Sony taking plenty of cues from some of its previous success stories. A welcome addition to the A7R V was a large, highly detailed electronic viewfinder , one we had previously seen on the Alpha 7S III and Alpha 1 . With 9.44m dots of resolution and 0.9x magnification, this gorgeous unit is one of the most compelling arguments ever made for electronic viewfinders. The LCD screen wasn’t forgotten, receiving a new design with an up/down tilting mechanism and a fully articulating side hinge , making it much more versatile for shooting at different angles. The in-body image stabilisation received a bump, and is now rated for up to 8 stops of effective compensation in CIPA testing. It’s a frankly intimidating spec list, and you could forgiven for wondering exactly what the catch is. We kid, of course. You know what the catch is. With a body-only price of $3,898 / £3,999 , the A7R V is significantly more expensive than its predecessor. It costs a lot more than the 45.7MP Nikon Z 7II , and £300 less than the 45MP Canon EOS R5 , slotting firmly into the premium end of the camera market. Does the Sony A7R V make sense as a camera to buy in 2023? Or has Sony created and overloaded, over-priced camera that simply tries to do too much? Find out as we dive into our full Sony A7R V review. For more options, take a look at our guide to the best Sony cameras and the best Sony E-mount lenses . Sony A7R V: Firmware Since the mirrorless camera’s original release, Sony has put out one major firmware update for the A7R V, which arrived at the tail end of March 2023. The most enthusiastically touted feature of the update was the addition of support for the Creators’ app, Sony’s updated version of its old Imaging Edge Mobile app, used to facilitate wireless transfer of images between the camera and a smartphone. It also enables remote settings control and shutter triggering. Probably of more interest to most photographers though was the update to Face Detection autofocus, allowing the user to select particular faces for the camera to prioritise tracking. Of particular use to wedding photographers and photojournalists, this feature means you can input the faces of priority individuals in advance, and rely on the camera to pick them out of a crowd. You can download the latest firmware for the A7R V here . Sony A7R V: Features On the A7R V, Sony has included one of its most sophisticated iterations of subject-detection autofocus, adding cars, trains, airplanes, and insects to the existing list of humans, animals, and birds . It also claims that the camera can understand these subjects in much more detail than before. For example, it can recognise animal heads and bodies as well as eyes, and boasts human ‘pose estimation’, which is used to help ensure the camera holds focus on the most important part of the subject. This is all backed up by an autofocus system that boasts a larger number of focus points than its predecessor, at 693 compared to 567, and which also covers more of the frame ( 79% vs 74%). The camera’s new AI processing unit isn’t just used for autofocusing, however. Sony claims it should also help deliver more reliable autoexposure and auto white balance , for example in shaded scenes which can be prone to blue colour casts. Colour rendition is said to be improved, too, and particularly skin tones. Another striking update lies with the in-body image stabilisation (IBIS), which is now rated for up to 8 stops of shake reduction in CIPA standard tests, compared to 5.5 stops previously. As before, the A7R V can also use its IBIS
        mechanism to create pixel-shift multi-shot images. Two options are available: a 4-shot mode which produces 60MP files with full-colour sampling at each pixel location , or a 16-shot mode that outputs massive 240MP images . The camera has to be mounted on a tripod – there’s no hand-held mode – but in a welcome move, Sony’s Imaging Edge Desktop software can now detect and compensate for image elements which move between frames. Elsewhere, though, it’s a broadly familiar tale. The 61MP full-frame sensor employs a backside-illuminated design to maximise light-gathering efficiency and provides a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-32,000 . There are also extended low settings down to ISO 50 , with an increased risk of irretrievably clipping highlight detail, and high settings up to ISO 102,400 . As before, the maximum drive speed is 10 frames per second . But the A7R V should now shoot more frames in a burst: up to 88 uncompressed raw + JPEG, or 184 compressed raw + JPEG . However, this is contingent on the storage media used, with both card slots now accepting high-speed but expensive CFexpress Type A cards, as well as UHS-II SD . One disadvantage of the A7R IV’s 61MP resolution has always been the associated storage and processing overheads. To address this, Sony has provided a wider range of image recording options, including lossless raw compression which reduces file sizes by 20%-50% with no drop in image quality. You also get the option to record lossless-compressed raw at two lower resolutions , 26MP and 15MP , makes the A7R V much better suited to more casual photography. Various other new features are found squirrelled away in the menus. An “ Anti-flicker TV scan ” function can automatically fine-tune the shutter speed to suppress colour banding effects when shooting under fluorescent or LED lighting. There’s also an option to close the shutter when the camera is switched off, to help keep dust off the sensor. Sony has included a bulb timer option in the menu for shooting long exposures with ND filters, although simply adding longer timed shutter speeds would have been a much more practical solution. There’s also a significant boost to the A7R V’s video credentials. It’s now capable of 8K recording at 24/25fps and 4K at 50/60fps, although both come with a 1.2x crop. Using the full sensor width, it can shoot in 4K at up to 30fps . The camera outputs 10-bit 4:2:2 colour, includes Sony’s S-Cinetone profile, and boasts focus breathing compensation, which maintains a constant angle of view as focus is pulled from one subject to another (as long as you’re using a Sony lens). Like almost all current models, built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi allow the camera to be connected to your phone via Sony’s free Imaging Edge Mobile app. This offers a pretty typical feature set, allowing you to copy images across to your phone for sharing on social media. Unfortunately, Sony has yet again stubbornly refused to include in-camera raw conversion, so you can’t tweak your shots before showing them off. You can also operate the camera remotely over Wi-Fi, with extensive control over exposure settings and a live view display. You can tap the phone’s screen to set the focus point, too, a simple enough feature that was bizarrely missing from older Sony models. One useful option that is missing from the app, though, is a simple Bluetooth remote release mode. Additional pro connectivity options include tethered shooting to a PC using the firm’s Imaging Edge Desktop software, either via a 5 GHz Wi-Fi or 10Gbps USB-C connection. Files can be transferred to an FTP server through Wi-Fi, USB, or a USB-tethered smartphone. You can even wire the camera to your computer and use it as a 4K webcam without installing any additional software, should you wish. Sony Alpha A7R V: Key features Sony has built upon the A7R V’s excellent predecessor, improving it in many significant ways Sony A7R V: Build and handling Unsurprisingly, the A7R V looks very much like its recent Alpha 7 siblings, with the same blocky, angular design that wastes no time on such fripperies as mere styling. Anyone who’s used a full-frame Sony since the A7R III of late 2017 onwards will already know pretty much how it works. However, compared to its predecessor, it gains an array of body design and interface updates , most of which are inherited from last year’s A7 IV. In your hand it feels solid and robust , and the extensive weather sealing means you should be able to use it with confidence on a rainy day. You still get an SLR-shaped body that’s relatively compact compared to most of its full-frame peers, with a chunky handgrip and no fewer than four electronic control dials . But in place of the dedicated exposure compensation dial, there’s now an unmarked dial that still does the same job, but whose function can be re-assigned by the user. A switch beneath the exposure mode dial selects between photo, movie, and slow/quick motion shooting, while the video record button
        moves to the top plate, making it easier to reach. I preferred to re-assign it back to focus magnification for stills shooting, mind you, like on the A7R IV. Given how the Alpha 7 design has been continually refined, it should come as no surprise to hear that the A7R V generally handles very well. The various controls are all well-placed for use with the camera up to your eye , and I found them to be sufficiently large and positive in action to be perfectly usable while wearing winter gloves. Every single control can be customised to suit the user, but I found that there’s not that much need to change things, as the most important settings are already easy to access. About my only criticism is that the two top-plate thumb dials are now quite easily confused with the camera up to your eye, as they have a very similar feel. In contrast, the exposure compensation dial on the A7R IV has firmer, more defined clicks. While other cameras have more sculpted and comfortable handgrips, the A7R V’s still gives a very secure hold, and works well with heavier lenses. However, the narrow body does mean that it’s quite tightly cramped to the lens, which some users find uncomfortable. Whether this will affect you depends both on the size of your hands, and the size of the lenses you use, so if in doubt it’s worth checking before you buy. On the A7R V, you also get Sony’s latest menu system and comprehensive touch interface . The latter is a very welcome addition, as it allows you to navigate the onscreen Fn menu and change settings much more quickly. As for the menus, they’re both prettier and more logical than before, but they’re still overwhelmingly vast, with no fewer than 55 tabs. Sony also has a bad habit of abbreviating words by missing out the vowels, leaving you guessing what some settings are supposed to mean. You certainly don’t want to be searching for functions while you’re shooting, so it makes a lot of sense to configure your most-used items into the My Menu tab. Sony A7R V: Viewfinder and screen One significant practical update comes with respect to composing and viewing your images. You now get the same 9.44m-dot electronic viewfinder that first appeared on the A7S III, with a huge 0.9x magnification. The A7R IV’s 5.76m-dot, 0.8x EVF was excellent, but the A7R V’s is sensational . Sony previews colour, white balance, exposure, and depth-of-field , which means you get a very accurate idea of how your shots are going to turn out. What you can’t do, though, is turn off all the processing to get more a neutral view resembling a DSLR’s optical viewfinder, unlike most other brands. And you still can’t display both an electronic level and live histogram at the same time, but instead have to cycle through multiple screens to see them, which is annoying. One totally new feature, for Sony at least, is the design of the rear screen. This takes the up/down tilting design used on the A7R IV and adds a side-hinged fully articulating mechanism, much like Panasonic’s design on the Lumix GH6 and Lumix S1H . As a result, it combines the discreet shooting offered by a tilting screen with the increased compositional flexibility of the articulated type, including the ability to shoot at high or low angles in portrait format. The screen itself is also larger and more detailed than before, at 3.2in and 2.1m-dot . Together, this makes for a dramatic improvement in the usability of the LCD for composing your photos, and as a result, I used it rather more than I tend to with the A7R IV. Unlike conventional vari-angle screens, this design also works perfectly well when you have an L-bracket attached to the camera, which means it’s great for landscape photography. It doesn’t add much extra bulk to the body, either. Sony Alpha A7R V: Autofocus One of the A7R V’s headline updates is its new subject-recognition autofocus system, which covers cars, trains, airplanes, humans, animals, insects, and birds. When enabled, in principle it will focus only on the specified type of subject, outlining it in the viewfinder and ignoring anything else. As the subject gets closer and larger in the frame, it’s also smart enough to home in and focus on the most important part. It’s all very clever, and it works ridiculously well. Indeed, if you’re prepared to put a little effort into mastering how the settings work – and this being Sony, they’re not necessarily very clear – this might be the most capable autofocus system around. It doesn’t matter whether your subject is static or moving erratically around the frame, the camera simply nails focus almost all the time. Whether it be shooting informal portraits at the pub, or birds in flight at the local park, I found the subject recognition worked consistently well with minimal effort on my part. This might sound lazy, but the reality is that it allows you to concentrate your efforts on composition, rather than setting up your AF system. Sony is always keen to point out that you’ll get the best C-AF performance
        with the firm’s own GM lenses, so naturally, I was keen to try it out with some less expensive optics. I tested it using the Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG DN OS , which at £900, is less than half the price of its Sony FE 100-400mm F4.5-5.6 GM OSS counterpart. Even with small, fast-moving subjects such as gulls, the autofocus still gave me plenty of tack-sharp shots, if perhaps not same percentage of keepers as you’d get with the Sony GM optic. The main irritations come with configuring the AF system to do what you want. In a long-running Sony quirk, you can’t just turn AF tracking on and off with a simple button press – instead it’s inexplicably grouped with the AF area mode settings. However, you can set the AF-ON button to also activate tracking, which makes a lot of sense. If you’re prepared to delve deeper into the camera’s workings, you can go further and register a ‘ Custom Shoot Set ’ in the Shooting menu to combine tracking with AF-C and continuous shooting, and then assign this setup to AF-ON in the Setup Menu, which is my preferred solution. You also have to select in advance what kind of subject you’re intending to shoot, using either the Fn menu or by assigning selection to a custom button. While most cameras work like this, it’s disappointing on a brand-new £4000 body, given that Canon and Nikon’s recent high-end models can now auto select between subject types. Wildlife photographers do, at least, get an option to photograph animals and birds at the same time, although not insects. But you’re not allowed to shoot humans and animals together – maybe Sony engineers don’t have pets? Thankfully, if the camera can’t find a subject of the correct type, it’ll revert to its conventional tracking instead, which is still very reliable. Sony has also included an extraordinary Subject Recognition sub-menu, in which you can fine-tune many aspects of how the system works. But not only is it massively over-complicated, the menu settings are all obtusely named. You can press the Delete key for an onscreen help page that attempts to explain each setting, but this will probably just leave you even more confused. Personally, I decided to leave it all well alone. Sony Alpha A7R V: Performance We’ve become used to Sony cameras being incredibly slick performers, and the A7R V follows suit. It’s extremely quick and responsive , and unlike previous generations, this extends just as much to the touchscreen interface as the physical controls . The result is a reliable tool that gets out of your way and does its job with the minimum of fuss. It’s pretty discreet too, with the shutter operating with a relatively quiet, unobtrusive snick . You can engage the silent electronic shutter in especially sensitive situations, but be aware that it’s rather prone to rolling shutter effects with moving subjects, along with banding under artificial light. This is one of the camera’s few real weaknesses, and I’d only use it as a last resort. While the headline burst rate is 10fps , this doesn’t quite tell the whole story. You’ll only get this speed when shooting JPEGs or compressed raw files; switch to uncompressed raw, or lossless compression, and the speed immediately drops below 7fps. At 10fps you don’t get live view between frames, either, but playback of a previous image instead, which makes tracking a moving subject almost impossible. Usually, you’re better off selecting the Hi mode, which tops out at 8fps. If shooting sports and action is your thing, you’ll still be better served by the Alpha 1 . You also need to use CFexpress Type A cards to achieve Sony’s specified buffer depths. When using UHS-II SD cards instead, I found you can expect to be able to shoot about half as many frames before the camera stutters or slows down. But this still equates to about 90 compressed raw , or 50 uncompressed raw files in a burst, which is still very impressive given the resolution. Sony’s metering is generally biased towards preserving highlight detail, which is a good strategy for users who are predominantly using raw. Indeed it’s fair to say that the A7R V really is a raw shooter’s camera . Sony’s JPEG colour processing is decidedly neutral in its intent, and while you can pep things up by switching to the Vivid (VV1) colour mode, this goes a little over the top for my tastes. The firm claims to improve its auto white balance with every release, but I found it was still overly prone to giving odd colour casts, or over-neutralising strongly-coloured scenes. Sony isn’t unique in giving the occasional AWB fail, but the difference is that you can’t fix this by re-processing the raw file in-camera. Overall, the A7R V doesn’t come close to troubling the likes of Fujifilm or Olympus/ OM System cameras in terms of consistently attractive JPEG output. However, once you pull the raw files into your preferred editor, you’ll find they are superb . While the image quality is pretty much unchanged from the A7R IV, the 61MP sensor is class-leading ,
        being capable of delivering ridiculous levels of detail at low ISOs. To get the very best results you’ll need to use high-end lenses, with Sony’s excellent FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM II being a natural companion to the camera. Likewise, I was blown away by the detail recorded in files shot using the FE 90mm F2.8 Macro G OSS . But there’s no law against trading off a bit of sharpness for convenience, and I was also very happy with images taken with my Sony FE 24-105mm F4 G OSS , even if they weren’t as bitingly sharp. You also get massive dynamic range at low ISO settings, with the ability to push shadows up by at least four stops before noise becomes problematic. Meanwhile in the highlights, you can often pull back another stop very convincingly, if not perfectly accurately. This extraordinary malleability allows you capture extreme brightness ranges in one raw file and then render it during raw processing, for example during sunrise or sunset. Sony’s updated image stabilisation is a clear improvement over previous models, too. I was able to shoot consistently sharp images hand-held towards the wide and of the FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM II zoom at shutter speeds as slow as one second , and even longer if I could find somewhere to rest my elbows. This allows you to use low ISOs in low light, and/or exploit motion blur for creative effect, without having to set up a tripod. Personally, I find it invaluable. When it comes to video, the A7R V is something of a mixed bag. One the plus side, you get that ridiculously effective autofocus system that’s capable of keeping subjects in focus as they move relative to the camera, and the option of 8K recording if you need it. However, one disadvantage of the 61MP sensor is that the 4K quality isn’t quite as detailed as cameras with resolutions around the 24MP mark, that downsample their footage from a full-sensor readout. I also found the IBIS less effective at smoothing hand-held video, and especially panning motion, compared to the best on the market. It’s by no means bad, but if you’re after a hybrid camera for both stills and video, it might not be the ideal choice. Sony Alpha A7R V: variable resolution raw and pixel-shift multi-shot As an A7R IV owner, one feature I definitely appreciated was the variable resolution raw , which allows you to record 15MP or 26MP compressed raw files when you don’t need the sensor’s full resolution. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this feature, with the Leica M11 providing something similar. On the A7R V it works seamlessly, and I couldn’t see any disadvantage to using it – you still get all the usual benefits of shooting raw, but with considerably smaller file sizes. You just need to remember to switch back to full resolution when needed. Here’s a set of comparison shots of an image shot in raw at the various available resolutions, then processed with extensive tonal adjustments (probably more than I’d normally use). These are presented as 100% crops from each resolution – click on each to open the full-size image. Pixel shift multi-shot mode works very well in its 4-shot, 60MP incarnation , giving a visible improvement in fine detail over regular single-shot files. Sony’s new motion suppression algorithm avoids ugly ghosting effects due to subject movement by painting-in affected areas with single-shot data, which is an effective approach. The main drawback lies, as usual, with practicality, as the camera always has to be mounted on a tripod. You then have to copy your raw files to your computer, identify each sequence manually in Sony’s Imaging Edge Viewer software, and combine the files to produce an ARQ composite raw file for further processing. It’s not clear why the camera can’t just produce composite raw files in-camera. I wasn’t as convinced by the 240MP mode , though, which simply doesn’t deliver as much extra detail as you might hope. It also chews up storage space alarmingly, with the 16 raw files together taking up 2GB per scene , and the final composite raw file being almost as large again. Given that 60MP should already be more than enough for almost any purpose, I’m not sure there’s much practical point to this, but it’s there if you need it. Sony A7R V: ISO and Noise The A7R V may not have a new sensor, but no other full-frame camera can surpass it in terms of image quality. When used with a high-quality lens, the level of detail it can capture is remarkable. Image files are extremely clean at ISO 100 , and there’s barely any penalty in pushing up to ISO 1600 either, with just a little luminance noise creeping in. Beyond this noise has an increasing impact, swamping the finest low-contrast detail and causing colours to desaturate. Even so, I’d be entirely happy shooting up to ISO 25,600 if necessary. But as tends to be the case, I’d avoid the extended high settings unless there really was no other alternative.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: In fact, it’s difficult to think of any situation where the Z8 wouldn’t excel. It’s robustly made and handles just as well as a pro camera should, with sufficient customisability that anyone should be able to set it up to their liking. The autofocus system is breathtakingly quick and reliable while being easy and intuitive to use – indeed of the thousands of images I shot, pretty much every single one was properly focused. Throw in the effective in-body stabilisation and excellent image quality, and if you can’t get super-sharp shots with the Nikon Z8, then it’s really not the camera’s fault. Compared to the Z9, there are barely any compromises. Yes, the battery life is shorter, but it’s still absolutely fine for most purposes. Meanwhile, serious sports shooters might be put off by the mismatched card slots, and prefer the Z9’s meatier grip for use with large lenses. But I suspect more users will be pleased by the option to use cheaper SD cards. So while there are still some perfectly legitimate reasons to go for the Z9, for most potential buyers, the Z8 is now the obvious choice. Of course, it’s still expensive, and it’s really not that small, which means landscape shooters might prefer to stick with their Z7 IIs. But there’s certainly a case to be made that the Nikon Z8 eclipses its Canon and Sony rivals, and might just be the most accomplished all-rounder among all the high-end mirrorless cameras currently available.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Nikon’s latest high-end full-frame mirrorless camera, the Nikon Z8 , offers essentially the same specifications as the flagship Nikon Z9 , but in a significantly smaller and less expensive body. With an impressive combination of high resolution , high speed , and cutting-edge autofocus , all wrapped up in a rugged pro-spec body, it’s a camera that should be able to take on any conceivable task. Without doubt it’s one of the best Nikon mirrorless cameras to date. However, ‘smaller and less expensive’ doesn’t by any means ‘small and cheap’ – the Z8 is still a hefty camera, and at $3,999 / £3,999 body-only, it’s a serious investment. Nikon is pitching it as a ‘true successor to the D850’, which is quite a claim given that the Nikon D850 was probably the best DSLR ever made. Nikon Z8 at a glance: Compared to its major competitors, though, the Nikon Z 8 looks like quite a bargain. This is a camera that can shoot 45.7MP raw files at 20 frames per second, while recognising and tracking focus on specific subjects. It can also record 8K video at 30fps. Perhaps its clearest direct rivals are the Sony Alpha A1 , which shoots 50MP stills at 30fps and costs $6,500 / £5,879, and the Canon EOS R5 , which offers 45MP at 20fps for $3,800 / £4,299. But neither of these older models has quite such a sophisticated AF system. Indeed, possibly the biggest question posed by the Z8 relates to its stablemate, the Z9. A detailed line-by-line spec comparison reveals that the supposedly junior model is a match for its $5,500 / £5,300 sibling in pretty much every aspect of its operation, aside from battery life. So the question we need to address is whether the Nikon Z8 really is as good as it looks, and if so, why would anyone now spend all that extra cash on the Z9? Let’s dig in and find out. Nikon Z 8: Features In terms of its major photographic specifications, the Z 8 is essentially a direct match for the Z 9. This means you get the same excellent 45.7MP full-frame sensor , which offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 64-25,600 . This is extendable to ISO 32-102,400, but at the risk of clipped highlights at low ISOs, and excessive image noise at the top settings. The fastest shutter speed is an action-freezing 1/32,000sec , while at the other end of the scale, landscape photographers can enable timed exposures as long as 15 minutes in manual mode. Crucially, the Z8’s sensor is of the stacked CMOS type, with a super-fast readout speed. This is so effective at suppressing the usual image-quality problems associated with electronic shutters that the camera doesn’t need a mechanical shutter at all. As a result, it can shoot bursts at up to 20 frames per second in raw, 30fps in JPEG, and fully 120fps in 11MP JPEG. To make file handling more manageable, there’s a high efficiency raw format which significantly reduces file sizes without any loss of detail or processing flexibility Subject recognition autofocus is available, with the camera capable of recognising people, animals (including cats, dogs, and birds), and vehicles (cars, motorbikes, bicycles, trains, and airplanes). As on the Z9, you don’t necessarily have to specify a subject type in advance, but can allow the camera to choose between the available options automatically. As with Nikon’s other full-frame models, both stills and video shooters benefit from in-body image stabilisation , which promises up to 6 stops of shake reduction. It also works in concert with optically stabilised lenses. Another notable feature shared with the Z9 is a shield to protect the sensor when the camera is switched off, which will be welcome for anyone changing lenses in dusty conditions. Videographers are well served too, with the ability to record in 8K resolution at 30fps or 4K at 120 fps. Nikon claims you can record for at least 90 minutes without overheating (however, the Z 9 is slated to keep going for a further 30min). There’s a whole host of high-end video features on board, including both N-RAW and ProRes RAW formats with 12-bit colour. You get a full-size HDMI output along with 3.5mm microphone and headphone ports. Compared to the Z9, the most obvious spec difference comes in terms of battery life . The Z 8 uses Nikon’s familiar EN-EL15C battery, which is rated for 340 shots per charge, less than half the Z 9’s 740-shot stamina from its larger EN-EL18D battery. But you can buy an add-on MB-N12 vertical grip for the Z8 that takes a second battery for $349 / £349, almost doubling the shooting time. It’s possible to power the camera via USB-C, too. Another major difference between the cameras is that while both have two card slots , the Z8 takes one CFexpress (or XQD) card and one UHS-II SD, as opposed to the Z9’s twin CFexpress /XQD slots. This means Z9 users can back-up files to both cards with no speed penalty, but have to pay a lot extra for the privilege, as CFexpress cards are considerably more expensive. Physically, the Z8 also lacks a flash PC-sync socket and an RJ-45
        network port, however you can still get ethernet connectivity via a USB-C adapter. As usual, both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are built in for smartphone connectivity, via Nikon’s SnapBridge app. You can operate the camera using your phone, via either a simple Bluetooth release or a comprehensive Wi-Fi remote control. You can also copy across your pictures for sharing on social media. It’s even possible to transfer every single image you take to your phone automatically, although on a camera capable of shooting at 120fps, that may not be a good idea. Nikon Z8 Key features: Nikon Z8: Build and handling Compared to the Z 9, the most obvious change comes with respect to the body design , with the Z 8 doing without an integrated vertical grip. Measuring 144 x 118.5 x 83 mm and weighing in at 910g , it’s distinctly smaller and more portable than its big brother, but in your hand, but it feels every bit as tough. Compared to Nikon’s other 45.7MP models, it’s smaller than the D850 DSLR, but rather larger and heavier than the Nikon Z7 II . In particular, it’s unusually tall compared to other full-frame mirrorless models. However, two Z 8 bodies will still weigh less than a Z9 and Z7 II, which is a popular pairing among Nikon shooters. In terms of control layout , the Z8 mirrors the Z9 very closely, which means it’ll feel instantly familiar to existing users of pro-level Nikon Z-system or DSLR cameras. There are the usual front and rear control dials, while practically every available surface is covered in buttons, giving direct access to all the most important settings. It has the same top-plate status panel, and benefits from illuminated buttons on the rear, which is great for shooting in low light. All the buttons and dials are well placed, and once you get used to how it works, it offers quick access to every setting you need while shooting. By default, shutter speed and aperture are controlled using the rear and front dials respectively, with buttons just behind the shutter release for ISO and exposure compensation . Falling under the arc of your right thumb, there’s an AF-ON button, joystick multicontroller for moving the focus point, and the ‘i’ button which allows many secondary settings to be changed with the camera up to your eye. Focus mode and AF area settings are easily changed via a button that’s handily placed on the front left corner of the body. Two customisable buttons between the handgrip and the lens mount switch between custom camera setups (known as Shooting Menu Banks) and image area settings. The latter provides an easy means of engaging the 20MP DX crop mode, which I used a lot. There are, however, a few detail changes in the Nikon Z8 compared to the Z9 . The Z8 does without a drive mode dial on the top left, with this function now controlled entirely from the drive button. In practice, I found this to be an improvement, as it’s quicker to select the shooting speed you want using the front and rear dials. The white balance button has also moved to the top-left cluster, displacing flash mode from the physical control set. The control setup is highly customisable , which means most users should be able to set up the camera to suit their personal needs. If, for example, you’d prefer to make the Z8 behave like a Canon DSLR, with exposure compensation controlled from the rear dial, that’s just a few menu settings away. Many of the buttons can be customised too, for example allowing different AF area modes to be recalled quickly, which is handy for sports and action shooting. It’s even possible to configure buttons to change a whole group of settings with a single press, using the ‘Recall shooting functions’ option. But annoyingly, the ability to switch from AF-S to AF-C is missing here. In principle, the Z8’s Shooting Menu Banks are a handy way of switching quickly between camera configurations for different shooting scenarios. But bizarrely, the Z8 inherits the same limitation as the Z9, in that it’s not possible to include the drive mode, despite the lack of a physical dial for this setting. My workaround was to use the Continuous Low option, setting 1fps for static subjects and 10fps as the start point for those that move. This works pretty well for me, but obviously isn’t ideal. Also, while you can give the settings banks meaningful names, the camera won’t show these onscreen when switching between them via the Fn1 button. The external controls are all nicely complemented by the touchscreen , which provides a quick means of operating the ‘i’ menu, and navigating and changing main menu settings. Nikon’s menu system is as vast and complex as you might expect, so if there are settings here that you revisit frequently, it’s worth taking the time to assemble them into a custom My Menu. Nikon Z8: Viewfinder and Screen Continuing with the general theme of this review, the Z8 provides essentially the same excellent viewfinder and screen arrangement as the Z9. So you get a truly excellent 3.69m-dot electronic
        viewfinder with 0.8x magnification, which provides blackout-free viewing during continuous shooting. A subtle flickering frame around the edge of the preview image provides visual feedback that the camera is shooting. By default, Nikon previews colour processing, simulates exposure across a +/-3 EV range, and previews depth-of-field at apertures down to f/5.6. This display behaviour can be adjusted using the View Mode (photo LV) menu setting, with options to neutralise colour, disable exposure preview, and brighten shadows, which together can give a view more like a DSLR’s optical viewfinder. You can assign a custom button to switch between preview settings, and I found this useful in high-contrast situations such as sunsets, as it allows you to see detail that would otherwise be hidden in dark shadows. Meanwhile, landscape photographers can assign depth-of-field preview to a custom button for use with smaller apertures. It’s also possible show an array of exposure and compositional aids, including a live histogram, electronic levels, and gridlines. You also get the same 3.2in, 2.1m-dot rear screen as the Z9. This boasts a four-hinge arrangement that allows it to be tilted up and down for low-angle or overhead shooting in both portrait and landscape formats, which is a significant advantage over the Z7 II. To my mind, this is the best screen articulation layout for shooting stills. However, unlike a side-hinged unit, it can’t be set to face forwards for video shooting. That’s perhaps the only questionable design decision on a camera that Nikon is touting for its movie credentials. Nikon Z8: Autofocus Probably the biggest innovation in camera technology over the past couple of years has been subject detection autofocus . Nikon’s implementation on the Z8 (and Z9) is without doubt one of the best around. It can identify and focus specifically on people, animals or vehicles, and you can either specify a particular subject type, or let the camera choose between them automatically. It’s easy to use and works extremely well. If you know that you want to shoot only a particular kind of object – for example aircraft at an airshow – you can set the camera to prioritise the autofocus accordingly, and essentially ignore anything else. But otherwise, you can usually just leave the system set to Auto and let it do its thing. Detected subjects will be outlined in the viewfinder, and when there are multiple options in the frame, you can choose between them quickly using the joystick. It’s all very quick and intuitive to use. If the subject detection system can’t find anything, the camera will fall back on its conventional autofocus setup, which provides all the options you’d expect. You can choose between multiple focus point sizes, including three customisable rectangle settings, and place them anywhere in the frame. Nikon’s 3D tracking is also on board for following subjects that the AF system won’t recognise of its own accord. Looking back over the thousands of images I shot using the Nikon Z8, primarily with the Nikkor Z 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 VR S , what’s striking is just how high the AF system’s hit-rate is. Whether it was track cycling, water birds, or vintage fighter aircraft, I found it genuinely hard to find a shot that was clearly out of focus. Its prowess with birds in flight isn’t limited to larger, easier targets, as it also worked perfectly well with faster, more erratic species such as ducks or gulls. One point worth noting, though, is that with small, distant subjects, it’s worth switching to DX crop mode as the subject recognition works appreciably better. The system isn’t infallible, of course; I found it occasionally lost track of eyes, or when photographing waterfowl, focused on the reflection rather than the bird itself. But overall, the Z8’s autofocus is a huge step beyond anything most Nikon users will have experienced before, unless they’ve used the Z9. Nikon Z8: Performance As a camera that aims to supplant the D850 in diehard Nikon users’ kit bags, the Z8 needs to satisfy the needs of demanding photographers. After a couple of weeks intensive use, I can only conclude it’ll do so with ease. In fact, this is a camera that’s so phenomenally capable that it did everything I asked of it without any problem at all. No matter what the shooting scenario, I struggled find any way of stressing it. Operationally, it’s super-fast and responsive, while delivering excellent results in terms of image quality, shot after shot. With no mechanical shutter, it can be completely silent in operation, although personally I preferred to turn on the faux-shutter sound for audible feedback most of the time. Crucially there’s no problem with rolling shutter distortion, even with rapidly moving objects such as propeller blades. Nikon’s metering is generally reliable, and it’s easy to see in the viewfinder when you might need to apply any exposure compensation. There’s a bewildering choice of Auto White Balance options,
        and the default setting really isn’t to my taste, as it frequently over-neutralises strong colours. But if you switch to Natural Light Auto, you’ll get consistently more attractive results, aided by Nikon’s typically bright and punchy JPEG colour output. While the Z8’s continuous shooting is incredibly impressive, you do need to invest in CFexpress Type B cards to get the very best performance – at least if you want to shoot at 20fps in full-resolution raw. Then it’ll just keep on going until the card is full, perhaps throttling the speed back a little if necessary. This is where Nikon’s high efficiency raw format pays dividends, with the reduced file sizes allowing rapid writing to card. However, the camera  also behaves very sensibly with slower XQD or SD cards . Set to 20fps, it will shoot a rapid burst of images for several seconds, and then settle down to shooting at whatever speed the card can sustain. Drop the speed to 10fps – which frankly is more than fast enough for most subjects – and it’ll probably keep on shooting at that rate almost indefinitely, at least with a fast enough SD card (I used Lexar’s latest Professional 2000x 128GB UHS-II SD , rated for 300MB/s). You’ll also get almost unlimited high-speed bursts in DX crop mode with fast SD cards. While battery life is on paper the only question mark compared the Z9, in practice I didn’t find it a problem at all. That 340 shots per charge rating uses the CIPA standard test, which reflects shooting individual frames at fixed intervals. But if instead you shoot a lot of bursts, you can get many times more than that. On one occasion I shot over 1600 frames off a single charge, with the battery indicator showing plenty in reserve at the end of the day. Nikon’s in-body image stabilisation works extremely well, and I was able to get sharp hand-held images at shutter speeds as slow as 1 second using the Nikkor Z 24-120mm f/4 S at 38mm. At such slow shutter speeds, I also got much better results using the standard IS mode, rather than the default ‘Sports’ mode which is designed for panning with telephoto lenses. One point worth noting though, is that, unlike a lot of modern systems, with the Nikon Z8 it’s best to turn off IBIS when using a tripod , especially with shutter speeds in the 1/10sec to 1sec range – otherwise you risk pixel-level blurring. Of course, raw image quality is absolutely superb, with the 45.7MP sensor delivering on all fronts of detail rendition, dynamic range, and high-ISO noise. You may not quite get the highest pixel count currently available on a full-frame camera, but you should still be able to make critically sharp prints up to 27 x 18 inches in size, at least. Even the 60MP Sony Alpha A7R V only provides 15% greater linear resolution. That massive pixel count also gives great scope for cropping, which really is useful for distant subjects such as wildlife. At low ISOs, raw files have such great dynamic range that you can adjust exposure and shadows sliders in raw processing almost with impunity. If there’s any difference compared to other high-end full frame models, including the Z7 II, it’s not of any practical importance. I was also perfectly happy shooting at ISO settings up to the top standard setting of ISO 25,600, especially with the latest AI-based noise reduction algorithms from the likes of Adobe and DxO . Video quality is likewise excellent, even directly out of the camera with no editing. Again, it benefits from impressive levels of detail and Nikon’s attractive colour processing. The in-body image stabilisation does a good job of smoothing out minor jitters, and the built-in microphones give very acceptable sound quality. But like on most cameras, they are prone to being affected by even light wind outdoors, where it’s advisable to use an external microphone with a windshield. Nikon Z8: ISO and noise Thanks to its 45.7MP sensor, the Z 8 captures an impressive amount of detail, surpassed only by a few 61MP models among its full-frame peers. There’s no visible noise at ISO 64, and even at ISO 1600, you have to examine files close-up onscreen to make out the first appreciable appearance of luminance noise. Fine detail starts to blur away at ISO 6400, but it’s only when you hike the sensitivity to ISO 25,600 that noise really has a major negative impact on image quality. However, the extended ISO 51,200 and ISO 102,400 settings are best avoided, as they suffer from excessive noise and lose almost all shadow detail.

      value: 'Canon EOS 90D review: Features The EOS 80D’s 24.2-million-pixel APS-C CMOS sensor has been replaced by an all-new 32.5-million-pixel CMOS chip, which is also used inside Canon’s latest EOS M series camera the EOS M6 Mark II and the newer RF-mount EOS R7. Whereas the EOS 80D offered an ISO range of ISO 100-16,000 (expandable to ISO 25,600), the EOS 90D’s sensor goes one better in the way it shoots between ISO 100-25,600, expandable to ISO 51,200. As we’ve seen on Canon’s latest flurry of advanced compacts, the sensor works alongside Canon’s DIGIC 8 image processor, which contributes to faster data processing and a healthy increase in continuous shooting speed. Whereas the EOS 70D and EOS 80D let you shoot a continuous burst at up to 7fps, this has now risen to 10fps with autofocus tracking when using the viewfinder and 11fps when using Live View with fixed AF. To put this into context, it can now keep up with the EOS 7D Mark II, albeit with a smaller buffer. Canon claims it can sustain 58 JPEGs or 25 Raw files at 10fps before its limit is reached. Those who remember the EOS 70D will recall it being Canon’s first DSLR to feature Dual Pixel CMOS AF. This revolutionary technology was lauded such a success, no time was wasted introducing it to other models across the EOS line up. In a nutshell, Dual Pixel CMOS AF supports sensor-based, phase detection autofocus. The system works by splitting all the effective pixels across the sensor into two individual photodiodes – one for left and one for right. By measuring the difference in light that reaches each of the two diodes, the EOS 90D can perform on-sensor phase detection focusing both in Live View and during video recording, overcoming the sluggish Live View focusing performance associated with Canon DSLRs that predate 2013. Keeping on the subject of autofocus, the EOS 90D adopts the same AF system from the EOS 80D . Out of the 45 all cross-type AF points on offer, 27 are f/8 compatible, with the centre point being sensitive down to f/2.8. The working range of the autofocus hasn’t changed either and continues to operate across a -3EV-18EV range. Whereas the EOS 80D inherited Canon’s Canon’s 7,560-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor from the EOS 750D and EOS 760D, the EOS 90D presents a 220,000-pixel RGB+IR exposure sensor. This should see it dissect and analyse scenes even more effectively for consistent and accurate exposure metering. Evaluative metering is linked to all AF points, with partial and spot metering covering approximately 6.5% and 2% of the viewfinder respectively. Exposure compensation is controlled across a range of +/- 5EV in 1/3 or 1/2 stop increments. Canon doesn’t officially quote shutter actuation figures for the EOS 90D, however if the electronically controlled focal-plane shutter is similar to the EOS 80D’s, you can should expect a shutter lifespan of around 100,000 shots. If you’d like to exceed the 1/8000sec maximum shutter speed, such as when you find yourself wanting to shoot with a fast aperture in sunny conditions, you can shoot at up to 1/16000sec by entering Live View and activating the electronic shutter. Coming out of Live View after shooting at 1/16000sec automatically sees the mechanical shutter reset back to 1/8000sec. Those who regularly use long exposures can set the camera to bulb mode and trigger it with a hard-wired remote controller like the Canon TC80N3 with RA-E3 adapter, or use a wireless remote controller like the BR-E1. Alternatively, users may wish to take advantage of Canon’s Camera Connect app for iOS and Android for free and use it to start/stop the exposure whilst referring to a useful in-built timer. Compared to the Canon EOS 70D and Canon EOS 80D , which have only ever offered the ability to shoot movies at Full HD (1920×1080) resolution, the EOS 90D is the first double-digit EOS DSLR to feature 4K video recording. Most importantly it uses the full width of the sensor with no crop. Videographers can shoot 4K video at 30/25p and Full HD video at up to 120fps. Those who’d like to monitor audio levels will be pleased to read that both headphone and microphone inputs are supported, which are located at the side behind the same rubber flap. This is a decent enough set of specs even today, and pretty unique amongst DSLR designs. Other points of interest include a single card slot at the side that accepts UHS-II SD cards, which seems somewhat mean since many recent rivals have two, and the acceptance of Canon’s high stamina LP-E6N battery. Battery economy has improved too – up from 960 shots on the EOS 80D to 1300 shots based on CIPA testing. This is one respect where the EOS 90D still has a clear advantage over the newer EOS R7. Users who’d like to extend battery life still further can also load two batteries via the BG-E14 ($190 / £174) battery grip, which is the same that the EOS 70D and EOS 80D use. Canon EOS 90D review: Connectivity The Bluetooth connection can also instruct the camera to fire up its Wi-Fi
        for when you want to copy images across to your phone, or use full remote control with live view. The auto transfer option, which automatically downloads images taken with the camera to a smartphone connected via Wi-fi works well and you’re given the option to select a reduced image size (1620×1080 pixels) to prevent large size files filling your smartphone too quickly. Compared to some cameras, the EOS 90D’s connectivity is straightforward and quick to setup. You get an easy connection guide from the home page of the Camera Connect app that walks you through the steps involved. Canon EOS 90D review: Build & Handling Canon’s double digit DSLR’s have shared much of a likeness for many years. The 70D wasn’t vastly different to the 60D and the 80D, which introduced a slightly enlarged thumb rest, had much the same look as the 70D. Glance at the 90D from the front and you immediately start questioning if any changes have been made at all. On closer inspection you’ll notice the button to raise the pop-up flash protrudes slightly more and there aren’t as many holes for the in-built microphone. Turning our attention to the top plate, the rather plasticky top plate dial has been replaced by one that has a better-knurled texture, but in most other respects it’s identical to the 80D. The buttons to take control of AF mode, drive mode, ISO and metering are all laid out the same, with the small button that’s positioned between the top plate dial and shutter button being well placed to quickly cycle through the AF area modes. In total there are nine custom controls, however the AF area button isn’t one you can reassign to a different function. On the left shoulder of the body you’ll find the mode dial with lock button within to prevent it being moved accidentally. The On/Off switch is positioned below the mode dial again like so many of Canon’s DSLRs. Though it’s not as natural to use as an On/Off switch that encircles the shutter button, you do quickly get used to flicking it with your left thumb. The most significant change to the 90D’s body is found at the rear. After many years of not seeing a multi-controller joystick at the rear of a double-digit EOS DSLR it’s great to see one added again. You may recall that a joystick featured on the EOS 20D, 30D, 40D and 50D, but was then removed from the EOS 60D, 70D and 80D, forcing those who wanted one to look at more advanced EOS models. The joystick is positioned where the Quick menu button used to be on the 80D, so this has now been relocated a little lower to the right. The playback button that was positioned above the multi control dial has now been moved below it, which in turn sees the lock switch move across to the right a bit. The purpose of the lock switch is to prevent unintentional changes to exposure compensation and exposure settings by moving the multi control dial. It doesn’t physically lock (the wheel will still turn) but it does turns off the function. Enthusiasts who’d like to intuitively shift the AF point around the frame will really appreciate having the multi-controller joystick on the EOS 90D. Going back to using the 80D and having to tap the directional buttons to get the AF point where you want it to be highlights how much faster and more intuitive focus point positioning is on the 90D. The other benefit of the joystick is that it makes for a great way of quickly navigating the menu. To confirm menu settings, or reposition the AF point back to the centre of the frame, simply push the joystick inwards. The body is constructed from a blend of aluminium alloy and polycarbonate resin with glass fiber. There’s no sign of creaking or squeaking when it’s gripped tightly and though you can tell it’s not as solid as pro-spec EOS models, it feels well put together and robust enough for those it’s designed for. As a camera that’s likely to fall into the hands of countless wildlife, sports and outdoors photographers who might get caught out in wet weather, it was vital for Canon to ensure the body is weather sealed. Canon doesn’t provide any information about exactly how many weather seals feature in the construction, but most importantly they do a good job. Using the 90D outdoors in persistent drizzle for more than two hours caused no harm and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the touchscreen is just as responsive to use when it’s covered in water droplets as when it’s dry, which can’t be said for all cameras. Another thing that’ll appeal is how easy it is for existing Canon users to pick up the 90D and immediately feel at home with it. It won’t feel intimidating for anyone upgrading from an entry-level EOS model and neither does it feel too big a step down from an advanced EOS DSLR like the EOS 7D Mark II . There isn’t a huge difference in weight between the 90D (701g) and 80D (730g), but a saving in weight is better than no saving at all. It’s one of the lightest double-digit EOS DSLRs to be made, second to that of the EOS 30D (700g). Canon EOS 90D
        review: Viewfinder and Screen The optical viewfinder, like the 80D, offers 100% frame coverage with 0.95x magnification and -3 to +1 m-1 dioptre correction. Exposure variables are clearly displayed along the bottom and if you head into the viewfinder display options in the menu you can choose to display an electronic level, grid display as well as a Flicker detection warning. Unlike many electronic viewfinders found on mirrorless cameras though, it doesn’t rotate this information when you shoot in the portrait format. As for the screen, it’s the same 3in, 1040k-dot vari-angle touchscreen we’ve seen on many Canon DSLRs before. It displays a good, clean feed to assist composition and video recording in Live View. Images are well displayed in playback mode too. Colours are faithful and you get four thumbnail views to quickly search through hundreds of images on the memory card. Having the option of pulling the screen out and tilting it to your preferred angle gives it a distinct advantage over a fixed screen when attempting to shoot from low or high angles. Those with observant eyes will also notice the cut out that helps users pull the screen out when it’s folded back into the camera is now positioned at the top corner rather than at the side. As we’ve become used to on Canon’s most recent DSLRs, the touch screen is very responsive and reacts to the lightest of touches when it’s used to navigate the menus, select different settings or zoom and swipe through images in playback mode. There is the option to increase the sensitivity from standard to sensitive, but it’s hard to decipher a difference between them. If you find the touchscreen more of a hindrance than it is helpful, it can be disabled from the touch control settings. Canon EOS 90D review: Performance The 90D’s layout of 45 autofocus points is grouped quite tightly in the viewfinder. The central gathering of AF points are arranged in a 3×5 grid with the top and bottom line sitting a fraction higher than the two groups of 15 AF points either side. You’re required to press the AF selection button first before you’re able to shift the AF point around the frame. If you’d prefer to move the AF point instantly with the joystick you’ll need to enter the CnFn III Operation/Others option in the menu, head to the Custom Controls and change the function of the Multi-controllers from off to direct AF point selection. I’m quite surprised it’s not setup this way as default as I can see many users expecting it to operate this way straight out of the box. In situations where you’d like to focus close to the edge of the frame where there isn’t an AF point you’ll either need to focus and recompose or switch over to shooting in Live View. In the latter you’re provided with much wider 100×88% vertical and horizontal frame coverage with as many as 5481 AF positions to choose from. As well as spot AF, 1-point AF and Zone AF, there’s also tracking AF in Live View, with the option to turn face and eye detection on from a touch of the the Info button. Real-world testing revealed the 90D can identify and track faces effectively, even at long distances. Eye detection becomes active within approximately 2m of a person, with the smaller of two white squares indicating which eye the camera has locked onto. You can tell the camera which eye you’d prefer it to focus on by flicking the joystick left and right, but you will notice that Eye detection becomes less effective when the person you’re photographing turns and isn’t facing the camera straight on. I was particularly impressed by the success rate of sharp shots I managed to achieve in low light when shooting indoor go-karts approaching head-on using the viewfinder. Sports and wildlife users will appreciate the advanced autofocus settings on offer too such as the option to refine the responsiveness of the tracking sensitivity, although being able to choose from various AF case sensitivities for different subjects is a feature that remains exclusive to higher-end EOS models. Reliable metering is another of the 90D’s strengths. You can trust the camera to deliver well-exposed images in evaluative metering mode and I rarely found myself having to dial in more than -1EV to prevent highlights being clipped in the brightest areas. For scenes where evaluative metering isn’t the best option, there’s also partial, spot and centre weighted to choose from. If you happen to underexpose an image a little too far for the highlights, the 90D’s wide dynamic range gives you the scope to pull detail back at the editing stage without introducing unbearable levels of noise. It goes without saying the number of shots that one can get out of the battery pack depends on many different factors, such as the temperature of the environment the camera is used in and how often power-hungry functions like Wi-fi are turned on. Checking the battery info when the battery icon began to blink told me you can get close to the estimated 1300 shots per charge if
        you use the viewfinder for a majority of your shooting. While this battery life is impressive and surpasses many smaller mirrorless cameras, it’s let down slightly by the fact a newer USB Type-C interface for in-camera charging, like you get on Canon’s EOS R models, isn’t supported. Canon also provides a good amount of control over image processing settings. The default Auto picture style determines what it thinks is the best processing and rendering settings for any given scene and there are seven other picture styles to choose from that can be tweaked to your liking. If you’d like your shots to reflect the scene naturally as you see it with your eyes, faithful or neutral are a great place to start. Hit the Quick menu button in playback mode and you’ll be presented by a number of icons on either side of the screen, processing raw files in-camera and ranking multiple images with a one to five star rating being two such examples. Loading the 90D with a UHS-II card and testing its speed performance resulted in 25 raw files being captured at 10fps using the viewfinder before its buffer was reached. Switching the file format over to Canon’s C-Raw format saw this number rise to 40 frames. Firing off a burst of large JPEGs resulted in 52 images being recorded to our card before the buffer required a breather. For the sport, action and wildlife photographers Canon is aiming the camera at, this buffer performance is a little underwhelming, though we must remember we’re looking at an enthusiast camera here, not a pro-spec model. Ultimately, users will need to judge when to start shooting a burst carefully to ensure the buffer limit isn’t reached partway through an action sequence. Canon EOS 90D review: Image quality The EOS 90D still offers the joint highest resolution of any APS-C camera on the market, alongside the Canon EOS M6 Mark II and EOS R7 , with the move from 24.2-million-pixels to 32.5-million-pixels being quite a jump. Canon has once again opted to overlay the sensor with an optical low-pass filter to help keep moire and false colour artefacts under control. While this does come at the expense of some finer image detail, users will be enthralled by the quality of the 90D’s images when they’re inspected at high magnification. Sports and wildlife photographers will be especially grateful for the increased pixel count when they need to crop tightly. There’s excellent latitude when you’d like to return detail too. Raw files let you to pull back a lot of information from deep shadowed regions, which is great for times when you’d like to underexpose for high contrast scenes in order to prevent highlight detail blowing out and being lost. Canon EOS 90D Review: Resolution A close inspection of our resolution chart tells us the EOS 90D’s new sensor resolves a very creditable 3,700l/ph at its base sensitivity of ISO 100. Detail remains high at low sensitivity settings; with resolution figures of 3,600l/ph and 3,400l/ph recorded at ISO 200 and ISO 400 respectively. Push higher into the ISO range and you’ll start to observe fine detail being affected by noise. We recorded 3,100l/ph at ISO 3200 and 2,900l/ph at ISO 6400. The sensor can resolve 2,600l/ph at ISO 12,800 and 2,400l/ph at ISO 25,600 before expansion, with detail dropping right off at ISO 51,000 (2,100l/ph). From the crops below, multiply the number below the lines by 200 to calculate the resolution of lines per picture height. Canon EOS 90D Review: Noise A greater number of pixels on the same sensor surface area risks more noise at pixel level, yet the EOS 90D controls noise well up to ISO 3200 and ISO 6400, putting in a respectable performance. For optimum results you’ll want to shoot in Raw and work between ISO 100 and ISO 400 where you’ll be presented with clean images that are noise free. Luminance noise can be observed at ISO 800 and ISO 1600, but detail isn’t affected too heavily at these settings so you can use them confidently. ISO 3200 is perfectly useable too provided some noise reduction applied during post processing. I’d say this is the upper limit of where I’d want to push to on a regular basis though as fine detail does take more of a hit at ISO 6400 and ISO 8000. Increased noise at ISO 12,800 impinges fine detail and although vibrancy and saturation holds up well at ISO 25,600 and ISO 51,200, both these settings should be avoided. Canon EOS 90D Review: Verdict The Canon EOS 90D is a versatile and reliable DSLR, capable of producing excellent images in a multitude of different shooting situations. Although launched back in 2019, its specifications, features and performance are still relevant today, especially for Canon fans who prefer the DSLR design to mirrorless. A lot of talk is centred on new sensor, which resolves a level of detail exceeding anything recorded from an APS-C camera previously. The increase in resolution will be of great benefit to sports, action and wildlife photographers who crop into their images, however to get
        the best out of the sensor and do it justice you’ll really want to pair it with higher quality lenses than the kit zooms Canon sells it with, including the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM. Uncropped 4K video has been long overdue on Canon’s double-digit DSLRs, so it’s good to see it making an appearance, albeit without a 24p setting and a Log gamma option for colour grading. I’d have liked to see Canon add a USB Type C interface with support for USB charging like its EOS R mirrorless range, but unfortunately it goes without. Its saving grace is its large LP-E6N battery, which with its 1300-shot stamina, won’t have you rushing to find mains power to recharge it. Being able to shoot a continuous burst at 10fps is great to have, however the older Canon EOS 7D Mark II still has the edge when it comes to buffer performance, plus it offers dual card slots whereas the 90D only has one. The 90D’s optical viewfinder is big and bright, but the AF system is starting to show its age. To benefit from wider AF coverage, better focus accuracy and focus aids such as Face and Eye Detection, you’ll find yourself engaging Live View and using the rear screen more than you thought you might. Ergonomically, the 90D feels great. The large handgrip lets you wrap your hand around it to get a secure hold when it’s used with large telephoto lenses and its weather resistance gives you confidence to keep shooting when the weather takes a turn for the worse. In addition, the newly added joystick complements the intuitive layout of controls and dials across the body, making it quick to setup and shoot with when there’s no time to waste. Those who are after a camera that’s more compact may be inclined to look at the Canon EOS M6 Mark II , which shares the same sensor/processor combination as the 90D and shoots even faster, though with the arrival of the RF-mount EOS R10 and R7, it looks like Canon’s M-series cameras are headed for an evolutionary dead-end. Photographers who’ve built up a selection of EF lenses, fancy having a more extensive lens lineup available to them, and still prefer using an optical viewfinder as opposed to an EVF, will be be well served by the 90D. In today’s world of mirrorless it makes a refreshing change to see a DSLR still competing with them on pretty much equal terms. For advancing amateurs and keen enthusiasts alike, the Canon EOS 90D makes a sound choice. Is it the best APS-C enthusiast DSLR Canon has made? Yes it is, but it might also be one of the last if Canon decides to pull the plug on manufacturing DSLRs and shifts its focus to mirrorless and mirrorless only – and with the R10 and R7 the signs are that this may already have happened.'

      value: 'The Canon EOS 90D was Canon’s newest DSLR in 2019, and it now looks as if it might have been its last, as Canon moves focus towards mirrorless cameras. But with a high-resolution 32.5MP APS-C sensor, could the 90D be one of the best Canon DSLRs ? Canon EOS 90D at a glance: We were intrigued to see Canon release a new APS-C DSLR in 2019 at the same time as it continued to evolve its mirrorless systems is intriguing. It showed Canon’s intent on strengthening its EOS DSLR line up at the same time as developing its EOS M and EOS mirrorless range, but the situation has changed considerably since then. The EOS 90D was Canon’s newest DSLR back then and it now looks as if it might have been its last. The key development has been the arrival of Canon’s RF-mount APS-C models, notably the Canon EOS R7 , which looks to be the modern mirrorless successor to the EOS 90D. Nevertheless the Canon EOS DSLR range continues, and our guide to the best Canon DSLRs shows the top choices available today. All have access to a larger number of Canon-made and third-party lenses, and our guide to the best Canon EF lenses picks out some of the best. Canon’s DSLR development had already slowed. The EOS 90D arrived three years after Canon last refreshed its double-digit series of DSLRs. It’s the successor to the popular EOS 80D and is out to appeal to enthusiast photographers who’d like a versatile workhorse for all genres, as well as advanced amateurs who may feel they’ve outgrown their entry-level DSLR and would like to take the next step towards progressing their photography. Let’s not forget that even now there are many that prefer DSLR handling and viewing systems to mirrorless cameras, so the EOS 90D is likely to find a willing audience, even today. And for the time being at least, there’s a far wider range of EF-S lenses available for the 90D than the R7, though you can use Canon’s EF-S lens adaptor to use them on the R7 too. Before commenting on how the Canon EOS 90D performs and offering our verdict, let’s first remind ourselves of what’s new compared to the EOS 80D. Canon EOS 90D review: Features The EOS 80D’s 24.2-million-pixel APS-C CMOS sensor has been replaced by an all-new 32.5-million-pixel CMOS chip, which is also used inside Canon’s latest EOS M series camera the EOS M6 Mark II and the newer RF-mount EOS R7.

        the 1/8000sec maximum shutter speed, such as when you find yourself wanting to shoot with a fast aperture in sunny conditions, you can shoot at up to 1/16000sec by entering Live View and activating the electronic shutter. Coming out of Live View after shooting at 1/16000sec automatically sees the mechanical shutter reset back to 1/8000sec. Those who regularly use long exposures can set the camera to bulb mode and trigger it with a hard-wired remote controller like the Canon TC80N3 with RA-E3 adapter, or use a wireless remote controller like the BR-E1. Alternatively, users may wish to take advantage of Canon’s Camera Connect app for iOS and Android for free and use it to start/stop the exposure whilst referring to a useful in-built timer. Compared to the Canon EOS 70D and Canon EOS 80D , which have only ever offered the ability to shoot movies at Full HD (1920×1080) resolution, the EOS 90D is the first double-digit EOS DSLR to feature 4K video recording. Most importantly it uses the full width of the sensor with no crop. Videographers can shoot 4K video at 30/25p and Full HD video at up to 120fps. Those who’d like to monitor audio levels will be pleased to read that both headphone and microphone inputs are supported, which are located at the side behind the same rubber flap. This is a decent enough set of specs even today, and pretty unique amongst DSLR designs. Other points of interest include a single card slot at the side that accepts UHS-II SD cards, which seems somewhat mean since many recent rivals have two, and the acceptance of Canon’s high stamina LP-E6N battery. Battery economy has improved too – up from 960 shots on the EOS 80D to 1300 shots based on CIPA testing. This is one respect where the EOS 90D still has a clear advantage over the newer EOS R7. Users who’d like to extend battery life still further can also load two batteries via the BG-E14 ($190 / £174) battery grip, which is the same that the EOS 70D and EOS 80D use. Canon EOS 90D review: Connectivity Wi-Fi connectivity is built into the EOS 90D, offering photographers the freedom to control the camera wirelessly from a smartphone or tablet that’s running Canon’s excellent Camera Connect app . There’s also Bluetooth connectivity to form a permanent connection to a smartphone – a feature previously seen on existing EOS models like the EOS 800D and EOS 77D . It allows your phone to be used as a remote control at any time, without having to mess around setting up a Wi-Fi connection between devices. The Bluetooth connection can also instruct the camera to fire up its Wi-Fi for when you want to copy images across to your phone, or use full remote control with live view. The auto transfer option, which automatically downloads images taken with the camera to a smartphone connected via Wi-fi works well and you’re given the option to select a reduced image size (1620×1080 pixels) to prevent large size files filling your smartphone too quickly. Compared to some cameras, the EOS 90D’s connectivity is straightforward and quick to setup. You get an easy connection guide from the home page of the Camera Connect app that walks you through the steps involved. Canon EOS 90D review: Build & Handling Canon’s double digit DSLR’s have shared much of a likeness for many years. The 70D wasn’t vastly different to the 60D and the 80D, which introduced a slightly enlarged thumb rest, had much the same look as the 70D. Glance at the 90D from the front and you immediately start questioning if any changes have been made at all. On closer inspection you’ll notice the button to raise the pop-up flash protrudes slightly more and there aren’t as many holes for the in-built microphone. Turning our attention to the top plate, the rather plasticky top plate dial has been replaced by one that has a better-knurled texture, but in most other respects it’s identical to the 80D. The buttons to take control of AF mode, drive mode, ISO and metering are all laid out the same, with the small button that’s positioned between the top plate dial and shutter button being well placed to quickly cycle through the AF area modes. In total there are nine custom controls, however the AF area button isn’t one you can reassign to a different function. On the left shoulder of the body you’ll find the mode dial with lock button within to prevent it being moved accidentally. The On/Off switch is positioned below the mode dial again like so many of Canon’s DSLRs. Though it’s not as natural to use as an On/Off switch that encircles the shutter button, you do quickly get used to flicking it with your left thumb. The most significant change to the 90D’s body is found at the rear. After many years of not seeing a multi-controller joystick at the rear of a double-digit EOS DSLR it’s great to see one added again. You may recall that a joystick featured on the EOS 20D, 30D, 40D and 50D, but was then removed from the EOS 60D, 70D and 80D, forcing those who wanted one to look at more advanced EOS models.
        The joystick is positioned where the Quick menu button used to be on the 80D, so this has now been relocated a little lower to the right. The playback button that was positioned above the multi control dial has now been moved below it, which in turn sees the lock switch move across to the right a bit. The purpose of the lock switch is to prevent unintentional changes to exposure compensation and exposure settings by moving the multi control dial. It doesn’t physically lock (the wheel will still turn) but it does turns off the function. Enthusiasts who’d like to intuitively shift the AF point around the frame will really appreciate having the multi-controller joystick on the EOS 90D. Going back to using the 80D and having to tap the directional buttons to get the AF point where you want it to be highlights how much faster and more intuitive focus point positioning is on the 90D. The other benefit of the joystick is that it makes for a great way of quickly navigating the menu. To confirm menu settings, or reposition the AF point back to the centre of the frame, simply push the joystick inwards. The body is constructed from a blend of aluminium alloy and polycarbonate resin with glass fiber. There’s no sign of creaking or squeaking when it’s gripped tightly and though you can tell it’s not as solid as pro-spec EOS models, it feels well put together and robust enough for those it’s designed for. As a camera that’s likely to fall into the hands of countless wildlife, sports and outdoors photographers who might get caught out in wet weather, it was vital for Canon to ensure the body is weather sealed. Canon doesn’t provide any information about exactly how many weather seals feature in the construction, but most importantly they do a good job. Using the 90D outdoors in persistent drizzle for more than two hours caused no harm and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the touchscreen is just as responsive to use when it’s covered in water droplets as when it’s dry, which can’t be said for all cameras. Another thing that’ll appeal is how easy it is for existing Canon users to pick up the 90D and immediately feel at home with it. It won’t feel intimidating for anyone upgrading from an entry-level EOS model and neither does it feel too big a step down from an advanced EOS DSLR like the EOS 7D Mark II . There isn’t a huge difference in weight between the 90D (701g) and 80D (730g), but a saving in weight is better than no saving at all. It’s one of the lightest double-digit EOS DSLRs to be made, second to that of the EOS 30D (700g). Canon EOS 90D review: Viewfinder and Screen The optical viewfinder, like the 80D, offers 100% frame coverage with 0.95x magnification and -3 to +1 m-1 dioptre correction. Exposure variables are clearly displayed along the bottom and if you head into the viewfinder display options in the menu you can choose to display an electronic level, grid display as well as a Flicker detection warning. Unlike many electronic viewfinders found on mirrorless cameras though, it doesn’t rotate this information when you shoot in the portrait format. As for the screen, it’s the same 3in, 1040k-dot vari-angle touchscreen we’ve seen on many Canon DSLRs before. It displays a good, clean feed to assist composition and video recording in Live View. Images are well displayed in playback mode too. Colours are faithful and you get four thumbnail views to quickly search through hundreds of images on the memory card. Having the option of pulling the screen out and tilting it to your preferred angle gives it a distinct advantage over a fixed screen when attempting to shoot from low or high angles. Those with observant eyes will also notice the cut out that helps users pull the screen out when it’s folded back into the camera is now positioned at the top corner rather than at the side. As we’ve become used to on Canon’s most recent DSLRs, the touch screen is very responsive and reacts to the lightest of touches when it’s used to navigate the menus, select different settings or zoom and swipe through images in playback mode. There is the option to increase the sensitivity from standard to sensitive, but it’s hard to decipher a difference between them. If you find the touchscreen more of a hindrance than it is helpful, it can be disabled from the touch control settings. Canon EOS 90D review: Performance The 90D’s layout of 45 autofocus points is grouped quite tightly in the viewfinder. The central gathering of AF points are arranged in a 3×5 grid with the top and bottom line sitting a fraction higher than the two groups of 15 AF points either side. You’re required to press the AF selection button first before you’re able to shift the AF point around the frame. If you’d prefer to move the AF point instantly with the joystick you’ll need to enter the CnFn III Operation/Others option in the menu, head to the Custom Controls and change the function of the Multi-controllers from off to direct AF point selection. I’m quite
        surprised it’s not setup this way as default as I can see many users expecting it to operate this way straight out of the box. In situations where you’d like to focus close to the edge of the frame where there isn’t an AF point you’ll either need to focus and recompose or switch over to shooting in Live View. In the latter you’re provided with much wider 100×88% vertical and horizontal frame coverage with as many as 5481 AF positions to choose from. As well as spot AF, 1-point AF and Zone AF, there’s also tracking AF in Live View, with the option to turn face and eye detection on from a touch of the the Info button. Real-world testing revealed the 90D can identify and track faces effectively, even at long distances. Eye detection becomes active within approximately 2m of a person, with the smaller of two white squares indicating which eye the camera has locked onto. You can tell the camera which eye you’d prefer it to focus on by flicking the joystick left and right, but you will notice that Eye detection becomes less effective when the person you’re photographing turns and isn’t facing the camera straight on. I was particularly impressed by the success rate of sharp shots I managed to achieve in low light when shooting indoor go-karts approaching head-on using the viewfinder. Sports and wildlife users will appreciate the advanced autofocus settings on offer too such as the option to refine the responsiveness of the tracking sensitivity, although being able to choose from various AF case sensitivities for different subjects is a feature that remains exclusive to higher-end EOS models. Reliable metering is another of the 90D’s strengths. You can trust the camera to deliver well-exposed images in evaluative metering mode and I rarely found myself having to dial in more than -1EV to prevent highlights being clipped in the brightest areas. For scenes where evaluative metering isn’t the best option, there’s also partial, spot and centre weighted to choose from. If you happen to underexpose an image a little too far for the highlights, the 90D’s wide dynamic range gives you the scope to pull detail back at the editing stage without introducing unbearable levels of noise. It goes without saying the number of shots that one can get out of the battery pack depends on many different factors, such as the temperature of the environment the camera is used in and how often power-hungry functions like Wi-fi are turned on. Checking the battery info when the battery icon began to blink told me you can get close to the estimated 1300 shots per charge if you use the viewfinder for a majority of your shooting. While this battery life is impressive and surpasses many smaller mirrorless cameras, it’s let down slightly by the fact a newer USB Type-C interface for in-camera charging, like you get on Canon’s EOS R models, isn’t supported. Canon also provides a good amount of control over image processing settings. The default Auto picture style determines what it thinks is the best processing and rendering settings for any given scene and there are seven other picture styles to choose from that can be tweaked to your liking. If you’d like your shots to reflect the scene naturally as you see it with your eyes, faithful or neutral are a great place to start. Hit the Quick menu button in playback mode and you’ll be presented by a number of icons on either side of the screen, processing raw files in-camera and ranking multiple images with a one to five star rating being two such examples. Loading the 90D with a UHS-II card and testing its speed performance resulted in 25 raw files being captured at 10fps using the viewfinder before its buffer was reached. Switching the file format over to Canon’s C-Raw format saw this number rise to 40 frames. Firing off a burst of large JPEGs resulted in 52 images being recorded to our card before the buffer required a breather. For the sport, action and wildlife photographers Canon is aiming the camera at, this buffer performance is a little underwhelming, though we must remember we’re looking at an enthusiast camera here, not a pro-spec model. Ultimately, users will need to judge when to start shooting a burst carefully to ensure the buffer limit isn’t reached partway through an action sequence. Canon EOS 90D review: Image quality The EOS 90D still offers the joint highest resolution of any APS-C camera on the market, alongside the Canon EOS M6 Mark II and EOS R7 , with the move from 24.2-million-pixels to 32.5-million-pixels being quite a jump. Canon has once again opted to overlay the sensor with an optical low-pass filter to help keep moire and false colour artefacts under control. While this does come at the expense of some finer image detail, users will be enthralled by the quality of the 90D’s images when they’re inspected at high magnification. Sports and wildlife photographers will be especially grateful for the increased pixel count when they need to crop tightly. There’s excellent latitude
        when you’d like to return detail too. Raw files let you to pull back a lot of information from deep shadowed regions, which is great for times when you’d like to underexpose for high contrast scenes in order to prevent highlight detail blowing out and being lost. Canon EOS 90D Review: Resolution A close inspection of our resolution chart tells us the EOS 90D’s new sensor resolves a very creditable 3,700l/ph at its base sensitivity of ISO 100. Detail remains high at low sensitivity settings; with resolution figures of 3,600l/ph and 3,400l/ph recorded at ISO 200 and ISO 400 respectively. Push higher into the ISO range and you’ll start to observe fine detail being affected by noise. We recorded 3,100l/ph at ISO 3200 and 2,900l/ph at ISO 6400. The sensor can resolve 2,600l/ph at ISO 12,800 and 2,400l/ph at ISO 25,600 before expansion, with detail dropping right off at ISO 51,000 (2,100l/ph). From the crops below, multiply the number below the lines by 200 to calculate the resolution of lines per picture height. Canon EOS 90D Review: Noise A greater number of pixels on the same sensor surface area risks more noise at pixel level, yet the EOS 90D controls noise well up to ISO 3200 and ISO 6400, putting in a respectable performance. For optimum results you’ll want to shoot in Raw and work between ISO 100 and ISO 400 where you’ll be presented with clean images that are noise free. Luminance noise can be observed at ISO 800 and ISO 1600, but detail isn’t affected too heavily at these settings so you can use them confidently. ISO 3200 is perfectly useable too provided some noise reduction applied during post processing. I’d say this is the upper limit of where I’d want to push to on a regular basis though as fine detail does take more of a hit at ISO 6400 and ISO 8000. Increased noise at ISO 12,800 impinges fine detail and although vibrancy and saturation holds up well at ISO 25,600 and ISO 51,200, both these settings should be avoided. Canon EOS 90D review: Hands-on First Look After accidentally leaking videos revealing details of the company’s soon-to-be-released cameras on its Australian website, Canon has officially announced its latest DSLR in the form of the EOS 90D. Successor to the Canon EOS 80D that hit the market back in February 2016, the new Canon EOS 90D underlines the manufacturer’s strategy of continuing to strengthen its EOS DSLR lineup whilst at the same time expanding and developing the EOS M and EOS R mirrorless range. The Canon EOS 90D, much like its predecessor, is intended to be an attractive proposition for enthusiast photographers well as those who’d like to progress through the EOS line-up from an entry-level triple digit EOS DSLR to a more advanced and sophisticated double-digit model. The Canon EOS 90D has been designed to excel at all genres of photography and video, however Canon sees it being well received by sports and wildlife photographers who demand a camera that can rattle out a continuous burst and resolve excellent detail from a high resolution APS-C sensor. Canon EOS 90D: Features The Canon EOS 90D’s headline upgrade is its increase in resolution. Rather than adopting the 24.2-million pixel CMOS sensor from the Canon EOS 80D, it introduces a new 32.5-million pixel CMOS sensor, which teams up with Canon’s latest DIGIC 8 image processor to provide a slightly wider ISO range of 100-25,600 (expandable to ISO 51,200). This is the first time Canon has used this sensor in a DSLR and it’s identical to the one used in the newly released Canon EOS M6 Mark II. The question sports and wildlife photographers will be wanting to know the answer to is how well this new sensor will cope at high ISO’s – something we look forward to finding out when our review sample arrives next month. The EOS 90D is the third double-digit EOS model to benefit from Dual Pixel CMOS AF – you may recall the Canon EOS 70D was the first model to introduce this game-changing technology back in 2013. The advantage of Dual Pixel CMOS AF is that each microlens covers two photodiodes that can be read independently. By measuring the difference in light that reaches each of the two diodes, the EOS 90D can perform on-sensor phase detection focusing in Live View and whilst recording 4K and Full HD video. Thanks to the new and improved image processor, the EOS 90D is able to shoot a continuous burst faster than before. On the EOS 70D and EOS 80D the maximum shooting speed was 7fps, but this has risen to a healthier 10fps with autofocus tracking when using the viewfinder and 11fps when using Live View with fixed AF. Though it’s good to see the EOS 90D being able to shoot faster than its predecessor, it’s slower than the Canon EOS M6 Mark II, which shoots at up to 14fps, with the option to rattle out a continuous burst at an impressive 30fps using a new Raw Burst mode. Back to the EOS 90D, users get the option to take advantage of Canon’s Eye Detection AF with tracking for stills and movies. Keeping on the subject of autofocus,
        the EOS 90D inherits the same AF system from the EOS 80D for viewfinder shooting. Out of the 45 all cross-type AF points on offer, 27 are f/8 compatible, with the centre point being sensitive down to f/2.8. The working range of the autofocus system remains the same as the EOS 80D and covers -3EV-18EV. Rather than using Canon’s 7,560-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor, the EOS 90D features a new 220k pixel RGB+IR metering sensor. For times when users would like to exceed the maximum 1/8000sec shutter speed of the mechanical shutter there’s the option to shoot up to 1/16000sec by selecting the electronic shutter. Compared to the Canon EOS 70D and Canon EOS 80D, which have only ever offered the ability to shoot movies at Full HD (1920×1080) resolution, the EOS 90D is the first double-digit EOS DSLR to feature 4K video recording. Most importantly it uses the full width of the sensor with no crop. Videographers can shoot 4K video at 30/25p and Full HD video at up to 120fps. Those who’d like to monitor audio levels will be glad to know the EOS 90D features both headphone and microphone inputs at the side of the body for full audio control. As for wireless connectivity, Wi-fi and Bluetooth are both available, offering photographers the freedom to control the camera remotely and wirelessly transmit images from the camera to a mobile device that has Canon’s intuitive Camera Connect app installed. Canon EOS 90D: Build & Handling The size and feel and build quality of the EOS 90D is very similar to that of the EOS 80D. Place the EOS 90D alongside its predecessor and and the only obvious difference from the front is the new model number. Study it a little more closely and you’ll notice the button to raise the pop-up flash protrudes more than it did before and there aren’t as many holes for the in-built microphone. It’s much of the same story on the top plate. Very little has changed here – the AF, drive, ISO and metering buttons are all easily accessible like before and the mode dial has a lock that prevents it being knocked or accidentally changed. Study the top-plate dial that’s controlled with your right hand index finger and you’ll realise it now has a knurled texture that’s less plasticky. The optical viewfinder, again just like the EOS 80D, offers 100% coverage with 0.95x magnification. The screen below it is the same 3in, 1040k-dot vari-angle touchscreen type and there’s now a cutout above the screen rather than at the side to aid pulling it out when it’s folded back into the camera. The biggest change by far on the body is the introduction of a multi-controller joystick. The EOS 90D becomes Canon’s first double-digit DSLR to feature one and it’s positioned where the Quick menu button used to be on the EOS 80D. The Quick menu button has since shifted a little lower to the right and the playback button has moved below the four-way controller that has the rear dial around its perimeter. The beauty of having a multi-controller joystick, just like the ones you’ll find on Canon’s high-end DSLRs, is that it allows you to intuitively reposition the AF point using your thumb without the need to press an AF selection button first. The combination of new multi-controller joystick and the small AF area button on the top plate, which lets you toggle through the different AF area modes, allows users to quickly setup autofocus and refine it faster than before. All we wish for now is for Canon to bring its multi-controller joystick to its full-frame mirrorless EOS R series! Other points of interest include a single card slot at the side that accepts UHS-II SD cards and the acceptance of the same LP-E6N battery as the EOS 80D. Canon told us that the battery life will last for more than 1300 shots, with some photographers who’ve been testing early samples of the camera claiming they can get closer to 1800 shots per charge. Users who’d like to extend battery life have the option of loading two batteries via the BG-E14 battery grip, which is the same as the Canon EOS 80D uses. Canon EOS 90D: First impressions For the amateurs and enthusiasts it’s designed for, the EOS 90D presents some attractive upgrades over the three-year-old Canon EOS 80D. The increase in resolution to 32.5-million-pixels is an interesting move from Canon. It’ll give sports and wildlife photographers better scope when it comes to cropping, but how well it manages to controls noise at high ISO with a greater number of photosites crammed onto the sensor is the question we’re yet to answer. The introduction of 4K video has been long overdue on Canon’s double-digit EOS DSLRs so it’s good to see this making an appearance along with the option to shoot a faster continuous burst at the same speed as the Canon EOS 7D Mark II. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II still has advantages of its own in the way it has a more sophisticated 65-point autofocus system, dual card slots and weather sealing to protect it against dust and moisture. Will Canon replace the EOS 7D Mark II? It’s a
        question we’ve been asking for a while, but now the new 32.5-million-pixel APS-C CMOS sensor has arrived and Canon has showed they’re committed to making DSLRs alongside mirrorless cameras, it’s certainly a possibility. Using the EOS 90D for a few hours at a dark, dingy indoor go-kart track prior to its official launch revealed that it’s a very spritely performer when it comes to focusing. I was left impressed by its ability to pick out people’s eyes at distance through a helmet as well as the speed and precision of focusing in Live View when shooting stills and video. Having a multi-controller joystick under your thumb for making fast, reactive focus point changes is great addition. The vari-angle screen is ideal for getting down low down and shooting from unusual angles. My first impression of the EOS 90D is that it feels well constructed and up to the task to delivering great results in testing conditions. It’s a camera that will receive attention from Canon users who aren’t fussed about switching to mirrorless as well as those who already own a good selection of EF-S or EF lenses. It works out quite a lot more than what you would spend on the previous EOS 80D. Canon has a habit of pitching its new models with a high RRP, but do the improvements really justify spending the extra? Keep an eye out for our upcoming full review to find out.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: With a dearth of new DSLR models over the past few years, it’s been a long time since I last reviewed one (2017, in fact). So shooting with the Canon EOS 850D / Rebel T8i has been an interesting experience. On one level, it’s an impressively refined and capable camera, and if you’re a glass-half-full person, you might conclude that you’re getting the best of both worlds. After all, this is a DSLR that boasts many the best features of a mirrorless camera when it’s switched into live view. The thing is, though, that the EOS 850D / Rebel T8i actually works better in live view in almost every respect. In DSLR mode, it’s let down by its tiny, inaccurate viewfinder; in other words, the one asset that’s supposed to weigh decisively in its favour. So arguably, you’re getting the bulk of a DSLR without its single biggest benefit. You do still get impressive battery life, but it’s really not that hard to buy a spare if you choose a mirrorless camera instead. Ergonomically, the design is also something of a let-down for viewfinder shooting. The rear control dial is too small and fiddly, while AF point selection is slow and awkward. Compared to the beautifully-sorted Fujifilm X-S10, for example, the EOS 850D / T8i simply isn’t as pleasant to use for adjusting creative settings on a shot-by-shot basis. Ironically, it gives better access to a range of functions that you’re unlikely to change as often. Ultimately, the EOS 850D / T8i is about as good as you’ll get from a DSLR at this level, but feels outdated compared to its smaller, slicker mirrorless competitors. Canon has really bitten the bullet, though, and built a series of SLR-style APS-C mirrorless models using its RF lens mount with models to appeal to beginners and enthusiasts. These are so capable and so much more technically advanced than the EOS 850D / T8i, that this camera’s only real advantage now is its access to a large line-up of EF-S lenses.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Canon EOS 850D / T8i now finds itself in the middle of another decisive shift in the marketplace, this time away from the mechanically complex film-era SLR architecture towards the smaller, simpler mirrorless form-factor and electronic, rather than optical viewfinders. But could it be one of the best Canon DSLRs ? In terms of the mirrorless alternatives, it’s up against some fine cameras, including the Nikon Z 50 and the Fujifilm X-S10 , and also from within the Canon camera range itself, notably the EOS R7 , EOS R10 and even the EOS R50 . So how does it measure up against this new-fangled competition? Canon EOS 850D / Rebel T8i: At a glance Canon’s triple-digit DSLR series has a long and distinguished history. Back in 2003, the original EOS 300D was the first sub-£1000 DSLR, a price breakthrough that kick-started the decisive shift by enthusiast photographers from film to digital. The EOS 850D marks the line’s twelfth generation and was originally announced in February 2020, although its appearance in the shops was heavily delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. For more options have a look at the best Canon DSLRs . At $749 / £919 body-only, $899 / £999 with the EF-S 18-55mm f/4-5.6 IS STM kit zoom, or £1299 with the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM lens (UK), the EOS 850D sits between the smaller entry-level EOS 250D / Rebel SL3 and the enthusiast-focused EOS 90D in Canon’s line-up. It is noticeably more expensive in the UK than in the US. It succeeds the EOS 800D from 2017, with the main updates being the addition of face-detection autofocus when using the optical viewfinder, faster continuous shooting, and the addition of 4K video recording (albeit with significant limitations). It also effectively replaced the slightly higher-spec EOS 77D , combining aspects of both cameras. Have a look at our guide to the For more options have a look at the best Canon EF lenses to get an idea of just what is available for these cameras. Canon EOS 850D / T8i: Features Like its predecessor, the EOS 850D is based around a Canon-made 24MP APS-C sensor which offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-25,600, that’s expandable to ISO 51,200 via a custom function. However, it gains a Digic 8 processor, rather than Digic 7, which is responsible for various boosts in performance and brought the EOS 850D closer into line with its mirrorless EOS M50 stablemate. However, this has since been refreshed with the EOS M50 Mark II and then effectively superseded with the RF mount EOS R50, while Canon’s DSLR development appears to have drawn to a close. Nevertheless, this camera employs the 34-year-old EF mount, making it compatible with a vast array of lenses from both Canon and third-party makers such as Tamron and Sigma. But it’s arguably best paired with lenses that are specifically designed for APS-C cameras, including Canon’s EF-S range. Being a DSLR, the EOS 850D is practically two cameras in one. When you shoot using the optical viewfinder, it employs dedicated sensors for metering and autofocus. Press the small button beside the viewfinder to switch it into live view, with a preview shown on the rear screen, and these tasks are taken over by the main image sensor, in exactly the same way as mirrorless cameras work. Five years ago, this would have brought inferior performance, but advances in sensor and processor technology mean that the EOS 850D now offers higher specs in live view, though not at the same level as the latest mirrorless cameras. With the optical viewfinder, the camera employs 45 autofocus points that cover approximately two-thirds of the image width, and one-third of its height. All of these are of the cross type, meaning that they can focus on both horizontally and vertically-oriented detail. This AF system works together with a 220,000-pixel metering sensor, which is capable of detecting faces within the scene and automatically selecting the most appropriate focus point. It also promises improved subject tracking compared to the EOS 800D . Switch into live view and the camera switches to a 143-point autofocus system powered by Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology, which provides phase detection at every sensor pixel for rapid, decisive AF. Again you get face detection and subject tracking options, but the big difference is that this now works across practically the entire frame. Because it’s using a vastly higher resolution sensor, the subject detection also has much more detailed data to work with. Continuous shooting is available at 7 frames per second using the viewfinder, increasing fractionally to 7.5fps in live view. This is impressive for a DSLR at this price, but its mirrorless competitors are even faster. Canon’s own EOS M50 can shoot at 10fps, while the Nikon Z 50 goes one better at 11 fps. While Canon has provided all the core features you’d expect, there’s not a lot in the way of advanced options. There’s an array of scene modes optimised for different subjects, along with an array
        of image-processing filters. You can adjust images in-camera after shooting, with the option of applying a range of presets, or reconverting raw files in-camera. But you won’t find such things as silent shooting, or a built-in intervalometer. Disappointingly, you can’t charge the battery via the micro USB port. These are things we’ve started to take for granted, so it’s a sign of this camera’s age. Turning our attention to video capture, the EOS 850D gains the ability to shoot in 4K at 30fps. But this comes with some serious drawbacks. Firstly, the video is recorded from a central region of the sensor, which imposes a significant 1.6x crop. So to get any sort of wideangle view, you’ll need to acquire an ultra-wide zoom such as Canon’s EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM. Even worse, Dual Pixel CMOS AF is inactivated, leaving the camera reliant on contrast detection alone, which doesn’t work anywhere near as well. On the whole you’re better off sticking to Full HD, which facilitates 60fps shooting without a crop, along with much better phase-detection autofocus. On paper, the EOS 850D / Rebel T8i does offer 4K video, but it can’t match the capabilities of more modern mirrorless alternatives. On a more positive note, Canon has provided excellent smartphone connectivity. Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are built-in, with the latter capable of providing an always-on low-energy connection. This allows you to use your phone as a remote shutter release, simply by firing up the Canon Camera Connect app. Alternatively you can get full control over the camera settings via Wi-Fi, along with live view and the ability to select the focus area by tapping on your phone’s screen. It’s also possible to geotag images using your phone’s GPS while you’re out shooting. When it comes to sharing your images, you can either transfer every image automatically to your phone, or browse through them and selectively copy your favourites across, even when the camera is turned off and stowed away in your bag. It’s all neatly designed and works very well, although Android users may need to tweak the app’s power management settings to prevent the phone from dropping the Bluetooth connection. Canon EOS 850D / T8i: Focal points Canon has built a DSLR that works better in live view than when using the viewfinder Flash: The built-in flash has to be popped up manually. It has a guide number of 12 at ISO100 and works with lenses as wide as 18mm. The hot shoe will take more powerful external units. Battery: Battery life is one area where DSLRs still lead mirrorless models, with the LP-E17 promising 810 shots per charge, dropping to 310 in live view. However it can only be charged externally. Connectors: A 2.5mm port accepts Canon’s RS-60E3 wired remote control, and there’s a 3.5mm stereo mic socket too. Both are placed so as not to block the screen movement. You also get HDMI and Micro USB ports. EF-S lenses: Canon offers a small but well-judged range of affordable, lightweight APS-C lenses that are a good match to the EOS 850D, including a 10-18mm wideangle, 55-250mm telephoto, and 24mm f/2.8 pancake prime. See our guide to the best Canon EF lenses Mode dial: This is notably simplified compared to previous models, with the various subject-optimised scene modes consolidated to a single position. Screen: This can be set to almost any direction, including for high or low angle shooting, or facing forwards for when you want to include yourself in the picture. Canon EOS 850D / T8i: Build and handling By DSLR standards, the EOS 850D / T8i is pretty small and lightweight. However, compared to APS-C mirrorless alternatives such as the Nikon Z 50, Fujifilm X-S10 or Canon’s own EOS M50 Mark II, it’s decidedly bulky; indeed, it’s similar in dimensions to many full-frame mirrorless models. However, this has the advantage of providing space for a large, comfortable handgrip and plenty of external controls, most of which are clustered around the handgrip for easy access. The bulkier design of DSLR cameras like this one is perhaps one reason why they continue to be popular. Like other DSLRs at this price point, the EOS 850D / T8i is primarily constructed with a plastic body shell. But as usual for Canon, it feels nice and robust in your hand. You can’t expect it take a battering like a pro-level camera can – for a start, it’s not weather-sealed – but you shouldn’t have to baby it too much, either. The grip has a textured, rubberised coating with a well-defined space on the back for your thumb. In terms of control layout, the camera is closer to the EOS 77D than the EOS 800D. It sports a small vertical rear dial that’s used to set exposure compensation (or in manual mode, the aperture), along with an AF-ON button for back-button focusing. The other rear controls have been cleaned up compared to its predecessors, with a single Q button above the rear dial instead of the previous cluster of three buttons, which makes it easier to use when holding the camera up to your eye.
        With its rear dial doubling up as a d-pad, compact-camera style, the EOS 850D provides direct external access to almost every major camera setting. There’s a well-placed ISO button behind the front dial, nestling between two other buttons for toggling between AF area grouping modes, and turning the rear LCD on and off. Meanwhile the d-pad gives access to AF, white balance and drive modes, along with image-processing Picture Styles. Unfortunately that rear dial is decidedly small and fiddly, and as I found on some chilly winter days, particularly difficult to operate when you’re wearing gloves. It feels completely out of keeping with the rest of the camera. Canon has provided a small degree of customisation to tweak how the controls work to fit your preferences. For example, it’s possible to disable autofocus activation when you half-press the shutter, leaving it controlled solely via the AF-ON button, which many photographers prefer for shooting moving subjects.  Also, the SET button can be assigned to activate exposure compensation, which can be useful when combining Auto ISO with manual exposure. Beginners get a nicely designed guided user interface that does a reasonable job of explaining the various functions, while more advanced users can switch to Canon’s standard screens and menus, which are quicker to use once you’ve got the hang of them. The rear screen shows a clear and comprehensive status display of the camera’s settings, while a press of the Q button enables you to select and change them. There’s no top-plate status LCD as on the EOS 77D, but I can’t say I missed it. The camera’s biggest operational flaw lies with its slow and clunky method for moving the focus point when you’re shooting with the viewfinder. You first have to press a button on its right shoulder, then use the d-pad or control dials, which requires a lot of thumb movement. This approach worked OK when Canon first introduced multi-point AF in the 1990s with 3 or 5 points, but is much less satisfactory when you have 45 to choose from. Unfortunately, you’re not allowed to repurpose the d-pad to move the AF area directly. What’s more perplexing, though, is that when you enter live view, the camera radically changes how it works. Now, the d-pad is used to move the focus area, which is an odd decision giving that it’s quicker and easier to use the touchscreen. The functions assigned to its buttons are still easily accessed via the Q Menu, but this now looks and works completely differently too. Meanwhile, the AF area selection button engages magnified view. Essentially, this reflects the fact that Canon tacked live view onto its existing DSLR interface back in 2008 and has never really bothered to harmonise the two modes of operation since. Compared to mirrorless cameras that switch between viewfinder and LCD operation seamlessly, it’s a perpetually jarring experience. Canon EOS 850D / T8i: Viewfinder and screen For many photographers, the viewfinder is reason enough to choose a DSLR over a mirrorless model. There is, the argument goes, nothing quite like seeing the world though a large, bright, clear optical viewfinder. This may well be true, but unfortunately the EOS 850D’s pentamirror finder is none of these things. Instead, with just 0.51x magnification and 95% coverage of the image area vertically and horizontally, it’s small, dim and inaccurate. Pentamirrors are a cheaper alternative to traditional pentaprism designs, and visibly inferior. Compared to even the entry-level EOS M50 Mark II’s electronic viewfinder, it’s like peering down a tunnel and trying to make out a distant vista. If you compose your images precisely while shooting, chances are you’ll find extraneous elements creeping into your files that you really wanted to exclude because of the viewfinder’s less-than-100% coverage. You can of course crop these out afterwards to match your original composition as seen in the viewfinder, but it’s a pain and you’ll end up with 21.7MP files. You do at least get a decent amount of settings information, along with the option to display gridlines and a single-axis electronic level. But with no live histogram or exposure preview, you just have to hope for the best with regards to metering, and apply exposure compensation in difficult lighting based on guesswork and experience. Press the depth-of-field preview button on the lens throat, and the finder goes darker still, so you’ll be hard pressed to visualise what it’s meant to be showing. Switch into live view, and the viewing experience is transformed. The rear LCD gives a 100% accurate preview of your composition, while also reflecting the current exposure and colour settings. You can judge exposure compensation based on both the preview image and a live histogram, which can be set to display in RGB as well as brightness. When you press the depth-of-field preview button you can also see what’s actually going on with regards to front-to-back sharpness. It’s a much better means
        of composing your images. Another advantage of using live view is that the fully-articulated screen allows you to shoot at high or low angles in both portrait and landscape formats. All of the camera settings can be changed using Canon’s superb touch interface, which is quick and intuitive to use. The touchscreen is superbly responsive, and its sensitivity can be boosted for use with gloves. Canon EOS 850D / T8i: Autofocus Arguably, the EOS 850D’s split personality becomes most acute when it comes to autofocus. Canon has clearly designed the viewfinder and live view systems to look as similar to each other as possible, but in practical use, they behave quite differently. Crucially, in live view the camera can focus on subjects almost anywhere within the frame, while being able to track them more accurately, too. In other words, it works better when it’s pretending to be mirrorless. In some ways, this Canon DSLR perfectly demonstrates the advantages of mirrorless. In both viewing modes, Canon has provided a superficially similar set of four focus-area selection options, which are toggled through using a button in front of the mode dial. You can also choose between one-shot AF for static subjects, and servo for those that move. A third AI Focus option auto-switches between these when it detects subject movement, but it’s only available when using the viewfinder. Another oddity is that the viewfinder and live view AF settings are treated independently, so if you change them for one viewing mode, this won’t be reflected when you switch to the other. When using the viewfinder, you can select between single point, 9-point zone, 15-point large zone and auto area selection modes. In the zone modes the camera’s 45-point AF is effectively divided up into three blocks of 15, left, centre and right, and your selected AF zone can’t straddle these blocks. This limits further the flexibility with which you can position the focus zone. If you shoot portraits using auto area mode, the camera will choose the focus points that cover your subject’s face, but won’t specifically pick out their eyes in the way more sophisticated systems will. Switch to live view, and you now get spot, 1-point, zone, and face detection/tracking modes. In effect the first three provide different sizes of AF area, which you can position freely around the frame, aside from at the extreme edges. The tracking mode also covers the same wide area and is very much better at identifying and sticking to your subject. Unsurprisingly, though, it’s not as ludicrously capable as the AI-based system Canon has included in its much more expensive EOS R6 and EOS R6 Mark II, which are capable of focusing specifically on the eyes of animals and birds. If you stick to using relatively small-aperture zooms, then you shouldn’t have too many autofocus problems in either mode. The camera focuses quickly and decisively, and continues to work well in dim indoor lighting.  However if you use a fast prime such as a 50mm f/1.8, then the AF is liable to be slightly off when you’re using the optical viewfinder, particularly if you choose an off-centre focus point. In contrast, the on-sensor AF that’s used in live view is consistently more accurate. Canon EOS 850D / T8i: Performance As you’d expect from the twelfth generation of its line, the EOS 850D / Rebel T8i is for the most part a refined, reliable camera. It fires up almost instantly when you flick the power switch, and responds instantly to all of the controls. I’d turn off image review after shooting, though, as it inflicts an annoying interruption on live view shooting. Both metering and auto white balance are generally reliable, which means that the camera mostly delivers well-exposed images without any troublesome colour casts. Canon’s JPEG colour is as excellent as always, being punchy and saturated but not overblown, while the firm’s Auto Lighting Optimiser (ALO) does a fine job of balancing light and dark areas of the image more naturally. When you’re shooting with the viewfinder in bright daylight, the metering can be a little prone to blowing out detail in bright highlights, so it can be wise to apply some pre-emptive exposure compensation. At low ISOs you can easily lift two or three stops of shadow detail in raw processing without noise being a problem, so it pays to bias your exposure to protect highlight detail. However when you switch to live view, the camera performs just that bit better, with barely any exposure missteps at all. Continuous shooting is impressive, with the camera meeting its specified speed in my tests. Its buffer is very creditable, too; I was able to shoot 37 frames in raw + JPEG mode before the camera slowed down, which increased to about 60 using the space-saving CRAW format. Switch to recording JPEGs only, and the camera will happily fire off a couple of hundred files in a row at full speed. The only caveat is that you have to wait while your images are written to card before you
        can change secondary settings, so it pays to buy a fast SD card if you expect to shoot a lot of bursts. For sports and action shooting, in practice the camera is likely to be limited more by its ability to maintain focus. Canon EOS 850D / T8i: ISO and Noise We’ve seen this sensor and processor combination in previous Canon models, including the mirrorless EOS M50, and it brings no great surprises here. It delivers fine image quality at low ISO settings, with strong, attractive colour and plenty of fine detail. Noise starts to become visible at ISO 800 when examining image files up-close, but it’s only at ISO 3200 that it starts to have any obvious impact on fine detail. But I’d still be perfectly happy using this setting as a matter of course. There’s a visible drop-off in quality at ISO 6400, though, and while ISO 12,800 is perfectly usable for smaller reproduction sizes, it’s probably as high as you’d usually want to go. By ISO 25,600 both colour and detail have deteriorated dramatically, while ISO 51,200 is barely usable. Below are 100% crops of our standard test scene, taken from raw files processed using  Adobe Camera Raw.'

      value: The Canon EOS 7D Mark II adds some class-leading specification to its already popular camera. The 20.2-million-pixel sensor gives improved image quality compared to the 7D, with better performance at high ISO settings, although we’d probably avoid using settings north of ISO 6400. However at low ISOs it can’t match the ability to recover shadow detail that we see from many of its competitors. My main gripes about the camera concern what’s been left out. There is no touchscreen, no articulation of the LCD and no Wi-Fi connectivity, which is disappointing. However, for the target audience of the wildlife and sports photographer, these features may not be a priority. Where it truly excels is in its build, handling and autofocusing system. The body is solid, it feels good in the hand and the button placement makes sense. The new addition of the thumb lever coupled with the additional viewfinder information displays makes settings easy to change without even needing to take the eye from the camera. The new 65-point autofocus system is fantastic, locking on and tracking subjects very quickly, even in challenging conditions. It’s great to see a professional-grade autofocusing system inside an enthusiast camera. Likewise, the ability to shoot at 10 frames per seconds, with a very respectable buffer, was once the preserve of only top-end SLRs costing thousands of pounds. The addition of Canon’s Dual Pixel AF provides improved autofocus in video, too. In all, Canon has made a very capable action camera for the enthusiast photographer. Its original new body price was £1,600 so it was one of the most expensive APS-C cameras on the market at the time, but it was also one of the best, which makes it worth picking up as a second-hand bargain. Its used body price is around $467-580 or £265-469. Given the outdoor nature of its owners, the best advice is to invest in a better condition sample that has seen less action.

      value: 'The Canon EOS 7D Mark II is Canon’s high-speed 20MP APS-C DSLR, with 10fps continuous shooting, 65 AF points, weather-sealed, dual memory card slots, and FullHD 60p video recording. If you’re looking for a tough and high-speed Canon DSLR could this be the best Canon DSLR for you? Find out in our full review. Canon EOS 7D Mark II – At a Glance The EOS 7D series offered features that wouldn’t look out of place on Canon’s family of pro-level EOS-1 DSLRs including rapid continuous shooting and advanced AF. The EOS 7D Mark II could rattle through frames at 10fps at its full 20.2MP resolution and it employed a really responsive 65-point, all cross-type sensor AF system, making it a sought after machine among action shooters. In addition, as an APS-C format camera, action and nature shooters appreciated the benefit of the 1.6x crop factor, where a 300mm focal length lens gave the equivalent view of a 480mm lens. Bundling all this together into a durable, weather-sealed body makes a very exciting prospect for any enthusiast action photographer who cannot justify the expense of sports and wildlife monsters such as the Nikon D4S or the Canon EOS-1D X . Canon EOS 7D Mark II Review – Features The Canon EOS 7D Mark II features a 20.2-million-pixel CMOS sensor, which Canon describes as new but is probably closely related to the sensor in the EOS 70D . It’s an APS-C-sized unit with a 1.6x focal length magnification, meaning a 100mm lens will act as a 160mm equivalent. For users who rely upon long focal length lenses this is a big advantage, as it gives more reach. The improvement to continuous shooting further increases the camera’s appeal to wildlife and sports photographers. As well as increasing the frames per second from the 8fps of the 7D to 10fps, the 7D Mark II has a huge buffer. Providing the card is fast enough, the camera can shoot full-resolution JPEG images until the card is full, and it’s also possible to shoot and write a burst of 31 raw images in one go. Two separate DIGIC 6 processors work together to deliver this very impressive performance. In addition to the speed increase, they should also improve the in-camera JPEG image processing. An impressive leap forward has been made when it comes to the ISO sensitivity range. The 7D had a rather limited native range of ISO 100-6400 (extended to ISO 12,800), while the 7D Mark II has an ISO sensitivity of 100-16,000, with two extended options of ISO 25600 (H1) and ISO 51,200 (H2). It’s surprising that there is no Wi-Fi connectivity included on the 7D Mark II. However, it is compatible with Eye-Fi SD cards, which can easily transfer files wirelessly to a mobile device. On the top of the camera, in front of the hotshoe, is a small GPS module. This can record the latitude and longitude of where an image was taken, along with the direction in which the camera was pointing. There is also an option to track the photographer’s location even if they’re not shooting. Both functions can be disabled. Canon says the 7D Mark II is likely to be bought not only by photographers looking to upgrade from an entry-level camera, but also existing 7D and pro-level camera owners. For this reason, two card slots, for SD and Compact Flash, have been included. Full HD 1920 x 1080-resolution video can be recorded at up to 60fps in NTSC and 50fps in PAL. There are also options for 30fps, 25fps and 24fps. Using the HDMI port, it’s possible to output uncompressed (4:2:2) video to an external recorder. One useful feature is an improved bulb mode. Instead of needing a cable release to shoot exposures longer than 30secs, you can now specify a time in the menu. Canon EOS 7D Mark II Review – Build and Handling The type of photographer who will use the 7D Mark II is likely to subject it to pretty challenging conditions. It’s reassuring, then, to see that Canon has not scrimped on the build quality. The camera body is made of durable magnesium alloy, and weather sealing has been improved over its predecessor, making the 7D Mark II the second-best weather-sealed DSLR in Canon’s line-up behind the flagship EOS-1D X . During my test of the 7D Mark II I subjected it to some brutal weather conditions that gave it a thorough soaking, and it came through without damage. I can confirm first-hand that you can take the camera out in the rain with nothing to fear! The 7D Mark II’s body shape is almost identical to that of the 7D, but the button layout is much more like the EOS 5D Mark III. The Q menu has been moved to the right side of the LCD, and other buttons have been shifted around to accommodate a rate button. This is particularly useful for highlighting the best shots from a burst sequence. The rear dial gains inset touch buttons for changing settings silently during video recording. Also, Canon has opted for a locking mode dial, to help prevent accidental changes. Making its debut on this camera is a thumb-operated sprung lever, which is centred around the joystick on the rear of the camera.
        This can be assigned to carry out multiple functions. I found setting it up to toggle through AF area selection options was great when shooting with a long lens. However, when I wasn’t shooting in this way, I assigned the lever to be pulled down to give me the option of using the front dial to change ISO sensitivities. It’s one of the most useful functions I’ve seen on a camera. Without taking my eye from the viewfinder, everything was available for me. Tapping the Q button brings up the quick menu on the LCD screen. From here, there are numerous custom controls and button reassignment options. As standard, the 7D Mark II comes with a new, longer-lasting LP-E6N battery, although it will still work with older LP-E6 batteries. LCD/viewfinder The 7D Mark II’s TFT Clear View II LCD has an ample 1.04-million-dot resolution. It’s very easy to see and has accurate colour rendition, but I’m disappointed by the omission of both touch sensitivity and LCD articulation. These are both really useful on the EOS 70D, especially for video work. A transmissive LCD panel is located above the focusing screen, which allows information to be visible through the viewfinder. This can be turned on/off or set up to suit the photographer’s needs. I found the dual-axis electronic level to be very useful. Gridlines are available to aid with composition, and various settings, such as focus, drive and metering modes, can be displayed in the viewfinder too. Canon EOS 7D Mark II Review – Performance Autofocus Where the 7D Mark II shows the most dramatic improvements is in autofocusing, with a remarkable 65 focus points covering a large portion of the frame. What’s more, all are cross-type, so they can focus on both horizontal and vertical detail. The centre point even focuses at -3EV, which is essentially moonlight. The centre point is sensitive to f/2.8, which improves accuracy with fast lenses. Also, for the first time, it works down to f/8. This means it’s possible to use a telephoto lens with a teleconverter and still have autofocus, providing the effective maximum aperture is f/8 or larger. Advanced iTR AF tracking uses image information provided by Canon’s new 150,000-pixel metering sensor to track subjects across a frame. Like the EOS-1D X and the EOS 5D Mark III , the 7D Mark II has an advanced focusing menu that allows users to configure the AF system for what type of subject they’re shooting. In use, I found the continuous focusing worked very well, and the different settings do help to achieve better results. My first outing with the camera was to shoot an event in the Lightbox club in London. The lighting conditions presented a real challenge for any autofocusing system, but the 7D Mark II performed brilliantly. Using all 65 points, the camera quickly found the right point of focus and the hit rate of sharp shots was very high. When shooting deer in dense woodland, I opted to shoot with a small cluster of AF points and move it across the frame using the joystick control on the rear of the camera. It made focusing very fast in operation and I got the shots I wanted without fault. Like the 70D, the 7D Mark II has Dual Pixel CMOS AF, which provides better focusing in video. One improvement over the 70D, though, is its ability to change the AF drive speed for smoother focus pulls. However, the focusing in live view still isn’t as fast or decisive as using the viewfinder. Metering A new 150,000-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor provides four options for metering, partial, spot, evaluative and centreweighted average. All these settings give accurate results, striking a good balance between shadow and highlight detail. Evaluative metering is linked to all 65 AF points and I found there were no issues with inaccurate metering when this setting was used in the right situation. For most of my shooting, I rarely needed to switch metering from that setting. See more images taken with the Canon EOS 7D Mark II in our sample image gallery Canon EOS 7D Mark II Review – Image Quality The Canon EOS 7D Mark II performs commendably in our Applied Imaging tests, giving good resolution for its 20.2-million-pixel sensor and low noise at ISO 100-1600. As you’d expect, image quality deteriorates at higher sensitivities, but the JPEG output is still pretty good at ISO 6400, although with obvious loss of shadow detail. ISO 12,800 loses most fine detail, and the top settings are best used only when there’s no alternative. Processed raw images give similar results, delivering usable results up to about ISO 6400. As usual, though, the highest ISOs settings are very noisy indeed, and should really only be used when absolutely necessary. The 7D Mark II performs well with regards to dynamic range, and like other Canon SLRs its highlight tone priority setting can be used to help make the most of this, by expanding the range of tones recorded in the highlights by 1 stop, before they clip to white. The default colour rendition is perfectly attractive, and Canon
        offers a range of picture styles for different subjects. These can be adjusted in-camera, and can even be adjusted by the user to suit their personal preferences. Our camera graphs explained Resolution The EOS 7D Mark II resolved around 3000l/ph at ISO 100, with smooth blurring of lines beyond this point and no problems with aliasing or false colour. This holds up to ISO 800, beyond which resolution gradually decreases due to the effects of noise and noise reduction. A reading of 2800l/ph is maintained up to about ISO 3200, and 2600 l/ph to ISO 12,800, but this drops dramatically at the top two settings, to 2000l/ph at ISO 51,200. Dynamic range Base ISO DR is a pretty impressive 12.7EV, according to our Applied Imaging tests. But in real-world use the sensor doesn’t perform quite as well as these numbers suggest, giving more noise in the shadows at low ISOs than its rivals. The DR initially drops quite gradually as the sensitivity is increased, and the 7D Mark II maintains a creditable performance up to about ISO 1600. Beyond this it falls off more rapidly, with a value of 8.6EV at ISO 6400, and the top two settings give distinctly poor results. Colour This 3D graph compares the colour shift from the reference colour to the photographed chart: the higher the peak, the greater the shift from the original. In the default JPEG colour setting, Canon offers a moderately contrasty and saturated rendition, with some emphasis on the blues, and to a lesser extent the reds. In real-world shooting, skin tones in portraits are rendered very well and appear rich and well saturated. There were pleasing, punchy and vibrant colours to be seen in the autumnal leaves in the forest, too. Noise The images above have a resolution of 300ppi, reflecting a high-resolution print. The 7D Mark II gives clean, detailed images at low ISOs, with a hint of luminance noise creeping in at ISO 1600. Shadow detail starts to deteriorate noticeably at ISO3200, and most fine low contrast detail is being lost to noise reduction by ISO 12,800.The top two settings give very murky files, particularly in the darker tones, and are best kept for emergencies only. Adobe Camera Raw wasn’t capable of reading the EOS 7D Mark II’s raw files, so we examined them using the Digital Photo Pro software supplied with the camera. This gives broadly similar images to the in-camera JPEG processing, with very usable results up to ISO 3200 and only seriously deteriorating at ISO 12800. Again ISOs 25,600 and 51,200 really aren’t great. The grey-card images above are JPEG files shot with the 7D Mark II’s default noise reduction and colour settings applied. The images are printed at 300ppi to reflect the noise that would be experienced in a high-resolution print. The 7D Mark II delivers clean images at low ISOs, and luminance noise only starts to become visible at ISO 800. This increases monotonously as the sensitivity is increased, but in these shots it doesn’t really show very much until the top two settings are reached. Raw files processed using Digital Photo Pro tell a similar story, being usable to ISO 6400 at least. Canon EOS 7D Mark II Review – First Look The Canon EOS 7D’s reign as the flagship in Canon’s APS-C DSLR lineup finally comes to an end as the firm announces its successor: the Canon EOS 7D Mark II. With this new release, Canon seems to be placing the emphasis very much on speed and accuracy. The 7D Mark II boasts two DIGIC 6 image processors, which allows it to shoot at up to 10fps without making any sacrifices in resolution. The rest of the camera is able to keep up with this improved speed too – we haven’t yet been able to test the write speeds of the Canon EOS 7D Mark II, but Canon claims it will be able to shoot 31 Raw files at 10fps before hitting the buffer, and that it’ll be able to shoot JPEGs indefinitely (or at least until your card fills up). The 7D Mark II receives a boost in resolution over its predecessor – unsurprising given the five-year gap between them. Its APS-C CMOS sensor boasts a pixel count of 20.2MP – identical to that of the EOS 70D. It also comes sporting a viewfinder with 100% coverage of the frame, which can overlay additional shooting info such as white balance if the user desires, and features a levelling guide for straight shots. A new 150,000-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor has also been added for even more accurate exposures. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II is capable of recording movies in M in Full HD (1920 x 1080), with a choice of frame rates from 24p to 60p, and features a dedicated stereo mic input. It uses Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology for video focusing, borrowed from the EOS 70D Autofocus High burst speed needs top-notch autofocus to complement it, and it appears that Canon has outdone itself with the 7D Mark II’s new 65-point AF system. Whereas previous Canon AF systems have featured 19 cross-type AF points, in the EOS 7D Mk II every single one of these AF points is cross-type. The centre point offers dual cross-type
        focusing at f/2.8. The autofocus system on the EOS 7D Mark II pulls in a fair few features from other Canon DSLRs. It inherits the latest generation off AI Servo II from the EOS 1DX, and improves on the acceleration and deceleration tracking of moving subjects. It also borrows the six autofocus ‘case studies’ – AF settings that correspond to specific situations – from the EOS 1DX and EOS 5D Mk III. A new AF selection lever allows the user to switch between AF modes without moving away from the viewfinder – a welcome addition that should make shooting a good deal more fluid. Design and Build Design-wise, Canon hasn’t made great strides on the original EOS 7D. The 7D Mark II looks and feels very similar to its predecessor. However, there are a few refinements in the physical design that are worth looking at. New to the 7D Mark II is weather sealing, which Canon says is second-best to the EOS 1DX. The dimensions have also been altered slightly from the 7D, allowing the 7D Mark II to accept a new BG E-16 battery grip. While it’s nice to see a built-in interval timer and dual card slots – one SD, one CompactFlash – it is a bit of a shame that we aren’t seeing a touchscreen on the 7D Mark II. A vari-angle screen would have been nice too, rather than the fixed version we’ve ended up with. More surprising though is the lack of built-in Wi-fi functionality. Seeing a DSLR released without Wi-fi in 2014 is, to be honest, rather odd, and while the EOS 7D Mark II can be used with the WFT-E7 wireless file transmitter, this involves incurring an additional expense of a whopping £599. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II is expected in the early weeks of November, priced £1599 body-only.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: It was always going to be a challenge to replace the EOS 5D Mark II. Thankfully, Canon has been sensible with its upgrade, choosing to focus on improving its weaker areas. So, while the resolution is largely unchanged in the 5D Mark III, the sensor’s low-light and high-sensitivity performance is markedly better. However, for me, the greatest improvement is to the camera’s AF system. The 5D Mark III focuses faster than its predecessor and has all the advanced settings one would expect from Canon’s EOS-1D professional series of DSLRs. What these two major new features mean is that the appeal of the 5D Mark III may stretch to an even greater range of photographers than the Mark II. However, those more interested in video may be left wanting a little more. Overall, it is difficult to fault the 5D Mark III, given its target audience and price. I have no doubt it will be a popular and successful camera; the only question may be whether existing 5D Mark II users will feel the changes warrant an upgrade – or whether those looking for their first full-frame DSLR will be lured in by the Nikon D800’s higher resolution instead. Canon EOS 5D Mark III – key points Rather than separate magnify and shrink buttons, the EOS 5D Mark III uses this single button held down, while the control dial is used to zoom in and out. The silent shooting feature will be particularly useful for event photographers. It slows the mirror’s movements so that it doesn’t slap, the point being to reduce the sound it makes when an image is taken. It works well, although the shooting rate is reduced and the viewfinder is blacked out for a little longer. However, this shouldn’t be an issue if you are shooting a quiet, and presumably slow-moving, event. When in playback mode, there is the option to convert raw files to JPEGs. Brightness, white balance, picture style, auto light optimiser, colour space, noise reduction, image size, vignetting, lens distortion and chromatic aberration can all be adjusted before a JPEG file is created. As the EOS 5D Mark III is considered one of Canon’s professional-level cameras, it does not have a built-in, pop-up flash. Instead, the camera has a hotshoe and is compatible with the Canon range of Speedlite flashguns. By pressing the image style button on the rear of the camera, it is possible to select multiple exposure and HDR mode. The latter creates an HDR image in-camera, with the ability to choose from a selection of HDR styles and bracketing options. Images can also be aligned, so provided you are reasonably steady it may not be necessary to use a tripod. This switch activates live view and video capture, with the button used to start and stop recording Canon has reduced the reflectivity of the new 3.2in screen The Competition The Canon EOS 5D Mark III’s main competitor is the Nikon D800. With a similar sized body but a higher 36.1-million-pixel resolution, the D800 would seem to have something of an advantage, although its shooting rate does not quite match that of the EOS 5D Mark III. We will have a full test of the D800 next week (AP 28 April). With no dramatic improvement in resolution between the EOS 5D Mark II and Mark III, the occasional fair-weather photographer who is not interested in the improved low-light performance, faster AF and shooting rate may opt to take advantage of the excellent price of the 5D Mark II. With a street price of around £1,700, the older camera is a relative bargain. What’s more, with dedicated photographers also upgrading, it may soon be possible to buy a used 5D Mark II at an even more affordable price.

      value: 'The Canon EOS 5D Mark III offers a full-frame 22.3MP sensor, 61 AF points, 6fps continuous shooting, and FullHD video recording. It’s now available for bargain prices second-hand, but does this make it one the best Canon DSLRs for those on budget? Find out in our review. The Canon EOS 5D series appealed to discerning enthusiast and professional photographers from the very beginning but its popularity really took off with the arrival of the Canon EOS 5D Mark II and its ground-breaking video skills. It was voted by AP readers in early 2012 as The Greatest Camera of All Time and without doubt it set new standards especially for its Full HD video skills. A few years after its launch, the EOS 5D Mark II was starting to look dated, especially its limited nine zone AF system, and in the spring of 2012, Canon introduced the EOS 5D Mark III. With its headline features of a 22MP full-frame sensor, 61-point AF system, 6fps continuous shooting and enhanced video skills, the EOS 5D Mark III soon had hordes of Mark II owners upgrading to it as well as attracting many new fans. Over the EOS 5D Mark III’s working life it benefitted from a series of firmware updates to improve its skills and Version 1.3.6 was the last in September 2019. Even now, the rugged and solidly built EOS 5D Mark III appeals as a highly capable DSLR and it is available in the pre-owned second-hand market at around $628-829 or £369-620 for the body only. Shop around for a good condition model and it should give reliable service for years to come. Canon EOS 5D Mark III Features With Sony offering a 24.3-million-pixel, APS-C-sized sensor in its Alpha 77 , and Nikon’s D800 boasting a 36.1-million-pixel, full-frame unit, it may seem a little strange that the resolution of the EOS 5D Mark III has only been increased 1.2 million pixels from its predecessor. Canon clearly believes that this level of resolution is perfectly adequate for enthusiast and professional photographers, and has instead worked to produce a more efficient sensor. One way in which Canon has done this is through the use of the same gapless microlens technology found in the EOS-1D X . Microlenses focus the light that reaches a camera’s imaging sensor into the photodiodes. If there are no gaps between the lenses, far more light will reach the photodiodes and be converted to an electrical signal. Even small increases in the amount of light reaching the photodiodes can improve dynamic range in shadow areas, effectively improving the camera’s performance in low-light conditions. This also helps to cut down on image noise. The sensor has been further improved by adding a noise-reduction circuit in the image sensor. This circuit should help even before the raw data is produced, at which point noise is further reduced. The camera’s sensitivity of ISO 100-25,600 is expandable to ISO 50-102,400. This is a 2EV increase at the top end of the camera sensitivity spectrum compared to the ISO 50-25,600 expanded sensitivity range of the EOS 5D Mark II. The increased sensitivity range is down to a 14-bit Canon Digic 5+ processor, which is responsible for controlling all the 5D Mark III’s circuitry. Combined with the fast DDR-SDRAM memory, the camera is able to shoot at 6fps, which is 2.1fps faster than the 5D Mark II. When using a UDMA 7-compatible CompactFlash card, the memory buffer allows up to 18 raw images to be shot in a single burst, or up to 16,000 JPEGs. A second memory card socket for SD cards is also present on the 5D Mark III (although not on its predecessor), and this allows video footage to be saved to one space and stills to another. Two of the other major new features have already been mentioned: one is the 63-zone metering system, which is also used in the EOS 7D; and the other is by far the biggest improvement – a completely overhauled AF system (more about this later). 61-Point AF System Features In Use: 61-Point AF System By using the same AF system in the EOS 5D Mark III as that used in the EOS-1D X, it is the first time that Canon has used its top-of-the-range AF system in any DSLR outside its EOS-1 series. With a shooting rate of a respectable 6fps and a fast and accurate 61-point AF system, the 5D Mark III is a huge upgrade on the simple nine-point AF system and 3.9fps of the 5D Mark II. As a result, the new camera will find itself being used much more for action images than its predecessor is. Of the 61 AF points, an impressive 41 are of the more sensitive cross type, with five of these being double cross type. This is as impressive an AF array as can be found in any DSLR. So customisable is the AF system of the 5D Mark III that it requires its own menu, with five sub-menu screens that allow up to 15 different features to be set. Thankfully, there are six default settings, called such things as ‘versatile multi-purpose setting’ and ‘instantly focus for subjects suddenly entering AF points’. Pressing the info button provides help about when to use each default setting.
        Should you wish to tweak the default modes, then the tracking sensitivity, acceleration/deceleration tracking and AF point auto switching settings can all be adjusted. Again, the info button can be used to get advice on each adjustment. Placing the AF settings openly rather than tucking them away in custom menus, and having a useful selection of presets and a help screen, make the AF system far more transparent. This should in turn enable photographers to tweak the settings to their own particular requirements much more easily. Overall, the AF system is a marked improvement over that found in the 5D Mark II and one that many Canon users will appreciate. It certainly raises the 5D range to a level at which it will be considered by more professional photographers. Sports photographers and photojournalists should find the AF system, combined with the camera’s resolution, a very useful tool. Canon EOS 5D Mark III Build and Handling The body of the EOS 5D Mark III is made of magnesium alloy, and is around the same size and as reassuringly sturdy as its predecessor. Like the 5D Mark II, the camera is comfortable to hold, with a  but well-contoured handgrip and a groove in which the forefinger rests while using the shutter button. One aspect of the body that has been improved is the weather sealing, which should help to protect internal components from splashes, sand and dust. Those familiar with enthusiast and professional Canon EOS DSLRs will be able to pick up the 5D Mark III and use it instantly. As stated, much of the layout is derived from the EOS 7D, including the location of the power switch behind the mode dial on the top plate, a lock on the rear control dial to prevent accidental use, and a dedicated switch to shift between live view and video capture. The mode dial can also be locked to prevent any accidental switching of modes. Some new buttons are present on the back of the camera next to the LCD screen. One of these allows quick access to colour and contrast image settings, including picture styles, in-camera HDR and multiple exposure mode. However, when in playback mode it also provides a side-by-side image view. This enables two pictures to be compared, and magnified if required, for more accurate assessment of detail and focus. There is also the option to compare the histograms of the two images to check for burnt-out highlights or black shadow areas. It is a lovely touch, and will no doubt be very useful for photographers wanting to make sure they have captured the best possible shot. The Rate button is another handy editing tool. Pressing it in playback allows individual images to be rated out of five stars. This feature was previously seen in the Canon EOS 60D, and any star rating applied to a photo is saved in the image file and can then be used by editing and library software, such as Adobe Bridge, Lightroom or Aperture, to help organise images. Metering It is hard to fault the 63-segment metering system of the EOS 5D Mark III. This is the same system as used in the EOS 7D , which is a significant upgrade from the 35-zone metering system of the EOS 5D Mark II. I got up early to photograph the morning light over the coast and was impressed with how the evaluative metering system of the 5D Mark III coped. Exposures are generally spot on. I rarely used the exposure compensation control, and when I did it was in the kind of situations to be expected, such as when shooting directly into sunlight. On a couple of occasions I did reduce the exposure by 0.3EV, just to make sure that highlight detail was retained, and to help make blue skies look even more vivid. Indoors, and under artificial light, the performance of the 5D Mark III’s metering was what I can only describe as realistic, with images as bright as the scene being portrayed. Although this was technically accurate, I did find myself increasing the exposure of some images by up to +1.3EV in order to lighten shadow areas and add punch. However, this was of no real concern, being easy to correct using exposure compensation. Evaluative metering is also linked to the AF point in use, so it is worth remembering this, particularly if you are in the habit of focusing and recomposing. Interestingly, spot metering is only linked to the central 1.5% of the viewfinder, not to the AF point in use. Partial metering, which takes up 7.2% of the frame, and centreweighted average are also available. Dynamic Range The dynamic range of the EOS 5D Mark III is generally good, with the camera doing a fine job of making sure there is highlight detail. Of course, this sometimes leaves shadows slightly underexposed, although enough detail can be recovered without introducing noise, particularly at lower sensitivities. Photographers who capture images as raw files have far more scope for recovering highlight and shadow detail in raw-conversion software. However, those shooting JPEG images may want to take advantage of the 5D Mark III’s highlight tone priority
        mode. This seems to work by underexposing images to retain more highlight detail, and then boosting the shadows and midtones to compensate for the underexposure. I found that the reduction in exposure was usually as little as 0.3EV, which is enough to recover some finer highlight details while only requiring a slight boost to shadows. This means that noise in these darker areas doesn’t become much more of an issue. Once again, though, to minimise the effect of noise, I would recommend using the highlight priority tone only on sensitivities below ISO 400. Canon EOS 5D Mark III Noise Resolution and Sensitivity With a 22.1-million-pixel sensor, the detail resolution of the EOS 5D Mark III is very good, with JPEG images just about reaching 30 on our test chart, and slightly more detail being resolved when raw images have been adjusted. This is almost exactly the same as the detail resolved by the 5D Mark II. Noise is well controlled within the standard sensitivity range. There are signs of noise at ISO 800, but it is only when ISO 6400 is reached that luminance noise really becomes visible, particularly in dark midtones and shadows. Images created at these sensitivities are still usable, though, particularly as colour noise is easily removed using raw-conversion software. At ISO 25,600, JPEGs show both luminance and colour noise, worsening at extended sensitivities. As usual, these settings should only be used when there is no other option – they are extended settings for a reason. While the AF and shooting rate are much improved over the 5D Mark II, the 5D Mark III is still very much aimed at studio, landscape, travel and street photographers. As such, there will rarely be the need to shoot much higher than ISO 1600, so the noise at higher sensitivities shouldn’t be an issue. Autofocus With a 61-point AF system borrowed from Canon EOS-1D X, you would expect the 5D Mark III to focus quickly and accurately, and it doesn’t disappoint. In good light, the AF is extremely fast and responsive, and those thinking of buying the 5D Mark III for documentary photography will be more than happy. In low light the 5D Mark III’s focus also performs well, although without being able to make a direct comparison I didn’t think it was quite as good as that of the Nikon D4 . We hope to be able to test the two AF systems side by side when we compare the Canon EOS-1D X against the Nikon D4 in the coming months. Viewfinder, LCD, Live View and Video As you would expect for a camera of its price, the viewfinder of the EOS 5D Mark III is bright, clear and offers 100% coverage, improving upon the 98% coverage offered by the 5D Mark II. The size and resolution of the LCD screen have also been increased slightly to 3.2in and 1.04 million dots respectively. Although the screen is only 0.2in larger than that of the 5D Mark II, the fractionally greater space allows the 3:2 ratio images created by the camera to take up the entire screen. Previously, there was a black bar at the top and bottom of the image. This minor increase makes the image seem far larger and more detailed, and is better for reviewing images as a result. Similarly, 16:9 video footage also has less of a letterbox effect (black bars at the top and bottom of the screen), which makes it easier to review video footage. As with the EOS 7D, live view and video capture have a dedicated switch, and a start/stop button just to the right of the viewfinder. Video capture – one of the key features of the 5D Mark II – has been refined in the 5D Mark III. One improvement has been to the rolling shutter issue that can affect some cameras. It was a slight problem with the 5D Mark II, but is now even better controlled and will only be noticeable to those who pan extremely quickly. Those using the camera’s built-in microphone will be pleased that the 5D Mark III has a headphone socket for live audio monitoring. Like its predecessor, the 5D Mark III also has an external microphone socket. The new sensor produces excellent image quality, but one feature that is lacking is the clean HDMI output to an external device for recording. Unlike the Nikon D4, HDMI video is outputted at 720p, but has data on the feed so it is not suitable for external capture. While the 5D Mark III is one of, if not the best camera for video capture, there are a few touches that would have really set it apart from its competitors. One of these would have been an articulated screen. Sadly, it is difficult to do this while maintaining the high level of weatherproofing that photographers demand. White Balance and Colour One thing that always impresses me when using Canon EOS models is the strength of the colours delivered straight from the camera. Even in the standard setting, images are bright and vivid, and skies in particular look full of detail. The new picture style button makes it quick and easy to switch styles, and there are three custom settings. Each style can have its colour, contrast, saturation and colour
        tone adjusted, and the monochrome style replaces the saturation and colour tone with filter effect and toning effect options. The 5D Mark III’s auto white balance setting works well, producing good neutral results whether shooting inside or out. I prefer a hint of coloured light left in a scene, so I found myself tweaking the white balance of raw images ever so slightly. Those who shoot JPEG images would benefit from using the preset or custom white balance settings to get the best results from the 5D Mark III.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'The Canon EOS 5D Mark IV does bring some enticing new features to the fore, but arguably it’s the new 30.4-million-pixel sensor that steals the limelight. The sensor’s performance at high ISO, combined with its radically improved dynamic range, makes it markedly better than the EOS 5D Mark III when it comes to returning high levels of detail to shadowed areas in post-production and shooting images with less noise in low-light. The addition of DCI 4K video is likely to allure filmmakers as well as those purely focused on stills photography, but its 1.74x crop factor and lack of a clean 4K HDMI output and log shooting options are factors that could put videographers off. For the enthusiast and pro photographer looking for a great performing all-rounder, the EOS 5D Mark IV ticks a lot of the right boxes. It handles well, it’s built to a robust standard, and it adds long overdue features such as Wi-Fi, GPS and touchscreen control. Canon will argue that a fixed screen helps to improve its weather sealing, but having recently used cameras with excellent tilting displays, it did feel something of an inconvenience having to lie on the floor to compose low-level shots. The debate of whether future models in the 5D series should have a tilting screen or not continues. Improvements to the 61-point AF system will benefit those who regularly shoot with teleconverters and the spritely autofocus performance in live view brings it bang up to date with the speed of other DSLRs in Canon’s EOS line-up. As for Dual Pixel Raw, it’s an innovation that has its uses, particularly when you’re shooting images with an extremely shallow depth of field, but from my personal experience it slowed down my workflow a little too much and as a result would only be used sparingly. The EOS 5D Mark IV is the most advanced 5D-series model we’ve seen to date, but now priced at $2299 or £2790 (body only) it will leave a big dent in your wallet whether you upgrade or buy it from new. Those who own an EOS 5D Mark III and are content with the image quality produced by their 22.3-million-pixel CMOS sensor will find it hard justifying an upgrade. Original EOS 5D and EOS 5D Mark II users who skipped the Mark III are more likely to justify an upgrade. As all-round full-frame DSLRs go, the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV remains an excellent DSLR and great value at its current price. Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review: Full specification'
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Canon EOS 5D Mark IV has been out for a number of years now, but with Canon’s focus moving to mirrorless cameras , does the 5D Mark IV still offer a compelling option? Find out in this review, as you may be impressed by how it performs, particularly when you factor in the second-hand prices for this model! Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review: Introduction Canon’s EOS 5D dynasty stretches back to 2005 and it has proved incredibly popular fuelled by a succession of superb Canon DSLRs . Essentially, the full-frame EOS 5D series was just one step down from the flagship, deep-bodied EOS-1 family and the two ranges shared many features and technologies. The EOS 5D series had the advantage of a more compact but still rugged body and the emphasis was very much on image quality rather than out and out speed which was more the province of the EOS-1 models. At a glance: The EOS 5D Mark IV might yet prove to be Canon’s last model in its full-frame DSLR series but what a wonderful picture-making machine it has proved to be for photographers of all genres. The camera is still available new and it has been around long enough for there to be thriving used and second-hand market. Its tough, nicely proportioned body houses a full-frame CMOS sensor that boasts a resolution of 30.4MP and the camera’s processing power means you can shoot full-size Raws at 7fps. Add a native ISO range of 100 to 32,000 expandable to ISO 50-102,400 and a 61 zone AF system and you have a camera that can satisfy the most demanding user and photo situation. Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review: Features Since the arrival of the EOS 5D Mark III in 2012, we’ve seen many new developments and technologies roll out across Canon’s line-up of DSLRs. We’re used to seeing a new sensor in each iteration in the 5D-series and this latest model continues that trend. It boasts a completely new 30.4-million-pixel CMOS sensor that’s quite a jump up from the 22.3-million-pixel CMOS sensor fitted inside the EOS 5D Mark III . The improved sensitivity range of ISO 100-32,000 (expandable to ISO 50-102,400) combines with developments to the noise-processing algorithm to enhance its performance in low-light – something we’ll touch on in more detail later in this review. The EOS 5D Mark IV’s sensor now benefits from Dual Pixel CMOS AF, making it the second full-frame DSLR in Canon’s line-up to feature such technology. This sensor-based phase-detection AF system has been employed to overcome slow focusing speeds in live view and works on the principle of splitting all the effective pixels on the surface of the sensor into two individual photodiodes – one for left and one for right. Each of these photodiodes can be read separately, resulting in faster phase-detection autofocus while simultaneously being used for image capture. In addition, the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system supports Servo AF when shooting stills in live view, opening up the opportunity to pinpoint focus on a subject and track it as it moves through the frame while the shutter button is half depressed. Canon’s engineers have been hard at work experimenting with other ways to utilise the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and have come up with an entirely new innovation that’s called Dual Pixel Raw. The idea behind this technology is that it creates Dual Pixel raw files that contain a pair of images shot from two slightly different points of view. When these files are processed through Canon’s Digital Photo Professional (DPP) software, users have the opportunity to perform unique image adjustments such as fine-tuning the position of maximum sharpness. Keeping on the theme of focusing, the new camera is equipped with the same AF system as that found inside Canon’s flagship DSLR, the EOS-1D X Mark II . The 61 AF points have been given a wider area in which to operate – an 8 per cent vertical expansion in the central area, and 24 per cent more vertical expansion in the peripheral area – offering greater freedom about where subjects can be placed when composing. When light levels drop users can rely on the camera’s ability to focus down to -3EV using the viewfinder, or -4EV in live-view mode and users of teleconverters will be pleased to hear that all 61 AF points on offer are f/8 compatible. There are also five dual cross-type points in the centre that are sensitive down to f/2.8, and as many as 21 cross-type points that can be selected at f/8 for greater precision. In the past, all EOS 5D-series models have featured a single processor, but for the first time the sensor teams up with a pair of image processors. A DIGIC 6 processor is allocated to metering and works in harmony with Canon’s 150K RGB+IR metering sensor, while a second DIGIC 6+ processor is in charge of handling the camera’s high-speed image processing. This has allowed the camera to shoot faster than its predecessor, albeit by 1fps, with an improved buffer depth. The Mark IV can rattle out a burst at up to 7fps set to continuous high and can shoot a continuous burst
        at up to 4.3fps in live view with AF tracking. Silent continuous shooting is also possible at up to 3fps, just like it was on the EOS 5D Mark III. Canon’s 5D-series has a strong legacy in video and the EOS 5D Mark IV offers cinematic DCI 4K video capture (4096×2160) at 30/25/24fps for the first time. There’s also the option to extract 8.8-million-pixel JPEG images directly from 4K movie footage. Full HD recording is also available up to 60fps, together with 120fps or 100fps recording at 720p. Microphone and headphone inputs are provided, and an HDMI connection provides full audio and uncompressed full HD output to external recorders and video monitors, although the same can’t be said for 4K. Another first and long-overdue addition to the EOS 5D-series is built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, which has been added alongside built-in GPS for those who wish to geotag their shots with location data. The camera also gets support for the International Press and Telecommunications Council’s system (IPTC), which essentially enables users to assign additional details and information about an image to the EXIF data before it’s submitted to galleries and picture desks. So we’re led to believe it’s a feature that has been requested by professionals who demand faster ways of speeding up workflow. Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review: Dual Pixel Raw Dual Pixel Raw, which is a new innovation that is unique to the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV, utilises both photodiodes on the camera’s 30.4-million-pixel sensor. During Dual Pixel raw shooting, a single raw file saves two images into the file. One image consists of image data from both photodiodes, while the other image is designed to record image data from just one set of photodiodes. This means the Dual Pixel Raw files contains a normal image as well as parallax information, which can be measured and subject distance information extrapolated. When a Dual Pixel Raw file is processed through Canon’s Digital Photo Professional (DPP) software, photographers are given the option to perform one of three types of unique image adjustments – Image micro adjustments, bokeh shift and ghosting reduction. Image micro adjustment allows users to fine-tune the position of maximum sharpness – just imagine you’ve shot a super shallow-depth-of-field portrait where the eyes aren’t quite as pin-sharp as you’d hoped before having the option to correct it during post-processing. This is exactly what Dual Pixel raw has the power to do. The other two adjustments you can make in DPP include bokeh shift, which allows out-of-focus highlights to be shifted horizontally so they coincide better with in-focus elements, and ghosting reduction, which can be used to reduce the appearance of artefacts like flare. But does it work? You can find out how well it works in practice in the performance section of this review. Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review: Build & Handling Canon has tinkered with the design of its EOS 5D-series since the original and you get the sense the company has now reached a stage where not a great deal more can be done to make its handling any better than it already is. Canon says the handgrip and thumb rest are both designed fractionally deeper, but in truth you’ll be hard pushed to notice a difference on the new model from the EOS 5D Mark III. The same is true of the camera’s weight. The EOS 5D Mark IV sheds 50g off the EOS 5D Mark III by introducing a new mirror box assembly that’s similar to the one used within the EOS 5DS and EOS 5DS R . This assembly uses fewer springs and more cams and gears, with a new cam added to help eliminate mirror bounce. While we’re all for minimising internal vibrations, the 50g it loses in weight isn’t blatantly obvious when you switch between the Mark IV and Mark III. It should also be noted that the sound of the shutter remains much the same as that of the 5D Mark III. Like that of its peers, the EOS 5D Mark IV’s body is made of magnesium alloy, which gives it a reassuringly solid feel in the hand and the sense that it will survive the demands of enthusiasts and pros. Like with previous generations, Canon has looked at enhancing its robustness with improved weather seals around the body to ensure dirt and moisture do not enter the internals. On the exterior of the body there aren’t too many changes, with buttons and dials falling nicely to hand in the same way they did on the Mark III. The AF joystick now has a knurled texture to it much like the EOS-1D X Mark II and just offset from this there’s a new customisable push button that can be located easily when the viewfinder is raised to your eye. It’s assigned to controlling the AF area selection as default, but you’ll still need to hit the AF-point selection button first on the corner of the body before you can use it to toggle through the various AF area settings. Alternatively, this small push button can be appointed to AE lock, AE lock (hold), ISO and exposure compensation. As well as being set up from the main menu, it can be
        customised from the custom settings that are presented in the Quick menu. Something we’re yet to comment on that plays a role in the camera’s operation is the 5D Mark IV’s LCD screen. Although it’s similar to the Mark III’s in that it’s the same size (3.2in) and remains fixed as opposed to being the tilting-type, the resolution has increased from 1.04 million dots to 1.62 million dots and now supports touch control. It’s hard not to be impressed at how well the screen reacts to light touches, especially its accuracy, despite some of the menu icons and sub-menus being on the small side. Existing 5D-series users are most likely to find that they use the camera’s buttons and dials in the traditional way, but there are times, such as when you want to quickly navigate between settings in the quick menu, that the touch screen has its advantages. It can also be used in playback mode to swipe through images – an intuitive way of reviewing images, but it’s not as fast as using the quick control dial. The same can be said for zooming in to images in playback mode. Due to the screen being that much smaller than a smartphone or tablet, you’ll find you have to repeat finger gestures a few times to inspect images at close magnification before zooming out. This is where a double-tap option to magnify images to inspect sharpness followed by another double tap to zoom out again would be advantageous. On the whole, though, the touch-screen functionality works well and gives users better choice over how the camera is set up. Other minor body changes involve the remote port being relocated to the front corner of the body from the side. This has freed up room at the side for the 3.5mm mic port to sit directly above the headphone socket and a USB 3.0 port below the HDMI out input. On the opposite side of the body is the same dual-card-slot arrangement that accepts CompactFlash and SD memory cards. The frustrating news for those looking at the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV as a potential upgrade from the 5D Mark III is that it’s not compatible with the BG-11 battery grip. This slightly short sighted approach from Canon means that those who own a BG-11 grip won’t be able to make the most of it and rules out interchanging grips between cameras. Users of the Mark IV who’d like to duplicate controls when shooting vertically and slot in an additional battery will be forced to buy the Canon BG-E20 (£339). Other than adding the small push button next to the AF joystick, this grip is virtually identical to the BG-11. Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review: Performance With the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV having two processors as opposed to one, and one of these exclusively looking after the camera’s image processing, there will be many who hoped for a big improvement in terms of speed. As it stands, the new model is capable of shooting a continuous burst just 1fps than its predecessor. Loaded with a SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB CompactFlash card, it managed to rattle out 22 raw files before its buffer kicked in. This is four more than we recorded with the same card loaded in an EOS 5D Mark III, but not quite the dramatic improvement or big step up we’d been expecting. Switching the image quality setting from raw to JPEG let the camera off its leash and it managed to rattle out an unlimited number of JPEGs at 7fps, with its predecessor doing the same albeit at 6fps. Enabling Dual Pixel raw sees the frame rate drop from 7fps and after three frames of continuous shooting in this mode the camera slowed signs of slowing down. It’s fairly obvious the speed benefits are fairly modest over the EOS 5D Mark III and will be much more significant for EOS 5D Mark II and original 5D users who feel they’re more restricted by their 3.9fps and 3fps respective burst rates. As mentioned earlier, there is a silent mode as well as a continuous silent mode that allows users to shoot more discreetly at up to 3fps. Unlike some mirrorless cameras that are capable of shooting completely silently thanks to their electronic shutters, the ‘slap’ in silent mode remains audible. The shutter mechanism is clearly dampened, but naming it a ‘quiet’ or ‘less unobtrusive’ shutter mode instead of ‘silent’, would be far more accurate. With a 61-point AF system borrowed from Canon EOS-1D X, we expected a pro-level autofocus performance and that’s exactly what you get. Whether it’s used in single or continuous AF, in good light or poor light, it goes about its business of acquiring focus accurately at a rapid pace. The AF case-sensitivity settings it carries over from the Mark III work wonders and the new push button takes the hassle away of having to nip into the menu to change the AF area mode on the fly. Activating live view and experimenting with the AF method to FlexiZone Single AF, and the AF mode to Servo AF revealed the true benefit of Dual Pixel AF. The speed of focusing in live view has come on tenfold since the EOS 5D Mark III and the live tracking also works well provided your subject doesn’t
        move too erratically or shift outside the boundary that’s displayed on-screen. A majority of the images taken during my testing were shot with the camera set to its evaluative-metering mode. I found the metering system performed exceptionally and on the whole did an excellent job of ensuring the highlights weren’t clipped. Only very occasionally did I find myself dialling in -0.3EV in high-contrast scenes. For scenes that might be harder to expose, there’s also spot, partial and centreweighted modes to choose from. Keen to explore the practical advantages of Dual Pixel raw and the working benefits it brings to pro and enthusiast photographers, I started out by enabling the function from the main menu. You’re given subtle clues to when it’s active, the DPR abbreviation being displayed on the top-plate LCD and also in the viewfinder when it’s selected from the viewfinder display options. After shooting a series of shallow depth-of-field portraits at apertures ranging from f/1.4 to f/2.8, I picked out a few files that weren’t quite as pin-sharp at the point of focus as I would have liked with the hope of improving them. The giveaway of the level of adjustment you have in the Dual Pixel RAW Optimizer that’s located within Canon’s Digital Photo Professional (DPP) software is in the name microadjustment. It’s important not to misinterpret image microadjustment as a way of turning poorly focused images into pin-sharp shots – you’re simply not given this kind of level of control. For shots where you’ve almost nailed the focus, but it’s not razor sharp, it’s possible to adjust the image and bring sharpness back to a desired area. In answer to my earlier question of whether Dual Pixel raw actually works, the answer is yes it does – just don’t expect large tolerances of control. An attempt at using Bokeh shift revealed that this can also be used successfully to adjust the position of out-of-focus areas, or ‘bokeh’ to enhance composition, but just like image microadjustment, the tolerance of top to bottom adjustment is very small. The addition of Wi-Fi connectivity adds another string to the Mark IV’s bow. Having the option to transfer images directly to a smartphone or tablet out in the field can be valuable for photographers who need to share images instantly with clients or those who like to post via the means of social media. To establish the connection between camera and mobile device you’re required to root through the main menu to the communication settings, but having the option to assign the built-in wireless settings to one of the customisable buttons could make this process faster. It goes without saying that using the camera for long periods with Wi-Fi switched on does have a detrimental affect on battery life so you’ll want to use it vigilantly. Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review: Dynamic range, resolution and noise The question many photographers want to know, particularly those who already own an EOS 5D Mark III, is how well the new 30.4-million-pixel performs and by what margin is it better than the 22.3-million pixel sensor as used in its predecessor. Although it doesn’t quite match the staggering level of detail resolved by the EOS 5DS and 5DS R models, the sensor resolves exceptionally fine detail as our lab results illustrate. The major leap forward in terms of image quality is found in the EOS 5D Mark IV’s improved dynamic range and noise performance, which is aided by the move to on-chip analogue-to-digital conversion. Users are given much greater latitude when it comes to returning detail to shadowed regions, and with the ability of being able to push raw files further, users are given greater confidence to underexpose images in order to preserve highlight detail. View our Canon EOS 5D Mark IV sample image gallery. Dynamic range The EOS 5D Mark IV’s dynamic range offers a notable improvement over its predecessor. Our lab results tell us it offers a 1.6EV improvement in dynamic range over the EOS 5D Mark III at ISO 100. The astonishing 13.7EV readout is the highest dynamic range figure we’ve ever recorded on an EOS DSLR and it manages to stay above 10EV right up to ISO 1,600. Results at ISO 3,200, 6,400 and 12,800 drop to 8.5EV, 7.4EV and 6.5EV respectively, and it’s only when the sensitivity is pushed to ISO 51,200 that we see the dynamic range figure drop below the critical 6EV. This extremely impressive dynamic range performance is welcome news for those who wish to return detail to shadowed regions with minimal noise as a result. Resolution Unlike the EOS 5D Mark III, which resolved almost exactly the same level of detail as the EOS 5D Mark II, the EOS 5D Mark IV’s 30.4-million pixel sensor resolves a finer level of detail than its forerunner. A close inspection of our resolution chart shows it resolves a maximum of 3,400l/ph at ISO 100, 3,200l/ph at ISO 400 and 3,000 at ISO 800. Detail remains very high when you reach ISO 1,600 and ISO 3,200, with 2,800l/ph being resolved up to ISO 6,400. As you
        begin to push the sensitivity higher, fine detail starts to get lost with the introduction of noise, although the sensor shows it’s still more than capable of resolving 2,600l/ph up to its sensitivity ceiling of ISO 32,000 before expansion. Pushing to its H1 (ISO 51,200) and H2 (ISO 102,400) settings sees the level of detail drop to 2,400l/ph and 2,200l/ph respectively. Below we show details from our resolution chart test pattern (right). Multiply the number beneath the lines by 200 to give the resolution in lines per picture height. Noise A higher density of pixels on the same sensor surface area can often translate to more noise at pixel level. However, Canon has worked its magic to ensure that the EOS 5D Mark IV delivers an admirable noise response. An inspection of raw files captured through the sensitivity range displayed clean noise-free results between ISO 100 and 800. Push to ISO 1,600 and you’ll start to see luminance noise appearing, which becomes increasingly evident when you push to ISO 3,200 and ISO 6,400. ISO 3,200 is very usable, and so is ISO 6,400 with some careful application of noise reduction. I’d consider ISO 12,800 to be the upper limit of where I’d want to push the sensitivity on a regular basis, whereas previously on the EOS 5D Mark III I was hesitant to push much beyond ISO 6,400. Detail and colour saturation hold up impressively at ISO 25,600, but the dominance of noise at this setting restricts it to emergency use. The extended ISO 51,200 and ISO 102,400 both see a drop in saturation and should be avoided.'

    - type: excerpt
      value: The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is one of Canon’s most affordable full-frame DSLRs, with a 26MP sensor, 6.5fps continuous shooting, 45 AF-points, and FullHD video. But could it be one of the best Canon DSLRs – find out in our full review. What is the Canon EOS 6D Mark II? The release of the Canon EOS 6D Mark II provided a new, junior full-frame DSLR for enthusiasts to get excited about. It’s positioned below the EOS 5D Mark IV and above the EOS 7D Mark II , entering the market with a price of around $1399 / £1349 (body only). Since then the 32.5MP Canon EOS 90D has come along, but that has a smaller APS-C sensor and doesn’t offer the full frame experience of this camera. Perhaps more significant than this is the rise of mirrorless cameras since the 6D Mark II’s launch in June 2017, and in particular the Canon EOS RP , which offers the same 26MP sensor in a smaller mirrorless body. Nevertheless, the EOS 6D Mark II and its chunky DSLR handling will still appeal to traditional photographers who enjoy optical viewfinders, long battery life and access to huge choice of the best Canon EF lenses . When the original Canon EOS 6D arrived on the scene, it quickly became popular with enthusiast photographers who were looking to progress from an APS-C DSLR into full-frame photography, without having to make a huge financial investment and a giant leap up to the EOS 5D Mark III . Needless to say, it’s a camera that’s been well received over the years and fulfilled a missing link in Canon’s EOS series. The original EOS 6D remains one of the best used DSLRs today. There are big savings in choosing the EOS 6D Mark II ahead of the EOS 5D Mark IV, the next full frame Canon DSLR in the range, and it makes the jump to full-frame far more appealing for those who take photography seriously. We’re often used to paying a premium for something new or to upgrade, so it was refreshing to find that Canon’s latest full-frame model was a little cheaper than the original EOS 6D at launch. Although mirrorless cameras now dominate the market, Canon DSLRs are still highly competitive alternatives for users who prefer the DSLR body design, and there’s no shortage of lenses for these cameras either, and our guide to the best Canon EF lenses showcases some of the best. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – Features The EOS 6D’s 20.2-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor has been replaced by a new 26.2-megapixel full-frame CMOS chip that hadn’t been seen before in an EOS model, but has since been used in the Canon EOS RP. Since then, Canon has moved towards 20MP sensor variants ( EOS R6 ) and 24MP versions ( EOS R6 Mark II , EOS R8 ), which might be technically lower in resolution but are more modern sensors. Still, compared to its predecessor that offered a native ISO range of 100-25,600, the Canon EOS 6D Mark II offers a broader ISO 100-40,000 range, which is expandable to ISO 50-102,400. Like other more recent Canon DSLRs, this sensor teams up with Canon’s then-latest DIGIC 7 image processor. The pairing promises improvements to both image quality and performance speed. Image information is processed 14x faster than Canon’s DIGIC 6 image processor (the original EOS 6D featured a DIGIC 5+ image processor) and it can now shoot a continuous burst at up of 6.5fps, which is 2fps faster. Canon claims it can sustain a burst of 150 JPEGs, or 21 raw files at 6.5fps. The EOS 6D II does offer considerable improvements over its predecessor. Speed benefits are also gained in live view thanks to the integration of Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology. We’ve seen this technology rolled out across a number of other Canon DSLRs in the past few years, including the EOS 80D, EOS 7D Mark II and EOS 5D Mark IV. As well as providing high-performance Servo AF tracking and smoother focusing, it rules out the sluggish autofocus performance in live view mode that’s associated with older Canon DSLRs lacking this breakthrough technology. For those unfamiliar with Dual Pixel CMOS AF, it’s a sensor-based, phase-detection autofocus system that works by splitting all the effective pixels on the surface of the sensor into two individual photodiodes – one for left and one for right. Each of these photodiodes can be read separately, allowing faster phase-detection autofocus while simultaneously being used for image capture. It’s a system that’s become beneficial to photographers and videographers who’d like to shoot quickly, without having to put up with clumsy focusing in Live View. It now forms the basis for the AF systems in all of Canon’s mirrorless cameras. The Canon EOS 6D Mark II has a revised AF system that’s considerably more advanced than the 11-point AF system with one cross-type point on the original EOS 6D. This latest model inherits the 45-point all-cross-type AF system from the EOS 80D. Of the 45 AF points on offer, 27 are f/8 compatible, with the centre point sensitive down to f/2.8. The working range of the AF system is the same as before, however, and is sensitive to -3EV
        to 18EV. The camera’s metering is left in the capable hands of a 7560-pixel RGB IR metering sensor. We’ve seen this used before in the likes of the EOS 77D and it has proven to be reliable at delivering consistently accurate exposures. To counteract the rapid on/off pulsing seen with some artificial lights, the camera also inherits Canon’s anti-flicker technology that first made its debut in the EOS 7D Mark II. Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is built into the camera, offering photographers the freedom to control it wirelessly from a smartphone or tablet that’s running Canon’s Camera Connect app. There’s also Bluetooth connectivity to form a permanent connection to a smartphone – a feature previously seen on the EOS M5, EOS 800D and EOS 77D. It allows your phone to be used as a remote control at any time, without having to mess around setting up a Wi-Fi connection between devices. The Bluetooth connection can also instruct the camera to fire up its Wi-Fi for when you want to copy images across to your phone, or use full remote control with Live View. One further feature of note is the 6D’s built-in GPS functionality, which can be used to geotag images with GPS coordinates and can help retrace your steps when it comes to writing accurate image captions that describe your whereabouts. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – Build and Design One of the practical benefits of choosing the Canon EOS 6D Mark II over the Canon EOS 5D Mark III or Canon EOS 5D Mark IV is that it’s smaller and lighter. If you’re familiar with the size and weight of an EOS 5D model then you’ll instantly become aware of its compact statue and slightly different feel in the hand when it’s picked up. If size is an issue for you, though, be aware that it’s still considerably bulkier than most of Canon’s mirrorless models, particularly the EOS RP. Although the handgrip isn’t quite as large as it is on the EOS 5D model, and the grippy leather-effect finish doesn’t extend all the way around the side of the body, it feels very comfortable and provides a satisfying level of grip to get a solid grasp when using the camera with long and heavy lenses. Compared to the original EOS 6D, its dimensions are a fraction smaller. The reduction in size brings disappointing news to existing EOS 6D customers in that the older BG-E13 battery grip is no longer compatible. Those who’d like to improve handling in the portrait format and increase the camera’s stamina by powering it with a pair of LP-E6N batteries will need to buy the BG-E21 battery grip ($199 / £219). The chassis of the camera is made from aluminium alloy and polycarbonate resin with glass fibre, whereas the body is constructed from polycarbonate resin with special conductive fibre and glass fibre in some areas. Canon is well aware that it’s likely to fall into the hands of those who like to use a camera off-limits, or where the going gets tough, and has provisioned for this by making it dust and drip-resistant. It isn’t weather-sealed to the same standard as the EOS 5D Mark IV, but it survived a brief rain shower and had no problem keeping moisture at bay in typically damp Scottish weather. Generally speaking, the camera is just as easy to operate as the original. Much of this comes down to the button placement being virtually identical to before. The on/off switch shoulders the left corner of the body, just below the mode dial, and advanced controls such as an AF-ON button perform back button focusing. Other buttons on the top plate let you access AF modes, drive modes, ISO and metering modes. The camera lacks a button to take control of exposure compensation. In program, shutter priority and aperture priority modes, the rear scroll dial can be used to control this. However, you’ll want to bear in mind that it’s possible to knock the dial accidentally if you don’t use the lock switch beneath. In manual mode you’re forced to go into the main menu or quick menu to access exposure compensation, which is a bit of a faff. It’s possible to reassign a button to exposure compensation from the custom functions menu, but in hindsight I’d have preferred it if Canon had merged it with the ISO button as it does on its EOS 5D-series. Another difference between this camera and the EOS 5D-series is that you don’t get an intuitive joystick controller to nudge the AF point around the frame with your thumb. Like the original EOS 6D, this is ditched in preference of a four-way directional pad inset within a rotating rear command wheel, which now has a finer knurled texture. A new addition to the body, albeit a minor one, is the small button that’s located between the shutter button and top-plate dial. It’s used to toggle through the AF point selection choices and makes them easier and faster to get to. The camera’s single SD card slot at the side rules out any possibility of backing up files to a second card, spilling over to a second card when one becomes full, or assigning one card to the purpose of stills recording and the other
        to video. If any of these forms of backup are essential for your type of work, you’ll be better off looking at the EOS 5D Mark III or EOS 5D Mark IV. One of the great things about the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is how quick existing Canon users will be able to pick it up and become familiar with it. It won’t feel intimidating for those upgrading from a double-digit or triple-digit Canon APS-C DSLR and neither does it feel too basic or like a huge step down from a more advanced EOS 5D-series model. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – Viewfinder and Screen Another significant advantage this camera has over many other full-frame DSLRs is its 3in, 1040k-dot vari-angle touchscreen, which replaces the 3in, 1040k-dot fixed screen of old. A vari-angle screen on a Canon full-frame DSLR has been a long time coming, and having the option of pulling the screen out and tilting it to your preferred angle gives it a distinct advantage over a fixed screen when attempting to shoot from tricky angles or unusual perspectives. I can imagine many 5D-series users will feel envious of this screen, but as Canon has outlined before, a compromise would have to be made in the form of weather resistance if this feature were to be introduced to a new 5D-series camera. In typical fashion, the touchscreen is super-responsive and reacts to the lightest of touches when used to navigate the menus or zoom and swipe through images in playback mode. There is the option to increase the sensitivity from the menu, but there’s very little gain to be had from doing so. If controlling a camera via the screen isn’t for you, it can be disabled altogether from the touch control settings. Above the screen you get an optical viewfinder that provides 98% coverage and 0.71x magnification. As well as revealing all the usual exposure and autofocus information, it can be set up to display the drive mode, battery level, alert symbol, flicker detection and image quality. There’s a nice large rubber eye cup to cushion the viewfinder against your eye and diopter control just off to the corner to adjust it to your eyesight. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – Autofocus The number of active autofocus points has increased by 34 compared to the original. This is quite a jump, but it’s important to stress that the grouping of these AF points are closely positioned and are pretty central in the frame. With the viewfinder raised to my eye, it didn’t take long to realise that the AF points don’t cover as wide an area of the frame as the 61 points you get on the EOS 5D Mark III or Mark IV. The central group of 15 AF points are arranged in a 3 x 5 grid, with the top and bottom line sitting a fraction higher than the two groups of 15 AF points either side. To reposition the AF point, by default you have to press the AF point selection button on the corner of the body before using the four-way controller. However there’s the option to head into the custom controls directly from the quick menu and assign the multi-controller to direct AF point selection, which allows you to reposition the AF point across the frame slightly faster. Hit the AF point selection button followed by the the central Set button and the camera will shift the AF point back to the centre point in an instant. The accuracy and acquisition speed of the autofocus seems hasty in isolation, but a side-by-side comparison with the EOS 5D Mark IV in a low-light scene with both cameras set to AI Servo highlighted it’s marginally slower than its sibling. Switch to Live View and you’ll see a vast improvement over the original, thanks to the integration of Dual Pixel AF. There’s no more waiting around for the camera to lock onto a subject; no sooner have you half-depressed the shutter button, the AF beeps to acknowledge correct focus has been achieved. In practice, this has completely transformed the experience of shooting in Live View. The way you’re given options over selecting continuous autofocus (AI Servo) and three AF methods means the camera can be used in Live View to successfully obtain sharp results of moderately fast-moving subjects too. Where it has greater difficulty is when it’s asked to focus on a subject travelling directly towards the camera at very high speed. Some users may also wish to take advantage of relocating the AF point or AF area using the touchscreen, which works well when it’s combined with the touch shutter function. This does highlight the fact that DSLRs essentially have two viewing systems and two AF systems, one for viewfinder photography and one for live view. It’s one of the factors that make mirrorless cameras a simpler alternative, in that the EVF and the rear screen show the same things and have the same autofocus system. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – Video It might come as a shock that the camera doesn’t support 4K-movie recording, like  the EOS 5D Mark IV. In its absence you get Full HD (1920 x 1080) video at up to 60p and you’re provided with a 3.5mm port to plug in an external microphone. The camera also lacks
        a headphone port to monitor audio levels, but there are some particularly useful functions in the Canon Connect app that let you review audio levels in video mode, adjust the audio sensitivity, and control the wind filter and attenuator. We’re yet to see the app offer the option to control the camera’s 4K time-lapse mode, but who knows, we may see this added in the future. The EOS 6D Mark II also became the first full-frame EOS to include 5-axis in-camera digital stabilisation for movie capture. The good news is that video footage can be stabilised even when non-IS lenses are used, and the electronic stabilisation can be combined with optical stabilisation with compatible EF lenses. It does a reasonable job compensating for jolty movements and can be used in combination with a shoulder mount rig or tracking rail to achieve even smoother-looking handheld footage. It goes without saying that the EOS 6D Mark II won’t be the first choice for professional videographers wanting to shoot the highest-resolution movies. That being said, its 4K time-lapse mode, 5-axis in-camera digital stabilisation and vari-angle screen will be well received by enthusiasts who like to dabble with video from time to time. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – 4K time-lapse mode The EOS 6D Mark II was the first Canon DSLR to offer a 4K time-lapse movie mode with a built-in intervalometer. The 4K time-lapse mode is found from the menu settings in Live View, and once you’ve selected the resolution you can set your preferred interval time by hours, minutes and seconds. As well as being able to manually enter the number of shots you’d like to capture, you’re given other options such as keeping the exposure fixed from the first frame, disabling the beep as an image is taken, and controlling the LCD auto-off function. As I discovered, there’s no better way of learning how this creative movie mode works than by giving it a try. The camera automatically calculates the duration of the time-lapse and playback time based on the interval and number of shots selected, which is helpfully displayed at the bottom of the time-lapse movie menu settings. Commencing a 4K time-lapse couldn’t be easier. You’re prompted to set and test your exposure settings first, before hitting the start-stop button and then the shutter button to start the time-lapse. Once the time-lapse has ended, the camera automatically disables the time-lapse movie mode and merges the recorded frames together to create a movie (.mov) file that can then be reviewed in playback. It’s a powerful feature capable of producing striking results and makes the process of capturing movement of slowly changing scenes much more accessible. I wouldn’t be surprised if this feature is inherited by other EOS models in the near future. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – Performance Canon DSLRs are known for being reliable performers. After shooting with the camera for a week in the Scottish Highlands, the EOS 6D Mark II certainly lived up to my expectations. Compared to some battery-thirsty mirrorless cameras I had been using of late, it was nice to travel with only a single battery that had ample charge for a full day of shooting. The battery lasts for around 1200 shots, but be wary that using Wi-Fi will reduce it faster. It’s often forgotten that the remaining power can be checked as a percentage from the battery info in the main menu as well as the shutter count since the last charge. Although it won’t be the first choice for action, wildlife or sports photographers who like to shoot faster than 6.5fps, the way in which the Canon EOS 6D Mark II delivers punchy images, faithful colour and strong results at high sensitivity settings makes it a very versatile option for those who like to shoot a variety of subjects. Keeping on the topic of speed, I managed to rattle off 21 raw images and 77 large JPEG images to my SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB Class 10 SDXC card at 6.5fps before its buffer limit was reached. Switching the drive mode from continuous to silent highlighted that the slap of the shutter mechanism is suppressed ever so slightly, but don’t expect people not to hear you shooting in a very quiet environment – for example, in a church at a wedding. Describing it as a slightly quieter shutter mode instead of silent is far more accurate. Very little exposure adjustment was required during testing. The metering system analyses scenes admirably and only occasionally did I find myself dialling in -0.3EV to prevent highlights being clipped in the brightest area of an image. Users will feel confident using the camera in its evaluative metering mode, but for scenes that are harder to expose there’s always spot, partial and centre-weighted to choose from. Canon provides a good amount of control over image processing settings. The default Auto picture style determines what the camera thinks is the best processing and rendering settings for any given scene. For those who’d like a more consistent style across a set of JPEG images,
        however, there are seven other picture styles to choose from. If you’d like your image to reflect the scene as you see it with your eyes, Faithful is a great place to start. In playback users get a fine selection of raw processing options with the ability to save an image as a new file after it’s been edited. The way shots can be rated in-camera before they’re loaded into software also plays a part in speeding up workflow. From the custom functions menu you’re given the opportunity to dive in and reassign different settings to different buttons. This ability to change things around – such as setting the exposure lock button to enter AI Servo mode when it’s depressed – can be useful depending on the way you work. It’s even possible to switch the dial functions around so that the top dial adjusts aperture and rear dial controls shutter speed. Provided you have the latest version of the Canon’s Camera Connect app pre-installed on your mobile device, it’s possible to establish a Wi-Fi connection in seconds. Images are fast to load in the app and can be displayed in thumbnail form, alongside the date and time they were taken with the relevant metadata. With regards to shooting remotely using your smartphone or tablet, it’s possible to take control of shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Furthermore, you adjust the position of the focus point, change the AF method and set other variables including drive mode, white balance and exposure compensation. This is all in addition to being able to pre-focus and fire the shutter remotely straight from your mobile device. Overall, I found very little fault with the EOS 6D Mark II’s performance, other than finding it fell slightly short of being able to shoot 150 JPEG images at 6.5fps before its buffer was reached. It should also be noted that Canon’s claimed figure is some way short of what was previously possible on the original EOS 6D – a little surprising given that it uses Canon’s newer DIGIC 7 image processor. By way of comparison, the EOS 6D could shoot a burst of 1250 JPEGs, albeit at 4.5fps and at a lower 20.2-megapixel resolution. Canon EOS 6D Mark II – Image quality It’s always intriguing when a manufacturer launches a new camera with a new sensor that’s never been tried or tested before. The increase to 26.2-megapixels sees it resolve an exceptionally fine level of detail, narrowing the gap to the 30.4-megapixel resolution offered by its sibling, the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. The camera can’t match the high dynamic range figure previously recorded by the 5D Mark IV, but does put in a sterling noise performance that will give users the confidence needed to push up to ISO 6400 when low-light situations ask much more of the sensor. Above this, the drop in quality starts to become more noticeable, but recognisable images can still be achieved at ISO 25600. Resolution The new 26.2-megapixel sensor resolves a finer level of detail than its predecessor, with a maximum of 3400l/ph being recorded at ISO 100. Detail remains high when the sensitivity is increased to ISO 1600 and ISO 3200, with an impressive 3000l/ph being resolved right up to ISO 6400. Fine detail does eventually start to deteriorate as noise becomes more prevalent, but our results verify that it’s capable of resolving 2600l/ph up to its native sensitivity ceiling of ISO 40,000. Users will want to avoid the camera’s H1 (ISO 51200) and H2 (ISO 102400) settings. Here, the level of detail recorded drops off to 2400l/ph and 2200l/ph respectively. Dynamic Range The 12.1EV readout at ISO 100 isn’t as impressive as the incredibly high 13.7EV figure that was previously recorded by the EOS 5D Mark IV. Results at ISO 3200, 6400 and 12800 drop to 8.0EV, 7.3EV and 6.9EV respectively, and it’s only when the sensitivity it pushed to ISO 51200 that the dynamic range figure drops just below 6EV. While some may have expected a slightly higher dynamic range figure at low sensitivities, I found there’s sufficient leverage when it comes to returning detail to dark, shadowed regions in real-world use as depicted in some of the sample images that support this review. Noise The camera puts in a strong performance when it comes to handling noise. Images are free of noise at low ISO settings up to ISO 800, and it’s only at ISO 1600 that you really start noticing luminance noise creeping into dark shadowed areas. Pushing the sensitivity a stop or two higher does pronounce luminance noise, but not to the point that ISO 3200 or ISO 6400 shouldn’t be used when you need to. Apply some vigilant noise reduction to images taken at ISO 6400 and you’ll be able to create some very usable results. I’d have little reluctance setting ISO 6400 as the maximum when working in Auto ISO. Pushing up to ISO 12800 isn’t out of the question, but colours start to get a little muted at ISO 25600. As the square crops clearly illustrate, ISO 51200 and ISO 102400 should be steered well clear of unless there’s no other option. Should I buy the Canon EOS 6D Mark
        II? The EOS 6D Mark II is a stepping stone for existing Canon users to get into full-frame photography and is a viable alternative to the more advanced EOS 5D Mark IV, albeit at a higher price than you’d pay for either the Sony Alpha 7 II or Nikon D750 . But if you’re not completely wedded to the idea of a DSLR and are prepared to consider mirrorless cameras like the Sony Alpha, then the choice widens considerably. For just a little more than the price of the EOS 6D Mark II you can get very modern, very competent full frame hybrid stills/4K video cameras like the Sony Alpha 7 III, Panasonic Lumix S5 or even the Canon EOS R8 . Those thinking about a move away from a Canon APS-C DSLR will need to factor in that it isn’t just the body that will cost – the extra expense of upgrading a few EF-S lenses to a new collection of EF lenses could well see the final price soar to over $3000 / £3000. If, however, you’re weighing up the EOS 6D II against a Canon mirrorless model, remember that Canon makes an adaptor to mount EF lenses on its mirrorless models. As a versatile all-rounder, the Canon EOS 6D II puts in a respectable performance. Its snappy AF speed in Live View, sensational vari-angle touchscreen and wireless connectivity options are likely to gain interest from older EOS 5D-series users who fancy an up-to-date body, or perhaps a backup body, in a smaller form factor. When size and weight are critical– when you’re travelling, for example – I discovered that the EOS 6D Mark II really comes into its own. There are a few cons, however. The AF system has improved in terms of the number of points it offers, with no fewer than 27 that can focus down to f/8, but all the points are tightly grouped and don’t span particularly widely across the frame. In addition, it isn’t as fast or as intuitive to reposition the AF points as it is on an 5D-series model that benefits from a thumb-operated AF toggle. Its lack of dual-card slots, 4K video and dedicated exposure compensation button are other reasons that some may bypass the EOS 6D Mark II and opt for the highly regarded 5D Mark IV instead. Anyone contemplating the EOS 6D Mark II will want to consider the compromises mentioned above and question what features are absolutely essential. If a vari-angle touchscreen is fundamental to your way of working, and you feel you could benefit from shedding a few extra grams off your shoulder, it makes a strong case for itself. Making an appealing EOS 6D-series camera that doesn’t cannibalise the sales of its EOS 5D-series has always been a challenge for Canon, and while I feel it could have been future-proofed slightly better by adding a second SD card slot and 4K video, it has an advanced enough feature set to satisfy the majority of enthusiasts who feel they’re ready to buy into their first full-frame camera.

    - type: conclusion
      value: It’s all too easy to see Pentax as a brand that’s on its last legs; this is, after all, its first new camera for three years, while releases of genuinely new lenses have slowed to a trickle. The fact that it’s now apparently banking on surviving off sales to die-hard DSLR users, with no intention of making a new mirrorless system to succeed the ill-fated Q, doesn’t bode well for its long-term future, either. But this shouldn’t take away from the fact that the K-3 Mark III is a fine APS-C DSLR which in many respects is a match for the best on the market. Die-hard Pentax shooters will love it, just as long as they can stomach the sky-high price. However it’s difficult to see Canon or Nikon users changing brands, given how accomplished the EOS 90D and D500 are, respectively. Those who are prepared to shell out their £1900 will, however, find themselves proud owners of a camera that handles extremely well and is built to keep shooting in harsh conditions. It delivers fine image quality too, that’s at least a match for any of its non-full-frame peers. There are also a lot of clever and useful features on board that you won’t find anywhere else. This is, however, very much a specialist camera for those who like to shoot still images using an optical viewfinder. It can shoot in live view and record movies if you want, but the lack of screen articulation and sluggish contrast-detection AF in these modes significantly reduce their usefulness, suggesting they were hardly design priorities. Thankfully though the viewfinder itself is excellent, while the new 101-point autofocus system is a genuine advance on previous Pentax models. However, that high launch price remains a serious stumbling block. Quite simply, you can buy other cameras that are better all-rounders for rather less money. So while the Pentax K-3 Mark III is a fine DSLR, it seems likely to find only a small niche in the market.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Pentax K-3 Mark III at a glance: This might just be the longest-awaited sequel in the history of digital cameras. The Pentax K-3 Mark III is an APS-C format DSLR aimed squarely at enthusiast photographers, and notionally a follow-up to the K-3 II from 2015. But whereas that camera was a relatively minor update over the original K-3, the Mark III is a very different kettle of fish. It inherits much of the K-3 line’s DNA, with a similar body size and design, but what’s inside is almost entirely new. Indeed, almost all the key components have been upgraded, including the image sensor and processor, the autofocus and metering modules, the viewfinder and rear screen, and the in-body stabilisation system. But this comes at a significant cost; where the K-3 II was a bargain at £770 body-only, the Mark III will set you back £1,900 at launch. This makes it the most expensive APS-C DSLR on the market by some margin. To provide some context, there’s a long list of highly accomplished cameras that cost less, not least the 36MP full-frame Pentax K-1 Mark II (£1650). Likewise, the current APS-C class-leaders, Nikon’s D500 DSLR and Fujifilm’s mirrorless X-T4, cost £1499 and £1399 respectively, while the Canon EOS 90D is £1249. Meanwhile excellent full-frame mirrorless all-rounders such as the Sony Alpha 7 III and Panasonic Lumix S5 can be picked up for £1700. So the question we have to address is not only whether the K-3 Mark III hits the mark on its own terms, but also whether it makes sense in the overall market. Pentax K-3 III: Features Examining the K-3 Mark III’s main specifications gives a clue as to why it’s so highly priced. It is, arguably, the most advanced APS-C DSLR ever made. On paper it exceeds the hitherto class-leading Nikon D500 in many respects, with a higher-resolution sensor, faster shooting, a larger viewfinder, and in-body image stabilisation. There is, however, a catch; you get an even more impressive spec sheet with the Fujifilm X-T4. Let’s take a quick tour of its main features. The K-3 Mark III is built around a 26MP APS-C sensor that employs a backside-illuminated design to reduce noise and improve dynamic range. Its sensitivity range is vast, stretching from ISO 100 to 1,600,000; however such ultra-high settings usually tend to look better on the sales literature than in actual photographs. The continuous shooting speed of 12 frames per second is genuinely impressive, though, especially for a DSLR that has to flip its mirror up and down in the process. Equally its 32-frame raw buffer is very respectable. One particularly noteworthy update is the SAFOX 13 autofocus system, which provides no fewer than 101 focus points, of which 25 are cross-type. This is a major step forward from the 27-point system used on the firm’s previous APS-C DSLRs. The camera is also claimed to be capable of autofocusing in light as low as -4 EV, while a new 307,000-pixel metering sensor aids with subject identification for focus tracking purposes. Switch to live view, though, and the camera falls back onto a contrast-detection AF system, which feels distinctly outdated. When it comes to composition, the K-3 Mark III sports the largest viewfinder yet seen on an APS-C DSLR, with its 0.7x equivalent magnification providing a similar size view to most full-frame models. It’s an impressive achievement, but again tempered a little by the fact that the X-T4’s electronic finder is even bigger, at 0.77x. On the back you get a 3.2in touchscreen that is fixed, rather than articulated. The inescapable conclusion is that this is unapologetically a DSLR for photographers who love using an optical viewfinder. Five-axis in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) is built in and works with almost any lens you can use, while promising up to 5.5 stops shake reduction. This feature is now so common on mirrorless cameras that it almost comes as a surprise to remember how unusual it is on DSLRs, with Canon and Nikon relying on in-lens optical stabilisation instead. The IBIS system also delivers a range of other goodies, some of which are exclusive to Pentax. Alongside a pixel-shift multi-shot function that promises more detailed images, it can simulate the effect of an optical low-pass filter in suppressing imaging artefacts, while also offering an automatic horizon correction function, which can be really useful for hand-held shooting. Files are recorded to dual SD slots, one of which supports high-speed UHS-II media. The two cards can either be used sequentially or in backup mode with files stored to both. Alternatively, it’s possible to send raw files to one card and JPEGs to the other. Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are included for smartphone connectivity, which utilises the free Image Sync app. This provides a conventional set of features, allowing remote control of the camera from your phone either with or without live view feed, and facilitating image sharing on social media. It’s also possible to geotag your images using your phone’s
        GPS. As we’d expect the K-3 Mark III is capable of recording 4K video, complete with built-in microphone and headphone sockets for capturing and monitoring higher-quality sound. However, the fixed screen, contrast-detect autofocus and lack of advanced video features again hint that this is a facility added as much for marketing purposes as for actual use. Focal points While recognisably following the K-3 lineage, the Mark III is an almost entirely new camera. Build and Handling Enthusiast-focused Pentax DSLRs have traditionally been extremely well-built, and the K-3 Mark III continues in this vein. Its robust magnesium alloy body is dustproof and weather resistant, and certainly feels like it should shrug off harsh conditions and take accidental knocks without missing a beat. The dials all have textured rubber grips, while the buttons are large and have decent travel, which makes the camera reasonably easy to operate while wearing winter gloves. It fits nicely in your hand too, thanks to the large, rubberised grip and well-defined resting space on the back for your thumb. The most important controls are well placed for operation by your right forefinger and thumb, while a further column of buttons on the side of the lens throat is positioned within easy reach of your left thumb, just as long as you’re not supporting a heavy telephoto lens. Existing K-3 owners will find the basic control layout familiar, with dual control dials at the front and back used to change shutter speed and aperture respectively, and a pair of buttons behind the shutter release for ISO and exposure compensation. The power switch encircles the shutter button, and pulling it to a sprung position beyond the On mark stops down the aperture for depth of field preview. A prominent dial beside the viewfinder selects between viewfinder, live view and movie shooting. The K-3 Mark III also gains a third Smart Function (S.Fn) dial on the top, as previously seen on the K-1 Mark II and KP. This can be used to change five user-defined functions, which are selected between using the S.Fn button. I generally used it for ISO control, but other options include exposure compensation, drive mode, or quickly switching between autofocus set-ups optimised for static and moving subjects. A top-plate LCD panel shows your settings at a glance. On the camera’s left shoulder you’ll find the mode dial, which in addition to the usual set of choices, includes Pentax’s TAv and Sv options. The former allows you to specify both the shutter speed and aperture, with the camera adjusting the ISO to compensate, while the latter does precisely the opposite. In Program mode, spinning the front or rear dial allows you to temporarily select a specific shutter speed or aperture respectively for a sequence of shots. Tother these modes provide useful additional options for selecting your desired settings compared to other brands. In a very welcome first for a Pentax DSLR, the Mark III finally gains a joystick for positioning the focus point. This frees up the d-pad to be dedicated to changing drive mode, white balance, JPEG colour mode and LCD brightness. As a result, all the most important settings have dedicated external buttons, while pressing the Info button gives quick access to even more settings via a neatly laid-out onscreen control panel. Unlike with other cameras, though, the joystick isn’t fully integrated into the rest of the interface; for example, it can’t be used to scroll through images in playback, or navigate menus and change settings. Instead, it will often frustratingly push you back into shooting mode. Nearly every button and dial can be customised, and it’s also possible to store five different setups for quick recall via the U positions on the mode dial. As a result, it should be possible for most users to configure the K-3 Mark III to operate exactly as they’d like. So while the sheer array of controls can look daunting when you first pick it up, but with a bit of familiarisation it becomes quick and intuitive to use. Pentax K-3 Mark III: Viewfinder and screen With mirrorless cameras now comfortably outselling DSLRs, clearly the K-3 Mark III needs to offer a distinct selling point to enthusiast photographers. This comes in the form of probably the finest optical viewfinder ever seen on an APS-C DSLR. Given its size, it’s impressively bright, and I found it perfectly usable with the 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom, which has about as small a maximum aperture as you’re likely to use. An information panel beneath the viewfinder displays detailed exposure settings, including metering and drive modes. Thanks to a transparent LCD overlay, you also get a choice of gridlines and a dual-axis electronic level, while a series of small icons allow you to change the S.Fn dial function with the camera up to your eye. It’s as close as you could realistically expect to get to the levels of information provided by the electronic viewfinders of mirrorless cameras. This is still
        an optical viewfinder, though, so it can’t show any indication of how your images will turn out in terms of colour and exposure. Naturally it also gets dark when you engage depth of field preview, although it’s probably more usable than any other APS-C DSLR in this respect. The focusing ‘snap’ with manual lenses is pretty good, but for truly accurate results you’ll need to use live view. Here the 3.2in rear screen does a very creditable job; it’s sharp and clear, and the camera sensibly previews your colour and exposure settings. It also gives a much better representation of what’s going on when you engage depth of field preview. As with most other DSLRs, live view is most useful when the camera is fixed on a tripod, but the lack of a tilting screen is a real drawback, especially if you want to shoot at low or high angles. Autofocus As I touched on previously, the K-3 Mark III’s AF system is a significant advance on previous Pentax DSLRs. Of its 101 focus points, 25 are cross-type, which means that they’re capable of focusing on both horizontal and vertical detail. Only 41 points are user-selectable, though, with the remainder being used to keep track of moving subjects. The autofocus sensor covers about two-thirds of the frame width, but only about a third of its height (due to design limitations of the sub-mirror that’s used to reflect light onto the AF sensor). This means you don’t get the same kind of subject-tracking performance as the latest mirrorless cameras, which can identify and hold focus on subjects almost anywhere within the frame. In addition to being able to specify a single focus point manually, several area modes are available that vary in terms of how many points they use, and across how much of the frame they can be positioned. These are useful with erratically moving subjects that might be difficult to follow using a single focus point; indeed some of them are only available in AF-C. You can also let the camera choose the focus area itself, and in this case, it uses subject recognition to help identify the optimum point. Most obviously, the system will attempt to focus on faces even if another object is closer to the camera, which older, less sophisticated systems wouldn’t do. With only the 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom provided with my review camera, I wasn’t really able to push the AF system to its limits. Suffice to say, though, that if you mostly tend to shoot static subjects it’ll do a perfectly good job. I also found it delivered a high hit-rate in C-AF with subjects moving towards the camera, but was less successful with those moving away. Switch to live view, though, and AF performance falls back dramatically. It’s much slower and has a marked tendency to hunt for focus, especially when light levels drop. The saving grace, though, is that contrast detection AF is inherently very accurate, and the focus point can be positioned across a larger area of the frame. So it’s fine for shooting static subjects on a tripod, but not for dynamic situations. Using manual lenses on the Pentax K-3 III One of the big attractions of using Pentax DSLRs is the huge range of K-mount lenses available, dating back to 1975. While you’ll get full functionality with modern AF designs, the camera still plays nicely with manual-focus lenses. You need to enter the focal length for the IBIS system to work correctly, and the camera can be set to request this when it’s switched on. The AF system will indicate when the subject is in focus, but for the most reliable results you’ll need to use magnified live view. With the oldest fully manual lenses you need to shoot in M mode and enable use of the lens’s aperture ring in the menu. Uniquely, you can tell the camera the aperture you’ve set by spinning the rear dial, which will be recorded in the EXIF data. Pressing the green button on the back activates stop-down metering, at which point the camera will select the shutter speed and/or ISO to use. I used a couple of 1980s-vintage Tamron Adaptall-2 SP lenses, the 90mm F2.5 macro and 500mm F8 mirror, with good results. Performance Just as you’d expect from a modern camera, the Pentax K-3 Mark III is a quick, responsive camera that rarely gets in the way of shooting. One advantage of the DSLR design is that there’s barely any start-up time, so it’s ready to shoot pretty much the instant you flick the power switch, which is great for quick grab shots.  About the only confusing aspect of its operation comes when you press the metering button, as neither the viewfinder nor the LCD screen highlight what’s happening. By DSLR standards, it’s unobtrusive too, with both the mirror and shutter mechanisms being soft and well-damped. The shutter isn’t as quiet as those on most mirrorless models, though, even in live view when the mirror is locked up.  There’s no option to select a fully electronic shutter either, so it can never be completely silent. Update 20th July 2021: Firmware update 1.10 allows an electronic shutter to be
        selected, with speeds of up to 1/16000 sec. See here for more details. Metering is generally reliable, but by no means fool-proof. The standard multi-segment mode can be prone to blowing out highlights in bright contrasty conditions, so you need to get used to anticipating this and pre-emptively applying the requisite exposure compensation. The 26MP sensor offers plenty of scope for retrieving details from the shadows in raw processing, but as always, nowhere near as much latitude in the highlights. So if in doubt, it’s normally best to reduce the exposure, or perhaps engage the highlight metering mode. Out-of-camera colour rendition is strong and punchy in the default Bright mode, especially on sunny days, if perhaps with slightly over-exaggerated greens. Auto white balance is usually well-judged, too, and in general I’d be happy sharing the output on social media with just a little tweaking in Snapseed. There’s also a nicely implemented in-camera raw converter that allows you to experiment with different processing effects. Both the Pixel Shift Resolution and the Anti-Aliasing Filter Simulator modes work as expected. The former combines four shots taken in quick succession, with the sensor moved fractionally between each to sample the scene in full colour at each pixel location. This gives visibly higher detail, but the camera has to be fixed to a tripod, and ideally the subject needs to be completely static for best results, which limits its usefulness. Meanwhile, the AA modes work well to counteract false colour moiré effects that can appear when shooting fabrics or buildings. It’s just a case of remembering to turn them on in advance. In-body image stabilisation works pretty well, especially if you’re prepared to accept just a little pixel-level blur. Using the 16-85mm zoom towards its wide end, I was able to get usable images hand-held at shutter speeds as slow as 0.4sec, which is a match for Canon and Nikon’s optically stabilised lenses. The catch is that IBIS is never as effective with telephoto lenses, where many users will feel they need it most, and the viewfinder image isn’t stabilised either, so you get no feel for how well it’s working. ISO and Noise At low sensitivities, the 26MP sensor cleanly resolves plenty of fine detail, with barely any visible noise. Indeed it’s only at ISO 1600 that there’s any apparent loss of detail, even when examining files onscreen at the pixel level. By ISO 12,800 almost all fine detail has gone, but files should still be perfectly acceptable for many purposes. I’d count ISO 51,200 as the practical limit, which is still impressive for an APS-C camera. Anything beyond this is, to put it politely, sketchy; by ISO 204,800 the scene is drowned beneath a sea of noise, while the higher settings are simply awful.

      value: "What is the Canon EOS 77D? A couple of years ago, Canon added two similar models to its EOS line-up in the form of the EOS 750D and EOS 760D. At the time, we questioned \Lthe manufacturer’s rationale \Lbehind creating two cameras with near-identical specifications. Two years on, we’re presented with another pair of similar EOS models. The new EOS 800D replaces the EOS 750D and is targeted at newcomers to DSLRs, such as those stepping up from a basic compact or a smartphone. The EOS 77D on test here is the EOS 760D’s successor, and sets out to appeal to aspiring enthusiasts with greater photographic knowledge who are after sophisticated control. Canon EOS 77D – Features Just like the EOS 80D that’s positioned above it in Canon’s enthusiast line-up, the EOS 77D is equipped with a 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor. Although this sensor doesn’t offer a higher pixel count like the EOS 760D did over the older EOS 700D, it does support Canon’s Dual Pixel AF technology that promises considerably faster focus acquisition in live view. As well as this notable enhancement, the EOS 77D’s sensor pairs up with Canon’s most up-to-date DIGIC 7 image processor that’s claimed to process data 14x faster than the DIGIC 6 processor found within the EOS 750D/760D. This has resulted in the camera offering a higher maximum burst speed and superior buffer depth. Whereas the EOS 760D could shoot at up to 5fps for as many as 940 JPEGs or eight RAW files, the EOS 77D claims to be capable of recording an unlimited number of JPEGs at 6fps or 27 RAW files at the same speed. In addition to these speed benefits, the new sensor and processor pairing also allows the EOS 77D to shoot at a higher maximum native sensitivity setting of ISO 25,600 (along with the equivalent of ISO 51,200 in expanded mode). By comparison, the 750D/760D both offer a maximum native sensitivity setting of ISO 12,800, with the equivalent of ISO 25,600 available in its expanded mode. The EOS 77D’s new AF system is a far cry from the 19-point autofocus system that featured on the EOS 760D. The major revamp has seen it inherit the same 45-point all-cross-type AF system from the EOS 80D. Out of the 45 AF points on offer, 27 remain active when using a teleconverter and lens combination with a maximum aperture of f/8, whereas the centre point is sensitive down to f/2.8. The good news doesn’t end here. The working range of the AF system also spans wider than it did before, and operates across a -3EV to 18EV range. At this point, you might be wondering how the EOS 77D differs from the EOS 80D. Viewing the EOS 77D from above reveals that its top-plate LCD is smaller and more cramped. Turning to the rear, the pentamirror viewfinder, with its 95% coverage of the frame and 0.82x magnification, doesn’t quite trump the 100% frame coverage and 0.9x magnification of the EOS 80D’s pentaprism. Neither does its battery offer the same stamina. Whereas the EOS 80D can shoot 960 shots on a single charge, the EOS 77D’s smaller LP-E17 battery lasts for about 600 shots. There are other differences, \Ltoo, with the 80D shooting a continuous burst 1fps faster and presenting a higher maximum shutter speed (1/8000sec as opposed to the EOS 77D’s 1/4000sec). Below the EOS 77D’s viewfinder you get a 3in, 1.04-million-dot, vari-angle touchscreen, with metering left in the capable hands of Canon’s 7,560-pixel RGB IR metering sensor – yet another feature it inherits from the EOS 80D. The EOS 77D doesn’t feature 4K video, but provides videographers with the option of shooting Full HD (1920×1080) movies up to 60p in the MP4 format. By way of comparison, the highest video setting on the 760D is 1080p Full HD at 30fps. Even more impressive is the EOS 77D’s introduction of in-camera electronic image stabilisation. This is applicable only to movie recording and cannot be used for still-image capture, but it can be activated to ensure smoother video capture when shooting handheld. Just like the EOS 800D, the EOS 77D sports a 3.5mm microphone port in addition to the twin stereo microphones either side of the pop-up flash. However, you’ll want to look at the EOS 80D if a headphone socket to monitor \Laudio is a priority. To satisfy those who would like to control the camera wirelessly and share images via a mobile device, the EOS 77D is Wi-Fi and NFC equipped. The camera’s wireless connectivity teams up with Canon’s Camera Connect app that’s free to download via the App Store for iOS devices or Google Play for Android. In addition, the camera offers constant Bluetooth wireless control, which ties in with a new BR-E1 remote controller (£39) that can fire the shutter with no line of sight from 5m away. Canon EOS 77D – Build and design Whereas the EOS 800D falls into Canon’s DSLRs for beginners range, the EOS 77D positions itself in the manufacturer’s DSLRs for enthusiasts line-up. The overall build quality feels more or less in keeping with the EOS 80D, and the aluminium-alloy chassis and polycarbonate resin with\
        \ glass-fibre finish combine well to give it reassuringly strong \Lfeel in the hand. All the body panels are made to a high standard and there are no creaking noises when the body is held tightly in your right hand, as you occasionally get on some cheaper entry-level DSLRs. Although the EOS 77D is well constructed, it’s important to note that it’s similar to the EOS 800D in that it doesn’t offer weather sealing. If you know that you regularly shoot in inclement weather or want the extra peace of mind that comes with owning a camera with weather seals, the EOS 80D would be the more suitable mid-range option. Unlike the EOS 800D, which has a simplified layout of controls to enhance its appeal with first-time and novice DSLR users, the EOS 77D has a somewhat busier look to its body, with a greater number of buttons and dials. One of the key differences is the rotating thumb wheel at the rear, which takes the place of the EOS 800D’s four-way directional pad. This provides fast, independent control of aperture in manual mode – something that’s not as easy on the EOS 800D, which requires you to hold the AV/exposure-compensation button at the same time as using the single command dial on the top-plate. In addition, the rear thumb wheel on the EOS 77D doubles up as a quick way of adjusting exposure compensation in program, aperture-priority and shutter-priority modes. The only drawback from an operational perspective is that it’s like the dial you get on the EOS 760D – it’s rather small and doesn’t offer the same resistance as the rear dials on more expensive enthusiast DSLRs such as the EOS 7D Mark II. Although the EOS 77D’s handgrip isn’t the largest, it happily accommodates average-sized hands and lets you grip the body without feeling as if your little finger is about to drop off the end. The rubberised grip doesn’t wrap all the way around the side of the body so your palm does come into contact with plastic, and at the rear you get a comfortable thumb rest, which, as on the front of the grip, is rubberised. The AF-ON button, like the top-plate LCD panel, will appeal to more experienced users, and it can be used to separate autofocus activation from the shutter release, and perform back-button focusing, which isn’t possible on the EOS 800D. Canon has again carved out a small section of the body below the mode dial to accommodate the camera’s on/off switch. Centralising the switch turns the camera on, whereas flicking it all the way to the right engages video mode. This is different to the EOS 800D, which lets you to turn the camera on, control the shooting modes and drive it from your right hand, with the exception of the main menu and info buttons. Those familiar with the EOS 760D will notice that the EOS 77D inherits the eye sensor above the viewfinder. Its purpose is to turn off the info screen or electronic-level function when the camera is raised to the eye, to preserve battery life. You may also notice the presence of a lock switch, which isn’t on the EOS 800D, that prevents the EOS 77D’s rear scroll dial being accidentally adjusted. The rear screens on Canon’s latest DSLRs are well known for being excellent and the EOS 77D’s is no exception. There’s an indent just below the live view button that allows it to be pulled out from the body by 180°. From this position it offers 270° of rotation to aid low and high-angle shooting. It’s super-responsive to light touches and lets you navigate the main menu, quick menu and plethora of on-screen live view settings with no difficulty or fuss. This review was originally published on Trusted Reviews Canon EOS 77D – Autofocus The significant benefit you gain from choosing the EOS 77D ahead of the outgoing but still available EOS 760D is an enhanced focusing performance in live view mode and when you’re recording HD video. You no longer get any annoying stuttering as the camera attempts to acquire accurate focus in live view and you can employ continuous autofocus (AI servo), too – a feature that first appeared on the EOS 80D. While most users will use one-shot AF when photographing stationary subjects in live view, those who like to shoot moving subjects and want the camera to track its movement will select servo AF with the live tracking AF method. After testing, I found the camera’s tracking AF method works adequately for subjects that don’t move erratically, but I achieved more consistent results with fast-moving subjects by tracking the subject in the centre of the frame with the AF method set to zone AF. The EOS 77D’s spread of 45 autofocus points across the frame is also superior to the EOS 760D’s arrangement of 19 AF points. The AF points can be highlighted in the viewfinder or on the screen at any time using the AF point selection button on the shoulder of the body or by using the AF area button beside the ISO button on the top-plate. The layout is made up of three groups of 15 points, with the central group being spread slightly wider and higher than the\
        \ two groups either side. Just as with the EOS 800D, there is a sizeable gap around the edge of the frame that isn’t covered by any AF points and you don’t get the option to reduce the number of selectable points as you do on more advanced models such as the EOS 7D Mark II. This means that it’s not the fastest camera to use when it comes to shifting the AF point around the frame quickly. This point aside, the EOS 77D focused quickly and accurately with the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM kit zoom that was supplied with our review camera (available as part of a kit for £1199) as well as with more expensive L-series optics. Canon EOS 77D – Burst shooting Photographing a variety of subjects from fast cars to a game of cricket revealed that the EOS 77D rattles out JPEGs for as long as the shutter is depressed. Switching the file format to RAW saw the camera record 22 consecutive images to my 32GB Lexar Professional Class 10/U3 SDHC card – a few frames short of what Canon claims is possible, but still a significant improvement over the EOS 760D. Canon EOS 77D – Wi-Fi connectivity Once it’s set up, the connection process between camera and mobile devices using Wi-Fi is quick and easy, thanks to the dedicated connectivity button at the rear of the camera. The Camera Connect app provides all the options you need to take remote control from an iOS or Android device, and you get the option to down-sample images to a more friendly size for emailing and sharing, too. Canon EOS 77D – Performance Set to its default ‘standard’ picture style, you’ll get impressive results straight out of the camera, with rich colour and a high level of contrast. Users can experiment with the various picture styles, but if you’re after results that aren’t quite as vibrant, the neutral or faithful picture styles may be preferred. Metering from the 7560-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor produces consistent and accurate exposures in all but the most extreme high-contrast situations, resulting in evenly lit images that are neither too dark nor too bright. Likewise, automatic white balance can generally \Lbe relied upon to render accurate colour consistently. Canon EOS 77D – Dual Pixel AF Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology made its debut on the EOS 70D back in 2013. Since then, we’ve seen it introduced in no fewer than seven DSLRs, which include the EOS 80D and EOS 800D. In practical terms, the main benefit of Dual Pixel CMOS AF is that it greatly speeds up focus-acquisition times when the camera is being operated in live-view mode. The way it basically works is that each pixel on the sensor’s surface is split into two individual photodiodes – one left and one right. Each of these can be read separately, thereby allowing faster phase-detection autofocus while simultaneously being used for image capture. Prior to the introduction of Dual Pixel CMOS AF, Canon DSLRs relied on contrast-detect technology, which is typically slower and less accurate at locking on to targets than phase detection – noticeably so when attempting to focus on a moving subject. The EOS 77D sports the manufacturer’s fastest on-sensor phase-detection technology currently available, which includes support of Servo AF. This allows the user to select focus on a subject and track it through the frame, when all the while the shutter button is half depressed. It’s particularly effective for capturing sharp shots of moving subjects, and our best results were achieved when we switched the AF method from single-point AF to Zone AF. It’s great to see this technology trickling down to DSLRs at the EOS 77D and EOS 800D’s price point and you sense it’s only a matter of time before it reaches entry-level EOS models. Review: Canon EOS 800D Canon EOS 77D – Image Quality Resolution Whereas some of its rivals, such as the Nikon D5600 and Pentax KP, go without an anti-aliasing filter in an effort to resolve the finest detail, the EOS 77D holds on to an anti-aliasing filter. With this in place, it has its work cut out to achieve the same levels of resolution. At ISO 100, the sensor resolves a level of detail that we’d expect from an APS-C DSLR with an anti-aliasing filter. Our dynamic-range tests show an improvement on the 750D/760D, with the EOS 77D returning figures that are higher across the entire sensitivity range. Dynamic range Compared to the EOS 760D, which delivered a figure of 11.6EV at ISO 100, the EOS 77D produces a higher 12.5EV figure at its base sensitivity setting. The dynamic range is higher throughout the sensitivity range, although it can’t quite match the readout we recently recorded by the Pentax KP, which achieved figures above 10EV right up to ISO 3200. Beyond ISO 800, the EOS 77D’s dynamic range drops to 9.3EV at ISO 1600, 8.4EV at ISO 3200 and 7.5EV at ISO 6400. The 6EV figures that are recorded between ISO 12,800 and ISO 51,200 indicate that shadow detail becomes more heavily affected by noise beyond ISO 6400. Noise As with resolution, you’ll achieve better results by\
        \ processing raw files yourself than shooting in the JPEG format and relying on the in-camera JPEG processing to remove noise for you. Shoot in the raw format and you’ll notice that noise does start to make its presence known in files captured at ISO 800, but with vigilant application of noise reduction in post-processing, you can get usable results out of the camera at settings as high as ISO 3200 and ISO 6400. Should I buy the Canon EOS 77D? The Canon EOS 77D has a lot in common with the EOS 800D when it comes to its core specification. Study the pair side by side and their differences start to become more obvious. The rotating thumb wheel at the rear, dedicated AF-ON button, LCD screen on the top plate and automatic eye sensor are factors that suggest the EOS 77D will appeal to more advanced photographers who are possibly looking for finer control than you’d get from an entry-level model. That said, it’s well geared up for newcomers to a DSLR, too. Inside the menu you’ll find the same optional guided interface that you get on the EOS 800D, which, when activated, changes the shooting screen and menu display on the LCD to a more animated one that provides information and practical advice specific to the exposure mode selected. The information doesn’t go into any great detail, but should nonetheless prove useful to those users starting their DSLR journey. If you’re just starting out in the world of DSLR photography, you’ll feel at ease with the EOS 800D as soon as you get it out of the box. What you don’t want, though, is to regret your decision and wish you’d chosen the EOS 77D instead. If you’re undecided about which to buy, ask yourself these two questions: Am I a quick learner? Am I going to pursue photography regularly? If your answer is yes to both, the extra £50 you’ll pay for the EOS 77D will get you a camera that’ll serve you better in the long term. The EOS 77D is a capable DSLR for aspiring enthusiasts and those starting out. It’s more expensive than its main rivals, but offers a much-improved live-view performance over the EOS 760D it replaces, performs well in low light up to ISO 6400, and it operates intuitively, making it a very enjoyable camera to use."

      value: 'What is the Canon EOS 800D? Canon’s triple-digit EOS range has long been a popular option for those seeking either an upper entry-level or step-up DSLR. In recent years, Canon has muddied the waters somewhat by offering not just one triple-digit EOS model at a time but two. In 2015, this approach resulted in the launch of both the Canon 750D and the more advanced Canon 760D. Fast forward to 2017 and Canon has introduced two new models to succeed the 750D and 760D: the 800D and the 77D. The 800D serves as the successor to the 750D, while the 77D is intended as more of a 760D replacement that is positioned under the enthusiast-grade 80D. Also referred to as the Rebel T7i for the US market, the 800D shares the same key specs as the 77D, although in keeping with the 750D/760D differences outlined above, gets a simplified control scheme in order to enhance its appeal with first-time and novice DSLR users. Canon EOS 800D / T7i – Features The 800D is built around a 24.2-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor – as used inside the more advanced 80D (£840 body-only). While the 750D/760D also sported 24.2-megapixel sensors, neither encompasses Canon’s Dual Pixel AF technology, so while effective resolution remains identical to the 800D’s sensor, it represents a fairly big step forward. Likewise, the 800D also employs Canon’s latest generation DIGIC 7 image processor, as opposed to the DIGIC 6 chip found inside the 750D/760D. Canon claims that the DIGIC 7 is able to process data 14x faster than its predecessor, which not only enables the 800D to provide a higher maximum burst speed of 6fps (compared to 5fps on the 750D/760D), but also to fire off a higher number of consecutive images when burst shooting. In addition, the new sensor and processor pairing also allows the 800D to offer a higher maximum native sensitivity setting of ISO 25,600, along with the equivalent of ISO 51,200 in expanded mode. By way of comparison, the 750D/760D both offer a maximum native sensitivity setting of ISO 12,800, with the equivalent of ISO 25,600 available in expanded mode. Perhaps the most notable enhancement the 800D enjoys over its predecessors is the addition of Canon’s Dual Pixel AF technology. Introduced with the EOS 70D in 2013, Dual Pixel AF is the name given to Canon’s proprietary on-sensor phase-detection technology. In practical terms the main benefit of Dual Pixel AF is that it greatly speeds up focus acquisition times when the camera is being operated in Live View. The way it works is that each pixel on the sensor’s surface is split into two individual photodiodes – one left and one right. Each of these can be read separately, thereby allowing them to be used for phase-detection AF purposes. Prior to the introduction of Dual Pixel AF, Canon DSLRs relied on contrast-detect technology and were renowned for providing fairly sluggish AF performance. The move to Dual Pixel AF therefore represents a big step up in terms of performance. Indeed, Canon claims that its latest iteration of Dual Pixel AF is the fastest on-sensor phase-detection technology currently available to DSLR users. Until now, the technology has been confined to models higher up in Canon’s DSLR range – the 80D and 7D Mark II (£1250 body only), for example. This is the first time the technology has trickled down to Canon’s mid-range models. In addition, the 800D’s viewfinder-based phase-detection AF system has also seen a major revamp and now employs 45 individual AF points across the viewfinder, all of which are of the cross-type variety. This is a notable improvement from the 19-point system employed by the 750D/760D. In terms of exposure modes, the 800D is well served by a generous range of options including the standard PASM quartet for more experienced users, alongside Scene Intelligent Auto mode and 10 individual Scene modes (some of which can be selected directly from the Exposure mode dial) for point-and-shoot duties. Those wanting to get creative in-camera can take advantage of ten built-in digital filters (including old favourites such as Toy Camera, Miniature effect and a trio of HDR options), or choose one of nine Creative Auto settings, each of which is designed to capture images with a unique ambience. JPEG processing options extend to Canon’s proprietary Picture Styles, of which there are eight presets and three User Defined slots to customise as you wish. In addition, the 800D also provides a range of in-camera lens-correction tools for minimising unsightly effects such as purple fringing and distortion, alongside the company’s longstanding Auto Lighting Optimizer tool to auto-correct image brightness and contrast. Canon EOS 800D – Build and design As with previous triple-digit Canon DSLR models, the 800D is a compact, lightweight and neatly styled DSLR. While it does feel a little plasticky (a common trait of entry-level Canon DSLRs over the years), overall build quality is actually pretty much on par for a camera of this price and specification.
        Inside the polycarbonate outer shell, the internal electronics of the 800D are protected by an aluminium alloy chassis. This should provide ample protection against the kind of gentle knocks and accidental scrapes most cameras experience at some point in their lifetime. However, unlike models further up the EOS range, the 800D’s body isn’t weather sealed – so you’ll need to keep it as dry as possible when shooting in wet weather. For a DSLR of such modest overall proportions, we found the 800D’s handgrip to be surprisingly deep and pronounced. With our averagely sized hands we were comfortably able to wrap three fingers around it, while the contoured thumb grip on the back of the body offers something to brace your thumb against for a secure grip. With the new EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II lens attached, the 800D feels exceptionally well balanced too. The camera’s physical buttons and controls are all clearly labelled, well spaced and have a reassuringly responsive ‘clicky’ feel about them when pressed. This review was originally posted on Trusted Reviews Canon EOS 800D – Viewfinder and screen The 800D’s optical viewfinder employs a pentamirror design that provides 95% scene coverage at 0.82x magnification – exactly the same as the 750D/760D. The viewfinder itself isn’t overly large but it does provide a pin-sharp view through the lens. Below the main viewfinder window, the 800D displays a range of key settings including shutter speed, aperture, ISO and a metering/exposure compensation bar. Below the viewfinder, the 800D’s 3-inch, 1040k-dot vari-angle touchscreen LCD panel is also carried over from the 750D/760D models. The Clear View II TFT screen is of very good quality and displays captured images with great clarity, showing vivid colours and good levels of contrast while the camera is being used in Playback mode. The touchscreen is nice and responsive, too, never missing a beat when it comes to inputting commands through the screen with your fingers. As with previous models, the screen is side-hinged to allow it to be extracted fully 180 degrees from the camera body, from where it also rotates through 270 degrees. This enables the screen to be positioned so that it faces the rear of the camera for regular shooting as well as the front for self-portraits and suchlike. Naturally, you can also rotate the screen to accommodate overhead and hip-level shooting. One small improvement the 800D does enjoy over the 750D/760D is the addition of an electronic level that can be used to get perfectly straight horizons when using a tripod. This is activated via the Info button that sits just to the left of the viewfinder. Canon EOS 800D – Autofocus While the introduction of Canon’s Dual Pixel AF technology represents a significant step forward for those who like to work in Live View mode, the D800’s viewfinder-based phase-detection AF system also sees notable improvement from previous triple-digit EOS models. More specifically, whereas the 750D/760D both used 19 cross-type AF points, the 800D inherits the same AF system used inside the 80D, which benefits from 45 cross-type AF points across the central portion of the viewfinder. While there’s still a sizeable gap around the edges that isn’t covered, focusing remains speedy and precise, with a working range of -3 to 18EV at ISO 100. Switching to the 49-point Dual Pixel AF Live View system, the working range drops slightly from -2EV to 18EV. Either way, that’s still pretty good and enables the camera to attain focus even in dim conditions. My only minor gripe is that the new 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens can be quite noisy while focus is being adjusted. If you’re shooting video in a quiet environment then you can expect the 800D’s built-in microphones to pick up on this. When used in Live View mode you can set the active AF point via the rear touchscreen, simply by tapping on the subject on which you want to focus. Canon also provides a Touch Shutter function that takes things one step further by automatically capturing an image once the camera has attained focus on the chosen subject. Servo AF is also available in Live View mode for shooting moving subjects alongside One Shot AF for stationary subjects. Canon EOS 800D T7i – Performance The addition of the newer DIGIC 7 image processor certainly makes a difference as far as burst shooting performance goes. With a 16GB SanDisk Extreme Pro Class 10/U3 SDHC card inserted into the camera, I was able to record approximately 25 consecutive Raw images at the maximum 6fps with AF-S employed. By way of comparison, the 750D could manage only eight frames at 5fps before slowing down. Switching to Raw+JPEG capture, the number drops to around 22 images. In JPEG capture there appears to be no upper limit, aside from the size of your memory card and the amount of battery charge remaining of course. JPEG image quality is, as we’ve come to expect from Canon DSLRs, very good indeed. Even with the camera set to its “Standard” Picture Style
        setting, colours are deep and vivid, with good levels of contrast. Of course, if you want to boost saturation then there’s a “Vivid” Picture Style to choose from, whereas if you’re looking for something flatter, the “Neutral” option will give you precisely this. Matrix metering from the 7560-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor proves consistently accurate in all but the most extreme high-contrast situations, resulting in evenly lit images that are neither too dark nor too bright. Likewise, Automatic White Balance also serves up consistently accurate colour. Canon EOS 800D – Guided User Interface Another new feature for the 800D is the addition of a Guided User Interface. This is a purely optional feature that can be accessed and switched on/off via the Display Level tab in the main in-camera menu. Once the Guided UI is activated, the rear LCD panel will change from a standard display of key camera settings to a more animated one that also provides some basic information and practical advice specific to the exposure mode selected. For example, with  aperture priority mode selected, the rear LCD shows an intuitive slider graphic that displays whereabouts in the aperture range the aperture is currently set to, along with a brief description of what kind of photo the chosen aperture value would best suit – and with how much it will blur or bring into focus the background behind the main subject. The information and advice supplied by the GUI doesn’t go into any great detail, but should nonetheless prove useful to those users just starting out with a DSLR who may be unsure of how changing key camera settings will affect their images, and on that level it’s certainly a welcome addition. In addition to using the Guided UI for shooting duties, it can also be applied to the in-camera menu. Here it essentially just simplifies the standard in-camera menu, by grouping all four sub-menu tabs – Shooting, Playback, Function and Display Level – together on a single introductory screen, with a brief description of what you can expect to find within each. Canon EOS 800D – Video While it may come as a surprise to some that Canon has decided against the inclusion of 4K video capture, this is something that all other entry-level or step-up DSLRs on the market have yet to offer. This includes all of the 800D’s nearest rivals, including the Nikon D5500/D5600, Sony A68 and Pentax K-70, all of which are limited to 1080p Full HD capture. That said, Canon has improved the video capabilities of the 800D over the 750D/760D, bringing it into line with both the 77D and the 80D via the inclusion of 1080p Full HD video recording at 60fps. The highest video setting on the 750D/760D was 1080p Full HD at 30fps. Even more impressive is the 800D’s introduction of in-camera image stabilisation. This is only applicable to video recording and can’t be used for still image capture, but it can be activated to ensure smoother video capture when shooting handheld. There are three settings to choose from: Off, Regular IS and Enhanced IS. The Regular setting can be used to counter basic handshake, while the latter is intended for use in more extreme circumstances. Either way, the difference is clear to see, not just in recorded footage but also in the rear LCD panel while recording is in progress. As with previous triple-digit models, the 800D also sports a dedicated microphone jack in addition to the twin stereo microphones on the front of the camera body. Canon EOS 800D – Image Quality Overall, the 800D produced a solid set of test results. Resolution was the clear standout, with the sensor returning an excellent set of images despite Canon’s decision to retain an optical low-pass filter. While JPEGs returned decent enough results, I found that using Adobe Camera Raw to sharpen raw images ourselves yielded better results. Dynamic range has been improved from the two-year-old 750D/760D models, too, with the 800D returning slightly higher figures than its predecessors across the camera’s sensitivity range. Resolution Dynamic range At ISO 100, the 800D returned a dynamic range of 12.5EV, which is nearly a full stop higher than the 750D’s figure of 11.6EV and almost identical to the 80D’s 12.6EV. It performs well against the Pentax K-70 (12.3EV) and Sony A68 (11.9EV), although the Nikon D5500 produces the best results of all with a maximum dynamic range (at ISO 100) of 13.3EV. Moving up through its ISO range the 800D remains a strong performer, with figures of 11.7EV at ISO 200, 11.3EV at ISO 400 and 10.4EV at ISO 800. Beyond this figures start to drop off, with 8.5EV available at ISO 3200 and 7.4EV at ISO 6400. Noise As with resolution, our testing revealed quite a difference between in-camera JPEGs and manually processed raw images. Raw was again the clear winner, with manually processed images showing noticeable gains in image quality over in-camera JPEG processing. While JPEGs do display very low levels of noise all the way up to ISO 3200, the effects
        of in-camera noise reduction led to a noticeable loss of fine detail. While this isn’t quite so apparent at ISO 100 and ISO 200, by ISO 400 the effects of in-camera noise control begin to produce a smearing of fine detail. With careful raw processing, however, it’s possible to retain this fine detail. That said, for most users, the overall image quality of JPEGs remains pretty good and is eminently usable until about ISO 6400. Should I buy the the Canon EOS 800D? Canon has a long history of producing excellent upper entry-level DSLRs through its triple-digit EOS range, and the 800D is no exception. While the differences between the 800D and 77D are primarily limited to how advanced the two camera’s control schemes are, the differences between the 800D and its two-year-old predecessors – the EOS 750D and 760D – are more pronounced. Far from being limited to a new sensor and image processor, the 800D also sees notable improvements in several other key areas. This is especially true of its focusing systems, both through the viewfinder and especially when using Live View. While the 800D provides a good range of features and is capable of excellent image quality, it’s by no means the cheapest upper entry-level DSLR on the market. That said, it’s easily able to match all of its main rivals, and even surpasses them in certain areas such as video capture and Live View AF performance. My only minor gripe is that build quality can feel a little plastic next to more expensive DSLRs, which poses some question marks over its longevity. Unlike the Pentax K-70, the 800D also lacks weather-sealing. Overall, though, the 800D / T7i provides an excellent gateway to Canon’s extensive range of DSLR lenses, and could be used as the starting point to build up a collection of specialist optics. For many newcomers to DSLR photography, this is likely to be a major selling point.'

    - type: excerpt
      value: What is the Nikon D5600? The Nikon D5600 is a direct replacement for the two-year-old Nikon D5500 that has now been discontinued. The new model is primarily targeted at photography enthusiasts looking to buy their first DSLR and who have a little more money to spend, along with existing owners of older entry-level Nikon DSLRs looking to upgrade. Nikon D5600 – Features In terms of its headline specifications, the D5600 is almost identical to the D5500 it replaces. That said, the newer model does benefit from a few useful new features. Chief among these is the addition of Nikon’s proprietary SnapBridge technology that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tech for wireless image-transfer duties between the camera and a connected smartphone or tablet. A timelapse mode has also been added, and the D5600 comes with a brand-new kit lens in the shape of the Nikon AF-P DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR. This employs a retractable design for added compactness and comes with Nikon’s Vibration Reduction (VR) image-stabilisation technology built in. Unlike the AF-S DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II that came with the D5500, there is no VR on/off switch located on the lens itself – you’ll need to use the in-camera menu instead. Neither is there an MF/AF switch, although manual override is available by default. Aside from these subtle additions, there isn’t a great deal of difference between the D5600 and its predecessor. In keeping with the D5500, the D5600 is fitted with a 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor. This provides ample resolution for larger prints, along with a generous degree of image-cropping flexibility. As with previous models, the sensor forgoes an optical low-pass filter in order to maximise sharpness and fine detail, and the D5600 also employs the same Nikon EXPEED 4 image processor that was used in the D5500. Shutter speeds range from 30-1/4000sec, while sensitivity ranges from ISO 100-25,600. Still-image capture options extend to large (24MP), medium (13.5MP) and small (6MP) JPEGs processed in-camera, while those looking for more versatility in post-production can choose between 12-bit and 14-bit lossless raw. Video capture is possible at 1080p Full HD or 720p HD at up to 60fps, and the D5600 also sports a dedicated microphone jack, although there’s no headphone jack. The main addition to the D5600 is undoubtedly SnapBridge, which uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to establish an always-on connection to a smartphone or tablet. It’s designed to automatically transfer all captured images from the D5600 to your device for sharing, but you can choose to manually transfer specific ones yourself. They can be transferred at their original size, or limited to 2MB per image in order to save memory. The main benefit of SnapBridge is that Bluetooth consumes less power than Wi-Fi, thereby extending the camera’s battery life. You’ll need to install the SnapBridge app on your phone first, which is free to both Android iOS users. Unlike the cheaper D3400, which only uses Bluetooth connectivity, the D5600 also includes Wi-Fi. This allows you to use SnapBridge as a remote control for your camera, complete with a live view feed. You can select a point of focus by tapping the viewfinder on your smartphone’s screen, but you can’t change any key camera settings remotely via the SnapBridge app. This feels rather primitive in contrast to other manufacturers’ systems, which all let you change shutter speed, aperture, ISO and so on directly from your smartphone. Nikon D5600 – Build and design The D5600 is one of the smallest and lightest DSLRs on the market. It’s even slightly smaller than the cheaper Nikon D3400 . While overall build quality obviously isn’t in the same league as more expensive Nikon DSLRs, its polycarbonate shell feels robust enough to soak up the odd minor knock. It isn’t weather-proofed so you’ll want to take care when using it in the wet. Despite its relatively small size, the D5600 offers a deep finger grip that, combined with the ridged thumb rest on the back, offers a reassuringly secure grip. Overall, it feels nicely balanced in the hand and handles very well. General operation is quick and efficient thanks primarily to the camera’s large display and responsive touchscreen. My only minor gripe is that it’s easy to move the active AF point inadvertently with your nose when holding the camera at eye level, but the touchscreen can be turned off if you find this a problem. Buttons and controls are generously spaced and clearly labelled, although unlike all its main rivals, the D5600 lacks any buttons that provide direct access to commonly used settings such as ISO, AF mode and white balance. If you want to change any of these, by far the quickest way is to press the ‘i’ button, which takes you to a streamlined settings interface, from where you can access and change the most commonly used controls using the touchscreen. Nikon D5600 – Performance The D5600 is equipped with a slightly larger-than-average 3.2-inch rear
        display – all its main rivals sport 3-inch monitors. This is of the side-hinged, vari-angle design that allows you to position the screen at just about any angle you can think of, as well as fold it in towards the camera for added protection. Above the display the D5600’s optical viewfinder provides a bright and clear view of 95% of the frame, with key shooting information displayed directly below. Autofocus is taken care of via Nikon’s Multi-CAM 4800DX module and employs 39 individual AF points, including a block of nine cross-type AF points in the centre. This works extremely well and is certainly a step up from the 11-point AF system of the cheaper D3400, delivering speedy and accurate phase-detection autofocus through the viewfinder. While the D5600’s live view AF isn’t as lightning-fast as the Dual Pixel AF technology that underpins the Canon EOS 800D, it’s not far behind and still impressively quick. The new 15-55mm AF-P kit lens is also silent when focusing, which means there’s no sound to be picked up when shooting video. With its maximum burst speed of 5fps, continuous shooting isn’t a key strength of the D5600. In fact, all its rivals can shoot slightly faster, even if it’s only by an extra frame in the case of the Canon EOS 800D and Pentax K-70. Perhaps more tellingly, the D5600 also falls behind the competition when it comes to how many consecutive frames can be captured before the frame rate drops below 5fps. With a 16GB SanDisk Extreme Pro Class 10/U3 SDHC card inserted, I was only able to record 10 consecutive raw images at 5fps, while for raw+JPEG the figure dropped to just five frames. By way of comparison, the Canon EOS 800D can shoot 25 consecutive raw files and around 22 raw+JPEG. Nikon definitely needs to catch up here with its next revision. Nikon D5600 – Image quality Resolution JPEGs shot at ISO 100 return a figure of 3300l/ph, while their manually processed raw counterparts are capable of resolving almost 3700l/ph. For JPEGs, resolution remains at or above 3000l/ph until a credible ISO 1600, although it’s possible to eke out 3000l/ph or more from raw files right up to ISO 6400. Dynamic Range At lower sensitivity settings, results hover 0.5EV to 1EV ahead of the D5600’s main rivals. Dynamic range remains above 12EV until ISO 800, where it drops to 11.1EV. The trade-off for low-sensitivity dynamic-range performance appears to come at the cost of high ISO dynamic-range performance, though, which generally lags behind that of its competitors. Noise At lower sensitivities there’s little difference between JPEGs and manually processed raw files in terms of detail and sharpness. By ISO 800, the effects of in-camera JPEG noise-reduction smoothing leads to the loss of some detail, whereas this can be retained with raw files. This is even more apparent at ISO 1600, where JPEGs display a marked loss of fine detail. Should I buy the Nikon D5600? While the D5600 doesn’t redefine what can be expected from an upper entry-level DSLR, it nonetheless builds upon the firm foundations of previous models in the line to deliver a good range of features, intuitive handling, decent performance and very good image quality at a highly competitive price. Image quality is very good indeed, with punchy JPEGs featuring accurate colours. If I have one small criticism it’s that the metering tends to prioritise highlights over shadows, which can lead to slightly dark-looking JPEGs when shooting in bright sunlight. In all other respects, though, image quality is very good, with higher-sensitivity performance being a notable strength. It’s possible to get good results right up to ISO 6400 – especially if you’re prepared to put in a bit of time in Adobe Lightroom.

      value: Michael Topham tests the charming Fujifilm X100V through its paces to find out if it's one of the best fixed lens compacts
    - type: conclusion
      value: 'It’s clear that Fujifilm has a good thing going with its X100-series. We’ve seen it evolve a long way in the space of ten years and the X100V continues to preserve the iconic design and classic styling that X100-series cameras have become known and loved for. With the X100V, Fujifilm hasn’t updated it by simply adding their latest X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and fastest processor. They’ve advanced it to the nth degree and created a better tool for photographers who like the simplicity that comes with working with a fixed lens compact and others who’d like a beautifully designed camera that conveniently fits a jacket pocket, which can be pulled out in a moments notice to capture truly stunning images. The X100V improves in many crucial areas, not least its lens, which contributes to much sharper, crisper images when shooting close subjects at wide apertures. Then there’s the autofocus system, which is snappier in operation and covers a wider area of the frame. The ability to record 4K video, albeit up to 10 minutes in length and without being able to employ the ND filter, is good to have too and the new tilting screen is so thin it allows users who’d like to shoot inconspicuously from the hip to do so without adding any extra bulk to the body. There will be some who’d prefer it if it was weather sealed out of the box or supplied with the weather resistant kit at no extra cost, but this is a minor gripe on what is otherwise a very robust and extremely well finished camera. The removal of the four-way buttons at the rear is my only real criticism, which I’d like to have seen preserved like they are on Fujifilm’s X-T3 and X-T4. Though I accept the touchscreen can be swiped to access different functions, this isn’t the same in my opinion to having physical buttons below your thumb that you can quickly and easily access with your right hand. To conclude, the X100V is a gorgeous little camera that’s as satisfying to look at as it is to shoot with. It has a special thing going for it in the way it inspires you to venture out and take pictures, which I put down to how easy it is to carry and the great images it creates straight off the bat. Anyone who buys the X100V can’t fail to fall in love with it. Fujifilm X100V: Hands on First Look Fujifilm X100V: At a glance Hot on the heels of its latest entry-level mirrorless release, the X-T200, Fujifilm has unveiled its fifth model in its iconic and stylish X100 series. The all-new Fujifilm X100V replaces the Fujifilm X100F from 2017 and introduces a number of improvements to make it the most advanced premium fixed lens compact in Fujifilm’s history. Top of the list of new and improved features are a redesigned 23mm F2.0 fixed lens, a two-way tilting screen and advanced weather resistance – things we’re told Fujifilm has received many requests for from existing X100 users. We recently laid hands on the X100V at Fujifilm’s X-Summit 2020 live broadcast in London where we got a chance to study it in detail and form some early impressions. Fujifilm X100V: Features The X100V is the latest X-series camera to inherit Fujifilm’s 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 APS-C sensor and quad-core X-Processor 4, which are used in the X-T3 , X-Pro3 and X-T30 . Together they deliver a sensitivity range of ISO 160-12,800 (extendable to ISO 80-51,200), along with continuous shooting rates of 11fps with the mechanical shutter, 20fps with the electronic shutter, or 30fps with a 1.25x crop. To compliment the X100V’s sensor, Fujifilm has designed a new 23mm F2.0 lens for the X100V that promises better resolution, lower distortion and improved performance in the corners and at close focus distances. The good news is that the improvements to the optics have had no influence on the size of the lens, meaning it remains fully compatible with existing adapters and legacy conversion lenses. Photographers can use the wide conversion lens (WCL-X100 II) or tele-conversion lens (TCL-X100 II) to extend the X100V’s fixed 23mm focal length (equivalent to 34.5mm in 35mm terms) to a 28mm equivalent (0.8x) or 50mm (1.4x) equivalent lens. In addition to weather sealing around the body and viewfinder, Fujifilm has designed a weather resistance kit for the X100V (£99) to enhance its operability in poor weather. The adapter ring (AR-X100) and protection filter (PRF-49) make the X100V fully weather resistant and for UK customers this kit will be sold at half price (£49.50) when purchased with the camera. Like its predecessors, the X100V features a hybrid optical/electronic viewfinder. In its optical mode, the finder continues to provide parallax-corrected frame lines, along with detailed overlaid exposure information, but now offers wider 95% coverage and a higher 0.52x magnification. As for the EVF, this has been upgraded to offer a clearer viewing experience with a 3.69-million-dot resolution, 0.66x magnification and improved contrast and brightness. The X100V’s autofocus performance goes one better too. It can now focus down
        to -5EV in low light and spreads no fewer than 2.16-million phase-detection pixels across the surface of its sensor. Users can select from 117 AF points laid out in a 9×13 formation, which can be increased to a 425-point layout consisting a 17×25 grid. Furthermore, the X100V provides enhanced face and eye detection and is equipped with Fujifilm’s focus limiter function that can be used to set the lens to a specific range of distances, which can be useful when the distance to the subject photographed remains consistent and fast focus is required. Other new additions include built-in 4-stop ND filter, which improves on the X100F’s built-in 3-stop ND filter, and a wider selection of film simulation modes. These include the Classic Negative mode that made its debut in the Fujifilm X-Pro3. Videographers benefit from having the ability to record 4K video at 30p or Full HD at up to 120fps. Those who’d like to record in 10-bit, 4:2:2 can do so via the X100V’s HDMI port, it has a 2.5mm microphone input at the side, and film simulation modes, such as Eterna, can be applied to video footage. Another welcome improvement is the X100V’s improved battery life. This lasts for 350 frames when using the EVF, or 420 frames using the optical viewfinder (OVF). With a USB Type-C port at the side, users have the option to charge on the go, and just as you’d expect, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is built-in to enable wireless transferring and remote control with devices running Fujifilm’s Camera Remote app. Fujifilm X100V: Build & Handling The X100V shares the same charm and elegance with its predecessors, however there are quite a few differences that aren’t immediately obvious. With regard to its build quality, the top and bottom plates are now manufactured from single pieces of aluminium, resulting in a much cleaner and crisper finish around the edge of the body than previous versions. The aluminium covers, which are built around a magnesium alloy frame to uphold a high level of robustness, are also exquisitely finished in a satin coating, with the all black version being anodised rather than painted to give what Fujifilm calls a ‘deeper black finish’. On the top plate, the X100V, like the X100F, benefits from an ISO dial that’s built around the shutter speed dial. It’s rather similar to the arrangement you’ll find on Fujifilm’s X-Pro3 in that the outer portion of the dial is lifted to adjust the ISO value, but it’s also vastly improved in the way it doesn’t have to be lifted and rotated simultaneously. Pull the outer ring up and the ISO dial can be rotated freely with your thumb before it’s pushed back down to lock it in place. It’s a much-improved design that we can see other X-series models benefiting from in the future. At the rear of the camera some further changes have been made. The most significant is the new two-way tilting 3in, 1.62-million-dot touchscreen that replaces the fixed screen of old. By designing the screen unit incredibly thinly, users get the benefit of a tilt screen with no additional bulk – indeed you wouldn’t really know it’s a tilt screen if it wasn’t for the cut-out at the bottom corner of the body that makes it easier to pull out. Touchscreen control extends to the quick menu, however the X100V doesn’t support navigation of the main menu by touch like we’ve recently seen on Fujifilm’s entry-level X-A7 and X-T200 mirrorless cameras. The other change at the rear is the absence of a four-way controller. Instead users are encouraged to use the joystick and the Menu/OK, playback and DISP/Back buttons that are aligned beneath. A quick menu button remains, but this has been shifted to the right a little to prevent accidental thumb presses. Though the thumb grip is said to have been refined, the feel of the X100V in the hand when you’re shooting is almost identical to its predecessor, the X100F. Fujifilm X100V: First Impressions It’s clear that with the X100V, Fujifilm has listened carefully to what existing X100 users have had to say and responded by making a series of valuable improvements to key areas of its operation and design. If the examples we were shown of how the new lens resolves sharpness is anything to go by, we can expect the X100V to produce far better image quality in the corners, plus with the addition of weather resistance, photographers will no longer be afraid of using it, or feel forced to switch to a different camera when the weather conditions takes a turn for the worse. Adding a tilt screen will be of huge benefit to street photographers who like to shoot inconspicuously from the hip and other tweaks such as improving the hybrid viewfinder, refining ISO control from the top plate and giving it an even more premium finish are likely to allure existing X100 users into thinking about an upgrade. We instantly fell in love with the X100V in the short time we used it and can’t wait to test it and put it through its paces in a few weeks time when we receive our review sample. Fujifilm X100V: Availability
        and pricing The X100V, which will be made in black and silver will cost £1299 when it goes on sale. The silver version will be available first and is expected to hit the shelves and online retailers from the 27th February. The black version of the X100V is expected to follow a little later and be available from the 12 th March. The X100V weather resistance kit, which includes an adapter ring (AR-X100) and filter (PRF-49), will cost an additional £99, however it’ll be sold at half price (£49.50) in the UK when it’s purchased at the same time as the camera. An optional premium leather case (LC-X100V) will also be available for the X100V, which has been designed to compliment the classic design, whilst providing access to the camera’s battery and memory card compartment. The black case will cost £79.'

      value: 'Fujifilm X100V Review: Introduction The rise of the smartphone and the convenience of being able to pull a slimline device from our pocket to take a photograph has had a huge knock-on effect of sales of compact cameras over the last decade. Despite demand not being the same as it once was, Canon, Fujifilm , Ricoh, Panasonic, Sony and Leica continue to make compact cameras. For more options have a look at our Best Compact Cameras . Many of the brands mentioned above have decided to focus their attention on the ‘premium’ type of compact, which are known for offering large sensors, superb electronic viewfinders and fast, high-quality lenses. Fujifilm’s popular X100-series has gained an excellent reputation with street and travel photographers. The combination of classic design, fast fixed lens, large APS-C sensor and hybrid viewfinder has been the recipe for success. With the fifth member in the X100-series, Fujifilm has continued to find ways to improve it by listening carefully to those who use it day in, day out. But does the X100V still appeal and justify a four-figure price tag from new? It’s time to find out… To find out what it’s like to own and use the Fujifilm X100V have a look at our Fujifilm X100V Field Test. Fujifilm X100V Review: Features You could be mistaken for thinking not a lot has changed when you view the X100V directly from the front. While it remains similar in soul to the original X100 and X100S , X100T and X100F that have followed, the X100V has changed in lots of different ways. Indeed, there’s so much new to report it’s difficult to know where to start. Rather than inheriting the same lens from the X100F , Fujifilm has reconfigured it. The configuration of 8 elements in 6 groups remains unchanged, but the lens now unites a pair of aspherical elements in its construction whereas previous generations have had just one. The 23mm fixed focal length (equivalent to 35mm) and aperture range (f/2 to f/16) is the same and it upholds a minimum focusing distance of 10cm. Fujifilm alleges the newly added aspherical element results in better edge-to-edge sharpness, lower distortion and improved performance at close focus distances – something I’ll touch on in more detail later in this review. The good news for those who own existing adapters or legacy conversion lenses is that the dimensions of the lens are identical to existing models, meaning they’re fully compatible. Keeping on the subject of the lens, users have the option to unscrew a ring at the front and attach Fujifilm’s wide conversion lens (WCL-X100 II) or tele-conversion lens (TCL-X100 II), turning the X100V’s 23mm lens into a 28mm equivalent (0.8x) or 50mm (1.4x) equivalent. It’s important to acknowledge that Fujifilm’s first-generation conversion lenses remain compatible. Unlike the second-generation versions though these aren’t automatically detected by the X100V when they’re attached and require you to manually select tele or wide from the conversion lens option in the menu or from a function button to which it can be set. Behind the X100V’s lens lies the same sensor and processor combination as found inside Fujifilm’s latest premium X-series mirrorless models. The back-illuminated 26.1-million-pixel X-Trans CMOS 4 APS-C sensor and quad-core X-Processor 4 bring a number of benefits to the X100V, including a wider sensitivity range of ISO 160-12,800 (extendable to ISO 80-51,200), along with continuous shooting rates of up to 11fps with the mechanical shutter, 20fps with the electronic shutter, or 30fps with a 1.25x crop. Although such fast shooting speeds aren’t a prerequisite of street, travel or documentary users to whom the X100V is most likely to appeal, it’s great to see Fujifilm’s latest generation X-Trans CMOS 4 technology being used for the first time inside an X100-series model. The X100V’s autofocus has been improved too. Like Fujifilm’s latest premium X-T and X-Pro models, the X100V spreads 2.16-million phase-detection pixels across the surface of its sensor and obtains focus as hastily as 0.02sec. As well as being able to acquire focus in light levels as low as -5EV, users get to choose from 117 AF points arranged in a 9×13 formation across the frame, or increase this to a 425-point layout (17×25 grid) for more precise positioning. The X100V is also equipped with face and eye detection, AF-C custom settings and Fujifilm’s AF range limiter function. The latter is used to tell the lens to focus across a specific range of distances. This can be useful when the distance to the subject you’re photographing remains consistent and you’d like to eliminate the lens focusing across a wider AF range than necessary. As we’ve seen on other X-Series models, the X100V’s mechanical focal plane shutter has a 1/4000sec limit. By activating the electronic shutter there’s the option to shoot at up to 1/32,000sec, which can be particularly useful when you’d like to work with wide apertures in bright conditions. Helpfully, the X100V
        has its own 4-stop ND filter built-in too, which goes one better than the 3-stop ND filter offered on the X100F. Adding to its long list of new features is a monochromatic color mode that gives users precise control over how warm or cool images appear. Eterna and Classic Negative film simulations are added too and every film simulation is available when shooting video. Those who enjoy recording video can shoot 4K footage at 30p/25p/24p with a bit rate of 200Mbps for up to ten minutes. Full HD video at up to 120fps is available for a maximum record time of fifteen minutes. Anyone wishing to record in 10-bit, 4:2:2 can do so via the X100V’s HDMI port and it’s good to see face/eye detection being supported in video mode. At the side, the X100V is equipped with a 2.5mm mic input, USB Type C port and HDMI (Type D) micro connector. Like the X100F, the X100V accepts Fujifilm’s widely used NP-W126S battery. Shooting stamina is upped to 350 frames using the EVF, or 420 shots using the optical viewfinder. In-camera charging via USB is supported and a USB cable (type A to C) comes supplied in the box. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth feature too, enabling wireless transfer and wireless remote control. Both require Fujifilm’s Camera Remote app to be installed on iOS and Android mobile devices. Fujifilm X100V Review: Weather resistance One of the criticisms X100-series models have received in the past is their lack of weather resistance. Fujifilm has acknowledged that many photographers want to have the option of shooting with the X100V when the weather takes a turn for the worse and not be succumbed to stowing it away in a pocket or bag to prevent unfavourable weather affecting its performance. As well as adding weather resistance around the body and to the viewfinder to ensure the X100V is more durable, Fujifilm has released an optional weather-resistant kit that consists of an AR-X100 adapter ring and PRF-49 protection filter. By attaching the adapter ring and filter, the lens, which is prone to extending and retracting very slightly when focusing, becomes sealed and resistant to ingress of water, moisture, dust and sand. The weather resistant kit costs $123 / £99 and is available in both black and silver to match the colour of the two finishes the X100V is available in. Used versions of the weather resistant kit can also be found online from $98 / £79. Fujifilm X100V Review: Build and Handling I’d go as far as saying the X100V has received the biggest shake up in terms of its build and handling in the history of the X100-series. On close examination you’ll notice the finish to the edge of the body is sharper, which has been achieved by manufacturing the top and bottom plates from single pieces of aluminium. The aluminium covers that are built around a magnesium alloy frame to uphold a high level of robustness, are also exquisitely finished in a satin coating, with the all black version being anodised rather than painted to give it a deep black finish. One of the changes at the rear has seen the four-way buttons removed, with the drive dial being relocated to where the view mode button was on the X100F. This change forces users to nudge the joystick when navigating the menu and means there aren’t any buttons beneath your thumb for quick access to customised functions. Shifting the Q-menu button to the right a little has helped prevent accidental presses, however it is a bit too small and there were times when it felt like I was searching for it with the viewfinder raised to my eye. The rear dial, like the front dial, benefits from a better-knurled finish and both can be depressed to activate user-defined functions. Like the X100F , the X100V features an ISO dial that’s built around the shutter speed dial on the top plate. To address criticisms that it was a bit too fiddly on the X100F, Fujifilm has redesigned it. It’s similar to the arrangement you’ll find on the X100F in the way the outer portion of the dial is lifted to adjust the ISO value, but it’s also vastly improved in that it no longer requires you to lift it and rotate it simultaneously. Pull the outer ring up and the ISO dial can be rotated freely with your thumb before it’s pushed back down to lock it in place. Users who’d like to adjust the sensitivity on the fly also have the option to set the ISO dial to its ‘C’ setting and use the front dial, which has always been my preferred way of working when needing to setup and shoot quickly. As we’ve seen before, the on/off switch encircles the X100V’s threaded shutter button that accepts traditional style screw-in cable releases. Although the button next to it is no longer labelled as a function button, users will find that it can be held down to specify the setting you’d like to assign it to. Like previous generations, the X100V feels solid, well constructed and ready to put up with some rough and tumble as well as daily wear and tear. Its premium build quality is immediately obvious when you pick it up and it’s neither
        too big or heavy that it feels cumbersome or a burden to carry on days out. Another benefit of its new weather resistance is that it allows you to head out with just one camera. In the past many X100-series users have been known to carry a weather-sealed X-series body, such as an X-Pro2 , in their bag for when wet weather strikes. Provided you remember to pack or attach the weather resistant kit before heading out, taking a second weather-sealed camera out at the same time is no longer a necessity. Fujifilm X100V Review: Viewfinder and Screen Once again the X100V sports a hybrid optical/electronic viewfinder. In its optical mode the finder provides parallax-corrected frame lines, detailed exposure information and other icons revealing battery status, film simulation and image quality settings around the outside of the frame. It should be pointed out though that these aren’t always the easiest to view in bright or backlit conditions. Compared to the X100F’s optical viewfinder, which offered 92% coverage and a 0.5x magnification, the X100V’s has increased to 95% coverage and 0.52x magnification. The EVF, which is activated by pulling the switch at the front of the body, is the best we’ve ever used on an X100-series model. The jump in resolution to 3.69-million dots, higher 0.66x magnification and improved brightness contribute to a clear and refined viewing experience. Complimenting the upgraded viewfinder is an entirely new LCD screen that can be used for composition and playback purposes. The X100V is the first X100-series model to feature a two-way tilting 3in, 1.62-million-dot touchscreen that assists with shooting from the hip or any awkward angles. Fujifilm has overcome the challenge of implementing a tilting screen without adding any bulk by making it thin, but not so thin that it feels flimsy. One thing to note regarding its manoeuvrability is that when you’d like to angle the screen down you do need to pull it out a little first. The touchscreen control extends to the quick menu, however the main menu can’t be controlled by touch like we’ve seen on Fujifilm’s entry-level X-A7 and X-T200 mirrorless cameras. Fujifilm X100V Review: Performance To get a better understanding of how the X100V’s lens performs, I conducted several side-by-side tests with an X100F that was kindly loaned to us from MPB.com who specialise in buying and selling second-hand cameras. Just like the X 100F , the X100V produces impressive corner-to-corner sharpness with minimal distortion and chromatic aberration. At long focus distances the X100V’s lens produces marginally sharper results towards the edge when it’s used at its maximum aperture. Where the obvious difference lies though is at close focusing distances (see above examples). Images taken on the X100F appear very soft wide open when you attempt to focus on subjects as close as 10cm. Identical shots taken on the X100V revealed that sharpness at close distances is far superior, so much so you won’t find that you’re forced to stop down to f/4 or smaller like you are on the X100F. These findings confirm that the changes to the optical design have made a notable difference. That said, the lens does continue to exhibit veiling flare in instances when you shoot directly towards the sun. The lens hood (LH-X100) that Fujifilm makes for its X100-series can be purchased to help mitigate flare. The start-up time of the camera is rated at 0.5secs, which is slightly slower than the X-Pro3, but not something I found to be a deal-breaker. The auto power off function can be set between 15secs and 5 minutes and by setting this up you can preserve battery life, plus it saves you using the on/off switch quite as often. The advantage that comes with having many more phase detection points spread across the sensor is more responsive autofocus acquisition. The X100V doesn’t tend to hunt as much as the X100F, which is something I picked up on when the focus point was positioned towards the edge of the frame and I attempted several shots in a dim indoors environment. Although I didn’t encounter any missed opportunities during my testing because it failed to achieve focus fast enough, the fact the lens moves in and out during focusing does mean it can’t perform at the same rapid speed of today’s internal-focus lenses. Just like Fujifilm’s latest mirrorless cameras , face and eye detection makes critical focusing a breeze when shooting portraits, with a yellow square inside the green face detection box revealing which eye it’s locked onto. From the main menu the X100V provides a plethora of options to aid with day-to-day shooting. The mechanical shutter is very quiet, but having the option to take images in silence by activating the electronic shutter is great for street photographers who’d like to blend in with their surroundings and go about their work unnoticed. A couple of batteries should suffice for a day’s shooting if you don’t plan to charge the camera on the go via USB, but be warned
        that transferring images wirelessly can see the battery level drain very quickly. Having the option to plug the X100V into a USB power-bank or USB car adapter to ensure power levels don’t drop low is very convenient. There are no surprises in terms of the X100V’s sensor output. In typical Fujifilm fashion the quality of images straight out of the camera leaves nothing to be desired, with faithful colour and accurate exposure being met by high levels of detail and excellent noise control. The new Classic Negative simulation has quickly become a favourite of many X-Photographers and produces a vintage film vibe with increased saturation and more contrast than you get using Classic Chrome. When you go back to using the Standard/Provia mode after using some of the rich film simulation modes colours can appear a little dull and lacking in vibrancy. Experimenting with the tone curve using the highlight tone and shadow tone options that you’ll come across in the Q menu or main menu lets us to maximise the dynamic range in JPEG images without affecting raw files. Increasing the highlight tone to a positive value brightens the highlights and decreasing it to -1 or -2 retains detail in brighter areas. As for the shadow tone, increasing it to a positive figure darkens the shadows, whereas decreasing the value to -1 or -2 retains detail in the darkest areas. One slight peculiarity you’ll need to get your head around when adjusting these settings is the counterintuitive operation of the rear dial. A fast burst performance isn’t the be all and end all for street and documentary photographers, nevertheless it’s something we always make a point of testing. Loaded with a fast SDHC UHS-II card capable of 260MB/s read and 240MB/s write speeds the X100V managed to record 18 raw files at 8fps or 11fps using its mechanical shutter. This figure increased to 40 frames at 11fps when the image quality was set to Fine JPEG. Engaging the X100v’s electronic shutter allowed 17 raw files to be recorded at 20fps before slowdown occurred – one frame more than was recorded at 30fps with a 1.25x crop. Approximately 33 Fine JPEGs were recorded at 30fps before the camera showed signs of slowing. Fujifilm X100V Review: Image Quality The X100V features the tried and tested 26.1-million-pixel X-Trans CMOS 4 APS-C sensor that’s used by the X-T4 , X-T3 , X-Pro3 and X-T30 . It has a back-illuminated structure to enhance low-light performance and with no optical low-pass filter users will find extremely fine detail is preserved high into the ISO range. While the finest image quality is achieved by shooting in Raw, the quality of JPEGs straight out of the camera is astonishingly impressive. JPEGs don’t suffer from being too heavily processed, with colours remaining punchy and true-to-life. Fujifilm X100V: Resolution The level of detail recorded by the X100V’s sensor is comparable to the detail resolved by the X-T3, X-T30 and X-Pro3. It resolves a maximum of 3,400l/ph between ISO 100 and ISO 400, with resolution dropping ever so slightly at ISO 800 to 3,200l/ph. Pushing past ISO 800 sees the level of detail stand up extremely well with 3,200l/ph being resolved at ISO 1600 and 3,100l/ph at ISO 3200. Detail dips below 3,000l/ph when the sensitivity is pushed beyond ISO 6400. The detail resolved at ISO 12,800 (2,900l/ph) remains high and the sensor even manages to resolve 2,400l/ph when shooting in the expanded ISO 51,200 setting. Fujifilm X100V: Noise The X100V is the fourth Fujifilm X-series camera we’ve tested that uses the 26.1-million-pixel X-Trans CMOS 4 APS-C sensor. Shoot between ISO 80 and ISO 800 and you’ll be guaranteed wonderfully clean images free of noise. It’s only when you select ISO 1600 that you start to notice noise appearing under close inspection. Noise is so well controlled at the ISO 1600 and ISO 3200 settings that users won’t find themselves shying away from using them. ISO 6400 is useable too with some noise reduction applied, but luminance noise does start to become a little more pronounced in images captured at ISO 12,800. The detail that’s resolved at ISO 12,800 isn’t quite what it is at ISO 3200, however this wouldn’t put me off pushing the X100V to ISO 12,800 in low-light situations. The extended settings should be given a wide berth if you want to preserve optimum image quality.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Sending back the camera when I got home was a sad day. Even more so when I picked up my Pentax again after over a month off – wow did it feel heavy. Coming from a larger camera with a deep handgrip, the build of the X-S10 was a fine transition – it felt robust and lovely to hold. Does the Fujifilm X-S10 match up to the title of being one of the best cameras for DSLR users looking to shift to mirrorless? Yes. Did it meet all my requirements of a new camera if I were to upgrade? Yes, but I think I’d feel more at ease with a bigger battery life and the weather sealing my Pentax offers. However, I loved using it. If these factors don’t matter as much to you, then it is a perfect upgrade. Read our full Fujifilm X-S10 review here.

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Fujifilm X-S10 at a glance Spectacular views, snow topped mountain peaks, Christmas in the sun, quirky Aunts, and incredible wildlife – New Zealand has much to offer, especially for photographers, regardless of genre. So, when I booked my month-long bucket list trip across the world for December 2022 with my other half and his family, I knew this was the perfect opportunity to try something new and leave my beloved Pentax K-70 behind. Choosing my kit As an avid DSLR user that in the near to distant future is looking to upgrade her kit, I really didn’t know where to start when looking. This is where our buyers guides, and expert reviews came in to help me explore camera options and make a decision. When I was searching for a camera the top things I considered were: if it was DSLR user friendly , compact in size , lighter than my Pentax, easy to use and within a budget of around £1000 . I would call myself a fine art photographer, and usually my work incorporates street, landscape, and architecture – with my pinky toe dipping into wildlife and portrait photography occasionally. So, most of all, whatever I chose needed to be a good all-rounder. I wasn’t necessarily looking for a mirrorless camera. But given there are so many options out there now and I had an opportunity to try something completely different, then why not consider it? I made my decision for what to borrow based on what I would genuinely look to buy myself in the future. After a few weeks of research, I settled with the Fujifilm X-S10 . I also considered the Fujifilm X-T4 , but given my mentioned requirements and the fact I only had a month to use the camera, the junior X-S10 seemed like a better way to go. The reduced size and weight were a big bonus, especially when travelling around. It weighs a mere 465g (including battery and SD card) a whole 200g lighter than my Pentax body, taking the complete system with kit lens to less than a kilogram. Not only that, but as a junior version of the X-T4 it also offers many of the top-level features and performance, such as the 26-megapixel image sensor, AF system and in-body stabilisation, in a smaller, entry level body. Lenses for Fujifilm X-S10 I also chose a selection of lenses that were near the equivalent of my current Pentax lenses ( Pentax 18-135mm , 50mm and 55-300mm ). Firstly, the 16-80mm kit lens (£1,399 with Fujifilm X-S10, £699 lens only) and Fujifilm XF 70-300mm F4-5.6 R LM OIS WR (£749). Plus, the Fujifilm XF 23mm F1.4 R LM WR (£599) – as well as being named as our best all-purpose Fujifilm prime lens in our X-mount lens buyers guide AND now awarded the Prime Lens of the Year award at the 2023 AP Awards, at a 35mm full-frame equivalent this is a popular focal length for street and documentary photography. All those lenses are weather sealed, which gave me some reassurance that the X-S10 body didn’t. Taking three lenses might sound excessive, but with a wide range of potential subjects and the duration of my stay – I wanted options. At least that’s what I told my partner when explaining why I needed them all. Plus, as the X-S10 body measures only 126mm x 85.1mm x 65.4mm, I had plenty of space in the camera compartment of my bag for an extra lens. I used the Lowepro Truckee BP 250 LX backpack for this trip as hand luggage, and for carrying around my gear on walks. It has a dedicated space for camera gear, with a divider where I could put all my other in-flight essentials, and a laptop sleeve. Of course, I had a smaller bag in the suitcase for when I didn’t need, or want, to carry more than 1 or 2 lenses. Fujifilm X-S10: South Island road trip We had a plan for the first 2 weeks before Christmas to go travelling around the South Island – which of course included stopping at many hot spots for photography – including THAT Wanaka Tree. The first part of the tour saw us in Te Anau, with a boat trip planned at Milford Sound. Ideally here you would hope for rain to encourage waterfalls to come from the hills. Instead, on the day of our boat trip we were met by warm sunshine. I didn’t particularly mind this, especially as the camera isn’t weatherproof, despite having to completely cover up from potentially being eaten alive by sandflies. However, one hour into the boat trip we were met by mist rolling in and some light rain – we then experienced the sound in its moody glory, as well as the ‘Four Seasons in One Day’ phrase commonly used over in that part of the world. This is where I had a pang of worry over the camera getting wet as not only was it raining but this part of the trip saw us getting close to waterfalls. I had my trusty camera mac with me to stop getting soaked. The second pang came when the battery had depleted to 10% before the end of the 2-hour trip. Did I get too snap happy? Maybe. But the battery life for the X-S10 lasts for approximately 325 shots. Not great when you’re out photographing all day, especially if you only have one battery. However, the battery can be charged
        using the USB-C port, so my portable charger came in handy on the go. Lesson learnt. On our travels out of Milford we experienced the kea. A clever mountain parrot notorious for being cheeky and mischievous, and potentially ripping your windscreen wipers off without a thought. Now I don’t usually photograph wildlife, but this was one of my winning streaks of photographing animals in New Zealand. When the bird came up to our car and sat on the mirrors, I had to photograph its true character. The level of detail I was able to get was fantastic. Fujifilm X-S10 for street photography The next stop saw us in Queenstown – where I set myself the challenge of only shooting with the 23mm prime for some street shots. For the first time in my photography I felt inconspicuous on the streets. My Pentax is quite bulky as well as loud, so it’s not ideal if you want to be discreet. Not only am I used to a larger camera, but my go-to lens is the 18-135mm which gives me a range of options. I could have opted for the 16-80mm, but using a prime lens really made me think about what I wanted to capture, my positioning and image composition. I was impressed with how fast and quiet the combination was, meaning I could snap and capture moments as I saw them without a worry. Fujifilm X-S10 for Whale watching This was a different story going whale watching in Kaikoura – where I needed all the focal length I could get – along with strong sea legs. I took the 70-300mm lens. After our original timeslot being cancelled due to the whales feeding beyond the tour jurisdiction, we stayed an extra night in hope to see some wildlife. The 5am start the following morning paid off as we were lucky enough to see two sperm whales, many albatrosses, and a pod of dusky dolphins – who were joined by a southern right whale dolphin – the only dolphin without a dorsal fin. Of course, when watching these whales, everyone was hoping to see and capture the perfect tail flip shot as the whale dived beneath the surface. Continuous shooting came in handy when trying to capture the fast-moving dolphin pod. The X-S10 can shoot at 8fps mechanical, 20fps electronic and 30fps with a 1.25x crop. Safe to say after 3 hours, I couldn’t wait to get off the boat. But it was the main reason I wanted to bring a lens with a bit more zoom. Weighing 580g and measuring at 75mm x 133mm this zoom is compact, and not OTT. Keeping steady The in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) mechanism within the X-S10 works well and helped to counter any shake made from me and the moving boat, and still achieve shake-free shots. Likewise, optical image stabilisation is rated for 5.5 stops effectiveness for this lens and works together with the IBIS in the X-S10. Moments when you see a seal mother hoist her pup out from between some rocks and caterpillars forming cocoons are the prime opportunities to test the camera’s video skills. The X-S10 is capable of recording video in 4K at up to 30fps, and videos I took were notably free of shake and high quality. Fujifilm X-S10 image quality The performance of the Fujifilm X-S10 with all three lenses was fantastic. What really stood out for me was the colour and quality of the images. It produces high quality JPEGs that needed little or no editing in post processing. I’m not one for doing a lot of editing, so being able to get them right in camera is a real benefit. As such, for the majority – and all of those in this feature – I have not needed to do much major tweaking. I was impressed with the autofocus system. Not only was it quick, but the eye detection AF worked well when trying to get sharp focus – such for a portrait of the beautiful yellow eyed penguin shown below. As one of the rarest penguins in the world, getting this photograph was one of my top photo highlights from the trip. I visited this particular location twice in hope of seeing some. After having a miss the first time, upon our return I saw one penguin returning to the beach from sea. A fantastic sight. But on our way back to the car, some kind strangers saw my camera and informed me they saw some more penguins up by the main path. As promised, on the slow walk back up the path, there they were, a pair of penguins just off the path peering back at me through some bushes. Was I grateful for a silent shutter! The camera also performs well in low light, but getting photographs of little blue penguins on New Year’s Eve was much easier when they were standing pruning themselves under streetlights.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: As much as I like the DJI Mavic 3, the DJI Mavic 3 Classic would be my pick of the two drones. I don’t really have a need for the 162mm camera and the 24mm camera does a great job for stills and video. Like all DJI’s recent imaging drones, the Mavic 3 Classic is easy to set up and fly, and seeing the images on the controller screen is bound to put a smile on your face.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'DJI’s Mavic 3 Classic has everything that we love about the Mavic 3 in a more affordable package, Angela Nicholson has been flying it for our review DJI Mavic 3 Classic at a glance DJI has introduced the Mavic 3 Classic as a more affordable alternative to the Mavic 3 that was announced in November 2021, with the specifications of the two drones being almost identical apart from in one respect, the camera(s). Whereas the Mavic 3 has two cameras, the Mavic 3 Classic has just one. That might sound like a deal-breaker, but in this instance, it’s a shrewd move on the manufacturer’s part. That’s because the Classic has the Mavic 3’s 24mm equivalent 20MP Hasselblad camera with a Four Thirds sensor and it eschews the 162mm equivalent camera with a 1/2-inch sensor, which is really only suitable for checking distant objects and route planning. Consequently, the Mavic 3 Classic is able to shoot 20MP, 12-bit DNG raw files or 5.1K video at up to 50p while 4K video can be shot at up to 120p, which is ideal for anyone wishing to create slow-motion videos. Unlike with smaller drone cameras, the Mavic 3 Classic gives control over the aperture , ranging from f/2.8-11. That’s useful for controlling the shutter speed and keeping it to twice the frame rate for video. In addition, the sensitivity can be set in the range ISO 100-6400 for stills or video and the shutter speed range is 8-1/8000sec. DJI Mavic 3 Classic: Key Features DJI Mavic 3 Classic: Flight time Aside from the photographic specifications, one of the most impressive aspects of the Mavic 3 Classic is its flight time on a single battery charge. Like the Mavic 3, this is quoted as up to 46 minutes in flight or 40 minutes hovering . As before, I found these figures a little optimistic, but the wind strength and temperature play a role in how long the battery lasts. Nevertheless, I was able to fly for 36 minutes in still conditions at around 0°C. That’s a long time in drone terms, but I’d still be inclined to buy an extra battery (£179) or two, or invest in the Fly More Kit (£529) that includes two batteries, a charging hub, a car charger and spare propellers along with a bag. DJI Mavic 3 Classic: Easy flying DJI allows you to take full control over the flight of the Mavic 3 Classic, but the onboard navigation systems (GPS, Galileo and BeiDou) take the pressure off, ensuring that the drone it hovers where you release the control sticks and doesn’t drift. There’s also an omnidirectional object avoidance system that does a great job of spotting objects in the Classic’s flightpath. It can be set to stop the drone or fly around the object, or if you’re feeling confident, you can turn the system off to allow you to fly around the object manually. As usual, the Mavic 3 Classic has DJI’s QuickShots modes (Drone, Rocket, Circle and Helix) that fly the drone in specific patterns while recording to get professional-looking footage. There’s also the MasterShots mode that strings together some of the QuickShots modes to create dynamic footage, and ActiveTrack 5.0 that makes it easy to keep a subject in the frame while you take control of the flight. Stills photographers will be pleased to learn that the Mavic 3 Classic can shoot JPEG and DNG raw files, and there’s a panorama mode that captures a sequence of images that are stitched together automatically but can also be stitched using your preferred software. DJI Mavic 3 Classic: Image quality As it has the same camera as the main camera on the Mavic 3, it comes as no surprise to find that the Mavic 3 Classic produces superb video and stills with a good level of detail. Straight from the camera, the JPEGs look a little more vibrant and more share-ready than the raw files, but it only takes a few seconds to get the raw files looking great. Further good news is that DJI seems to have toned down the saturation of blue skies, so they look natural from the get-go. It’s also good to see that flare is controlled well and directing the camera straight towards the sun, or moving so the sun’s rays scud across the front element, didn’t cause any major issues with hot spots in my images. DJI Mavic 3 Classic: Controller options DJI sells the Mavic 3 Classic in three kits. The most affordable is the drone without a controller, for those who already have a compatible unit. The next kit includes the DJI RC-N1 controller which has a clamp and cables to connect it to a smartphone. Alternatively, there’s the kit with the DJI RC controller which has a built-in screen so you don’t need to connect your phone. If you can stand paying the extra £130, the DJI RC controller is quicker and easier to use, and it’s nice to have your phone free to use as normal.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: DJI has improved each generation of its Air drone significantly and the Air 2S makes a worthwhile upgrade on the Mavic Air 2. The Air 2S is both fun and rewarding to fly and while not matching a good DSLR or mirrorless camera, its results are beyond those of an action cam whether you’re shooting stills or video. It’s also very steady in flight and, even in blustery conditions when you may see it buffeted in the air, the footage is smooth. Also, thanks to the new four-antennae system (up from two), the transmission between the drone and the controller is stable.

      value: 'DJI has made significant upgrades to the camera for its DJI Air 2S consumer drone, Angela Nicholson has been flying it for our review. DJI Air 2S at a glance DJI Air 2S Body The DJI Air 2S makes a significant upgrade on the Mavic Air 2 by stepping up from a 1/2-inch type sensor with 12/48-million pixels to a 20Mp 1-inch type sensor. It can also record 5.4K resolution video in 10-bit D-Log for greater scope for post-capture adjustment (grading), and stills can be recorded in DNG raw as well as Jpeg format. In addition, the new drone has object avoidance sensors that face forwards, backwards, up and down. Only the sides are unprotected. The camera has an effective focal length of 22mm and the aperture is fixed at f/2.8. That pretty much assures that low ISO settings are used during day-time flying, but there’s a sensitivity range of ISO 100-12,800 for stills and video, dropping to 100-1600 in 10-Bit D-log mode. As well as single-shot mode, the Air 2S has a burst-shooting option, Auto Exposure Bracketing over three or five images in 0.7EV steps, a self-timer, an automatic SmartPhoto mode and four HDR Panorama options. On the video front, on top of the 5.4K (5472×3078) maximum resolution at 24/25/30fps, it can shoot 4K (3840×2160) or 2.7K (2688×1512) at 24/25/30/48/50/60 fps, and if you’re happy to drop to Full HD (1920×1080) you can capture footage at up to 120fps for slow-motion playback. There’s also a digital zoom of up to 4x at 4K 30fps, rising to 8x at Full HD at 30fps. Good to know: Flying the DJI Air 2S While the DJI Air 2S is stable and easy to fly, there’s a collection of automatic flying and recording modes that simplify capturing great-looking footage during smooth manoeuvres. In addition to DJI’s QuickShots modes which include Rocket, Circle, Dronie, Helix, Boomerang and Asteroid, which have been around for a while, the Air 2S debuts MasterShots mode. When this is selected, the pilot selects the subject by dragging a rectangle around it on the screen of their smartphone in the controller and then after ‘Start’ is tapped, the drone flies a series of manoeuvres automatically, recording as it goes. If the drone is set to 5.4K recording when MasterShots is selected, it defaults to Full HD mode, but it can be reset to 2.7K or 4K. Once the drone has completed its MasterShots flight of around 3 minutes, it returns to its starting point and the DJI Fly app automatically generates a video of around 15 seconds in length. You can also use the app to create additional videos from the footage, applying one of a number of themes that edit it automatically with a variety of effects, transitions and music. It’s fun, and the end results can resemble the opening sequence of a Netflix series, but the better news is that the original footage is stored on the drone’s internal memory or the inserted microSD card, so you can make your own longer edit. Drawing a rectangle around the subject on the screen in normal video mode activates the FocusTrack system that can be set to ActiveTrack 4.0, Spotlight 2.0 or Point of Interest 3.0 mode. In ActiveTrack 4.0, mode, the drone follows the subject (humans or vehicles) as it moves, keeping it in the centre of the frame. Spotlight 2.0 mode is similar but the pilot controls the drone’s flightpath while the drone keeps the subject in the frame. Point of Interest 3.0 mode is useful for static subjects and it sets the drone to fly around the subject as it films. All three modes work very well. However you’re flying the Air 2S, it’s important to remember that it doesn’t have object detection sensors on its sides and those sensors that are present may miss fine twigs or wires, which can result in you brushing off your tree-climbing skills if you’re not careful. The quality of the stills and video from the Air 2S is excellent, there’s plenty of detail visible and the larger sensor has a significant impact upon the dynamic range. However, the most attractive results are produced in good light. Dull conditions produce drab images and video.'

      value: Angela Nicholson reviews the DJI Mini 2 - the mini drone that represents excellent value for money - but is it still worth a look now that the DJI Mini 3 Pro is out?
    - type: conclusion
      value: The DJI Mini 2 is more stable and less easily buffeted by the wind than the Mavic Mini so the footage looks very smooth with plenty of detail visible. In addition, the enhanced transmission technology seems to make the connection between the controller and drone more reliable. It’s also very easy to fly and is great fun for anyone looking for their first drone or a small easily-portable drone to take anywhere. However, a set of magnetic ND filters is essential to anyone who wants the best-quality video. Now that the DJI Mini 3 Pro is out, the DJI Mini 2 offers a great alternative, especially if you budget doesn’t stretch to the Mini 3 Pro.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'DJI Mini 2 At glance Uprated video capability and raw shooting gives the Mavic Mini’s replacement, the DJI Mini 2, extra appeal for new drone pilots, Angela Nicholson takes to the sky to test it out. Although it has dropped the Mavic moniker, the Mini 2 is the upgrade to the DJI Mavic Mini that launched in October 2019. That created lots of excitement in drone circles because it weighs 249g, which means it comes under the CAA’s 250g threshold for the UK Drone Registration scheme. DJI has pulled off the same feat with the Mini 2, this time taking the weight down to 242g (with the battery, propellers and microSD card) despite uprating the motors and enhancing the transmission technology. New DJI Mini 2 Controller DJI has also improved upon the controller that comes with the Mavic Mini by supplying the Mini 2 with the same RC231 unit as comes with the Mavic Air 2. This is more robust, it’s easier to fit a smartphone in the clamp and there’s storage for their connection cable. Between the power and return-to-home buttons on the top of the controller there’s a handy switch to select the flight mode (Cine, Normal or Sport), which governs the drone’s speed and stopping distance. There’s also a dial on the front-left of the controller for adjusting the vertical angle of the gimbal and a shutter/record button on the front right. A button next to the right control stick lets you switch quickly between stills and video shooting while an Fn button next to the left stick can be customised to recenter the gimbal or toggle the phone screen between the map and live view with a single or double-tap. They’re all well-positioned and useful in-flight. Key settings such as the resolution, file type, frame rate, exposure and white balance are set via the DJI Fly app on the smartphone. Take-off and flying the DJI Mini 2 As usual, it’s well worth going through the initial set-up of the Mini 2 at home or somewhere with a decent Wi-Fi signal as you need to install the free DJI Fly app on your phone, create a DJI account and download the inevitable firmware upgrades. But with that done and a microSD card in drone’s card slot, you’re ready to head to your take-off location. With the smartphone in the controller clamp and connected, and everything powered up, the DJI Fly app usually opens automatically, but you can start it yourself if necessary. The app can take you through some preflight checks, but you can opt to ignore them if you’re confident of what you are doing. Then it’s just a case of pushing both control sticks diagonally down and together to start the motors before pushing the left stick up to take off. Like its predecessor, the Mini 2 has a 12MP 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor, a sensitivity range of ISO 100-3200, a fixed aperture of f/2.8, and a shutter speed range of 4-1/8000sec. Thanks to that aperture, the sensitivity doesn’t need to venture very high for daylight flying, while the small sensor, short focal length lens (24mm in 35mm terms) and long subject distances means that there’s plenty of depth of field. However, the wide aperture also means that neutral density filters are usually required to keep the shutter speed down to the recommended 2x the video frame rate. Although the Mini 2 has the same size and resolution sensor as the Mavic Mini, it’s capable of recording 4K footage (the Mini maxes out at 2.7K) and the quality is excellent, but you need to keep an eye on the angle of the sun as flare can be problematic. Sometimes this is attractive in video, but it can also cause hot-spots, low contrast areas and colour casts. Unlike the Mavic Mini, the Mini 2 can record raw files as well as JPEGs. This gives greater scope for post-capture adjustment and results in more natural-looking images. DJI quotes a battery life of 31 minutes, but I found 23-26 minutes more realistic in a slight breeze. That makes the two additional batteries and triple-charger of the Fly More Combo (£549) more appealing than the single battery kit. Good to know: QuickShots If you’re an experienced pilot it’s easy to dismiss the Mini 2’s Quick Shot modes, Dronie, Helix, Rocket, Circle and Boomerang, but they’re very good. These set up the drone to fly and film automatically to create smooth video without the need to move the sticks. Once the mode is selected you just need to set the subject of the film with a tap on the smartphone screen, or drag a box around it, and then tap ‘Start’. The Mini 2 flies around in a prescribed pattern before returning to its starting point like a faithful dog.'

      value: Angela Nicholson reviews the DJI Mini 3 Pro, DJI's most advanced mini-drone that weighs under the all important 250g
    - type: conclusion
      value: The DJI Mini 3 Pro offers a fantastic combination of features in a very compact and lightweight, easy-to-fly unit that produces superb video and stills. Its an excellent choice for photographers looking for their first drone, but it’s destined to used by experienced drone pilots who want something they can take everywhere as well. However, a case is essential to give it some protection in a backpack. Also, unless you already have a controller, or your budget won’t stretch to it, go for the £859 kit with the DJI RC controller because you get three more controls and quicker set-up with no need to connect your phone. Staying legal In the UK, you need to register your drone with the CAA and obtain an Operator ID and Flyer ID via https://register-drones.caa.co.uk .
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The new DJI Mini 3 Pro may weigh less than 249g but it has features that make it far more than a toy. Angela Nicholson has been flying it for our review. The DJI Mini 3 Pro is priced at £639 without a controller, £709 with the RC-N1 controller and £859 with the DJI RC controller. At glance DJI Mini 3 Pro Features The Mini 3 Pro is the latest of DJI’s sub-250g drones. That weight is significant because it means that you only need to get a Flyer ID and Operator ID from the CAA to fly it in the UK. With that fairly simple task done, you’re able to fly it pretty much wherever you like apart from in the flight restriction zones around airports, military bases and prisons etc. You can even fly over people as long as there isn’t a crowd of them. You should always have the permission of the landowner to take-off and land, but the freedom to fly with the Mini 3 Pro opens up a whole raft of aerial photographic and video opportunities. As you’d expect, keeping the weight of the Mini 3 Pro down to under 249g with the battery, propellers and a microSD card means it feels quite delicate, but it hasn’t stopped DJI increasing the size of the sensor in its camera from a 1/2.3-inch type in the Mini 2 to a 1/1.3-inch type in the new drone. That brings a significant step-up in image quality. Further good news is that the standard Intelligent Flight Battery that comes with the drone enables up to 34 minutes of flight. There’s also an Intelligent Flight Battery Plus that can enable 47-minute flights, but as that takes the drone’s weight over 250g, it’s not available in the UK or Europe. Four things you need to know about the Mini 3 Pro: DJI Mini 3 Pro – The camera DJI has used a 12MP sensor with a quad-Bayer design for the Mini 3 Pro’s camera. This means that each pixel is divided into 4 sections that can be read separately or together. Consequently, it can produce 12MP or 48MP images in raw or Jpeg format. While the results in 12MP mode are very good, the 48MP images really impress and have more detail than the 12MP when they are scaled to the same size. The lens has an effective focal length of 24mm while the aperture is fixed at f/1.7, so you’ll rarely need to push the sensitivity close to the ISO 6400 maximum. Video features In addition to stills, the Mini 3 Pro is capable of shooting 4K (3840 x 2160) at up to 60fps, 2.7K (2720 x 1530) at up to 60fps or Full-HD (1920×1080) video at up to 60p, or in slow motion mode, at up to 120p. Footage can be recorded in MP4 or MOV format in H.264/H2.65 at maximum bitrate of 150Mbps and with ‘Normal’ or D-Cinelike colour. Although the camera’s focal length is short, the fairly large sensor and f/1.7 aperture mean that you need to keep an eye on the focusing when you get close to subjects. DJI Mini 3 Pro – Automatic options Like DJI’s other recent drones, the Mini 3 Pro has the company’s Mastershots, FocusTrack and QuickShots options that make it easy to capture dynamic footage and keep the subject sharp. TikTok and Instagram story fans will also be pleased to learn that the Mini 3 Pro’s gimbal can rotate the camera through 90° to switch to portrait orientation with just a tap on the controller screen. There’s also a helpful object avoidance system with forward-, downward- and backward-facing sensors to help you avoid trees and the like while flying, but with no upward-facing sensor you need to take care when taking off under overhanding branches. While the Mini 3 Pro has a wind resistance rating of 10m/s (22.3mph) it seems to buffeted around quite a bit by a fairly light breeze. In most instances the gimbal is able to smooth this out, but you need to take care if you’re flying in a high spot. DJI Mini 3 Pro Pricing DJI sells the Mini 3 Pro for £639 without a controller for those who are upgrading and already have a remote control, or for £709 with the DJI RC-N1 Remote Controller which has a clamp to hold a smartphone to provide the screen for showing the Live View image and control options. Alternatively, the Mini 3 Pro can be bought with the new DJI RC controller for £859. This controller has screen built in so you don’t need to fiddle about connecting your phone.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Although it’s listed in DJI’s consumer range, the Mavic 3 has a sensor size that has previously only been seen in professional-level drones and there’s plenty to satisfy pro aerial landscape photographers and videographers. It’s also conveniently portable and, after the initial set-up, it can be ready to fly in a couple of minutes. As usual with DJI’s modern drones, the Mavic 3 is very easy to fly while the object avoidance helps keep it safe. Its price may give pause for thought, but it’s the best imaging drone available right now. Staying legal In the UK, you need to register your drone with the CAA and obtain an Operator ID and Flyer ID via https://register-drones.caa.co.uk . Also, although it’s new, the Mavic 3 is classified as a ‘legacy drone’ under the drone regulations and, as it weighs more than 500g, you must have an A2 Certification of Competence if you want to fly it closer than 150m from residential, recreational, commercial and industrial areas. After January 2023, you will need an Operational Authorisation from the CAA (which requires a General Visual Line of Sight Certificate) to fly within those distances.
    - type: excerpt
      value: At a glance The Mavic 3 is DJI’s widely anticipated replacement for the Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom. These drones feature 20MP 1-inch type and a 1/2.3-inch type sensors respectively, so the 20MP Four Thirds format sensor in the Mavic 3’s main camera marks a major step-up, with the larger sensor boosting image quality. When the 24mm (equivalent) main camera is in action, the Mavic 3 is able to shoot 12-bit DNG raw files or 5.1K video at up to 50p while 4K video can be shot at up to 120p – perfect for rendering action in slow-motion. Just above this camera, there’s a second camera with a 1/2-inch type CMOS sensor and an effective focal length of 162mm plus a digital zoom. This camera is limited to shooting JPEGs for stills or up to 4K video at 30fps and is best suited to checking out distant objects and route-planning, before flying closer to use the main camera. Returning to the 20MP camera, there’s a variable aperture (f/2.8-11) which is handy when you need to keep the shutter speed down to twice the frame rate for video. The sensitivity can be set in the range ISO 100-6400 for stills or video and there’s a shutter speed range of 8-1/8000sec. DJI Mavic 3 Key Highlights Longer, safer flights In a major upgrade, the rechargeable battery supplied with the Mavic 3 promises a flight time of up to 46 minutes. In reality, I found 36 minutes closer to the mark, depending upon the windspeed and how you fly, but that’s still a good flight duration. Nevertheless, I’d recommend buying at least one spare battery, or the Fly More Combo which comes with three batteries and a charging hub, so you can make the most of the light at your chosen location. Thanks to a collection of wide-angle sensors, the Mavic 3 has an omnidirectional object avoidance system that quickly detects objects in the flightpath and either stops the drone or directs it around the object depending on how you set it up. DJI has also upgraded the transmission system that operates between the controller and the drone, making it more stable and extending the range to 15km – which would require special permission. In addition, the Return to Home (RTH) system is able to take the windspeed into account and calculate the most power-efficient route back to its starting point, so you get maximum use out of the battery power. There’s also a collection of intelligent flight modes including the MasterShots that were introduced with the DJI Mavic Air 2S and QuickShots that have been around for quite some time. Interestingly, although the Mavic 3 is on sale, DJI has yet to release the firmware that unlocks these modes for the new drone. While features such as ActiveTrack 5.0 make it easier to keep a moving subject in the frame, most of the automatic and semi-automatic flight modes are nice additions rather than essential for the target audience of the Mavic 3. DJI Mavic 3 Image quality Thanks to the large sensor and high-quality optics, the Mavic 3 is capable of capturing superb-quality video and stills. Straight from the camera, the JPEGs look brighter than the raw files, but that’s easily addressed and both show a good level of detail. Blue skies tend to look oversaturated in both file types, but again this can be adjusted easily. If the drone is close to the subject and you set a wide aperture, you need to be careful about where you set the focus. But for most aerial shots, the depth of field delivered by the 24mm equivalent lens ensures that the scene is acceptably sharp. Flare can be a significant issue, so it’s important to keep an eye on the angle of the sun in your shots and check for hotspots.

    - type: conclusion
      value: Usually, I like to round up a camera review with a summary of its strengths and weaknesses, and why you might choose to buy it. But the Zeiss ZX1 is different, because there’s nothing else quite like it. Not just in terms of price – £5400 for a fixed-lens camera is crazy – or because of what it aspires to do. But instead, because so few cameras come to market these days so full of good ideas, yet so far off being the extension of your hand and eye that serious photographers yearn for. Indeed I can’t remember getting as annoyed by a camera for a long, long time. Mark Twain once famously described golf as ‘a good walk spoiled’, but he was lucky never to have spent an afternoon wandering the streets of Greenwich with the Zeiss ZX1. Not just a good walk spoiled, but all kinds of pictures missed, too. Not only because of the terrible viewfinder touch interface, but also thanks to the camera deciding that I wanted to turn on any number of random settings. All, it turns out, because I had the temerity to carry it on a neckstrap while wearing a t-shirt on a hot summer’s day. Then when it came to the camera’s whole raison d’etre, of processing and sharing images, ‘Unfortunately, Lightroom has stopped’. No, that’s not OK. It’s a real shame, because there’s a decent camera in there somewhere, struggling to get out. More firmware updates to eliminate the bugs and touchscreen mishaps aren’t out of the question. With enough extra development to fix its viewfinder touch interface, the ZX1 could perhaps be made to work quite nicely, but right now it’s impossible to recommend. Personally, I’d love to see Zeiss build that sensational lens into a more conventional camera instead. As it is, if you’re lucky enough to have £5,400 burning a hole in your pocket and are yearning for a full-frame compact, buy a Leica Q2 instead.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Zeiss ZX1 at a glance: This is a camera unlike anything else on the market. From the front, the Zeiss ZX1 reveals the conventional side of its personality, as a premium full-frame compact akin to the Leica Q2 , with a fixed prime lens and traditional dials for exposure settings. Turn it around to look at the back, though, and all the other controls you’d expect to see are conspicuous by their absence, replaced by a 4.3in touchscreen. This operates everything else, including the ZX1’s unique ability to run Adobe Lightroom Mobile for processing and sharing images. Zeiss first showed the ZX1 way back in September 2018 , and there’s a sense that bringing this ambitious concept to reality has consumed all its resources since then. Indeed the firm has only released one new lens in the intervening three years. Now that the camera is finally available to buy, it costs an eye-watering £5,400 ; in comparison, the Leica Q2 is £4,500. Putting Android on a camera isn’t an entirely new idea; it’s been tried before by both Samsung and Nikon. But despite the hope that it might pave the way for easier image editing and sharing, it’s never caught on. Instead, the camera companies have generally preferred to concentrate on improving their in-camera raw converters and making it easier to transfer pictures to your smartphone for sharing. But is this, in Zeiss’s hands, an idea whose time has come? Zeiss ZX1 – Features Firstly, let’s take a look at the ‘camera half’ of the ZX1. It’s based around a new 37.4MP full-frame sensor , which provides a sensitivity range of ISO 80-51,200. It’s not a speed freak, by any means, with a continuous shooting rate of 3 fps, which pales in comparison to the Leica Q2’s phenomenal 20fps. But on this kind of camera, with a fixed, fairly wide lens, that’s unlikely to be of concern. Zeiss has paired the sensor with a Distagon T* 35mm f/2 lens , but surprisingly hasn’t revealed any information about its optical construction. The aperture stops down to f/22, while the lens shutter provides speeds as fast as 1/1000sec, which can be extended further to 1/2000sec using an electronic shutter. Unlike on the Q2, though, the lens isn’t optically stabilised. A deep, bowl-shaped metal hood is supplied in the box, and felt-lined to suppress reflection of stray light into the lens, while filters are accepted via a 52mm thread. Autofocus employs a combination of phase and contrast detection, and the focus point can be positioned across almost the entire frame, aside from the extreme edges. As we’d expect, face detection is available for shooting portraits, but unlike most current cameras, this doesn’t extend specifically to eye detection. While it’s possible to record JPEGs while you’re shooting, the camera concept is fundamentally based around shooting raw files. These are recorded in the DNG format and are vast, at 76.7MB apiece (meaning they’re uncompressed, with each pixel value occupying two bytes). Uniquely there’s no memory card slot, with everything going to an integrated 512GB SSD . When you want to copy files to your computer, the simplest approach is to wire the two devices together. Equally unusual is the lack of any JPEG colour options for shooting images with different looks; after all, the whole idea is that you do this afterwards. But it does mean that you can’t preview shooting in black & white. When it comes to video, 4K recording is available at 30 fps, or Full HD at 60 fps. But there are some considerable catches, not least of which is a hefty crop that makes the equivalent focal length closer to 50mm. With no image stabilisation, no support for an external microphone, and no option to de-click the aperture ring, it feels like a feature that’s been added mainly for marketing purposes. Zeiss ZX1 – Focal points Zeiss ZX1 is a curious fusion of traditional analogue controls and touchscreen operation Zeiss ZX1 –  Android and Connectivity Where the ZX1 gets really interesting is in regard to its connectivity features. Like most modern cameras it includes both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi , but it uses them quite differently to the norm. The idea isn’t that you send images to your phone for editing and sharing, but that you do this on the camera itself, via Lightroom Mobile . You can still connect the camera to your phone, but this is used for geotagging your images using Bluetooth, or remote control of the camera over Wi-Fi. Also, because the ZX1 doesn’t have a mobile data connection of its own, you’ll need to use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for sharing images when you’re out and about. To use Lightroom Mobile, the ZX1 runs Android, but in a highly restricted way. There’s no access to Google services to download and run your favourite imaging apps, so you can’t use Snapseed for editing, for example. Social media support is limited to Instagram and Facebook, and logging onto your accounts isn’t done through apps, but via web browser pages. These have a habit of offering options, such as ‘Get Instagram
        App’, that the camera doesn’t support. You’re often also asked to log in to accounts multiple times during setup, first by the camera and then by Lightroom Mobile, which is rather disconcerting. As the camera has access to your social media accounts, albeit in a limited way, Zeiss recommends that you set a lock-screen PIN code to prevent unauthorised access. This would make sense, were it not for that fact that the camera demands your PIN every single time you want to take a picture. With practically every high-end smartphone capable of giving rapid access to the camera app and only requiring the unlock code to access other functions, it’s a mystery why Zeiss didn’t adopt the same approach. As it is, I guarantee users will turn off PIN protection within five minutes, which isn’t a good thing. Connectivity options don’t just extend to sharing, but also file backup . Support is built-in for cloud storage, specifically DropBox, OneDrive and Flickr, and it’s also possible to connect the camera to a network attached storage (NAS) device over a home Wi-Fi network. It can then automatically backup files to either the cloud or your NAS, which in principle is a great idea. Unfortunately, while you can plug an SSD drive into the ZX1’s USB-C port, I couldn’t persuade the camera to use it for backup, which would be really useful. You can tell the camera only to use specific trusted Wi-Fi connections for backup, which is worth turning on, if only to stop it using your mobile data. Backup isn’t a quick process, though; each raw file took 90 seconds to copy to my NAS over my 5GHz network. So if you shoot a lot of images in a session, backup will take ages and consume plenty of battery power. But the main problem I found is that if it misses a scheduled daily backup, due to not being connected to a Wi-Fi network, the camera won’t upload the missed files at the next opportunity, but instead seems to consider the task completed. Zeiss ZX1 – Build and Handling As you’d hope for a £5,400 camera, the ZX1 is built like a tank. It’s a sizeable beast too, at 142 x 93 x 94mm, which means it’s noticeably larger than the Leica Q2. In fact, it takes up as much space as a Sony Alpha 7R IV fitted with a small prime lens. Thanks to its all-metal body shell it’s decidedly weighty too, tipping the scales at 837g. So it certainly feels like you’re getting a reassuring amount of camera for your money. While the swept-back, angular grip has clearly been designed with style as much as practicality in mind, it’s very secure to hold while shooting, thanks to a generous soft rubber covering. But it’s not at all comfortable for carrying the camera around one-handed ready to shoot. Instead, the camera is best worn on a neck strap, and used two-handed with your left hand supporting the lens and operating its control rings. Zeiss provides a huge, seatbelt-like Peak Design Slide Lite strap in the box, but I preferred to use a slimmer alternative. In terms of operation, the ZX1 is a curious combination of the traditional and modern. Shutter speed and ISO dials are found on top behind the shutter release button, and joined by focus and aperture rings on the lens, all marked up in a slightly lurid yellow. A switch on the lens barrel selects between auto and manual focus, while another around the shutter dial toggles between photo and video modes and puts the camera into standby to save power. There’s also a tiny button on the back for autofocus and/or autoexposure lock. But everything else is controlled from the touchscreen. Both top-plate dials work nicely enough, with well-defined click-stops at each setting. The only catch is that they don’t have space for the entire range of settings, so if you want to set shutter speeds faster than 1/1000sec or slower than 1sec, you have to set the dial to the H or L position, then use the touchscreen. It’s the same story with setting sensitivities higher than ISO 6400, but as we’ll see, you don’t want to go there anyway. Personally, I’d much prefer to have an exposure compensation dial, rather than ISO, as it’s a setting I change far more often. In typical Zeiss fashion, both lens rings have smooth rubber grips that are impossible to tell apart by touch. The aperture ring clicks nicely at one-third stop intervals, but is much too easily nudged past the f/2 setting into its A position, which sets the camera to shutter priority or program modes. It’s a shame there’s no change in resistance at this point, or an interlock switch. All other settings are changed using the touchscreen on the back. This effectively works as two separate panels when you’re shooting, with the main screen on the left used to display the preview image, while the angled section to its right is used for the touch controls. Swiping up and down on this bar scrolls though the available settings, with four shown at any given time. Tapping on one then brings up a list of options alongside, which you select between using a vertical yellow slider.
        The first page of settings covers basic camera settings – exposure compensation, drive mode, white balance and metering – while the second covers everything to do with focusing, namely AF point selection, AF area mode, single/continuous focusing and focus area size. Then there are options to view or hide compositional aids (gridlines, electronic levels and so on) and the frankly brilliant concept of shooting images to different ‘collections’ which are grouped separately for playback. However, this settings list is context sensitive, so changing one can make others disappear and new ones show up in their place. This approach has the advantage of keeping the interface clean and uncluttered by greyed-out icons, but can also be quite confusing if you make an accidental change. Zeiss’s touch interface works rather well when you’re using the LCD for composition. Unfortunately, though, the shooting experience falls apart completely the moment you switch to the viewfinder, with the camera becoming utterly exasperating instead. The biggest problem is that while the interface looks the same, just with a blue cursor shown in the viewfinder to indicate your thumb position, it behaves rather differently. Moving through the settings list now requires you to hold your thumb down for a second at unmarked positions either end of the touch panel, which slows things down annoyingly. Then to change a setting you no longer need to grab and move the vertical slider, but just tap on it at any point. This design has two huge problems. Firstly, because the touchscreen is very sensitive to light touches, it’s exasperatingly prone to accidental changes from a brush of your thumb in the wrong place. Even worse, the screen is so sensitive that it can be operated through a t-shirt. So if you walk around with the ZX1 hanging on a neckstrap, as it’s designed to be used, it can activate and change settings of its own accord as it bounces off your body. For example, I frequently found that the camera had decided I wanted to use +3EV exposure compensation or the 10-second self-timer, both of which are great ways of messing up pictures. I was also frustrated by the fact that my two most-used options, exposure compensation and focus area selection, are in different sections, requiring a lot of thumb movement to switch between them. Then when you tap the button to engage AF area selection, a little trackpad appears on a different section of the screen, requiring even more thumb movement just to use it. I didn’t get on especially well with the trackpad either, as the focus point had a habit of jumping to the extreme left of the screen for no discernible reason. I assume I must have been doing something wrong, but I have no idea what. You might be better off pretending it’s the 1990s still, and sticking to a single, central focus point. Ultimately, the ZX1 provides anything but the seamless, intuitive shooting experience that you really want with a camera up to your eye. I’d much prefer to be able to group the settings I change most often onto one screen and hide everything else, which would make for a much better experience. To engage playback, enter the menus, or access Android/Lightroom, you swipe vertically on the left side of the LCD.  The non-camera modes all use familiar smartphone-like touch interfaces and are reasonably intuitive to operate, not least because the menus are quite sparse. One irritating playback quirk is that the camera displays raw and JPEG files of the same image separately, so if you’re recording both, you have to scroll past every picture you’ve shot twice. High ISO raw files are initially displayed without any noise reduction, making them look even worse than they really are. Zeiss ZX1 – Viewfinder and screen On paper, the ZX1’s viewfinder and screen look excellent. The EVF is a high resolution 5.33m-dot unit offering 0.74x magnification, while the 2.76m-dot LCD is huge by camera standards, at 4.3 inches in diagonal. But in practice, it’s not quite that simple. In many ways, the viewfinder is very good indeed. It displays plenty of detail and previews exposure and depth-of-field on a half-press of the shutter button. It also replicates the LCD layout, with a 3:2 preview image and settings buttons in a separate column on the right. But as a spectacles wearer, I found I had to centre my eye pretty much perfectly to see it clearly, as otherwise the left or right side of the display became extremely smeared. I haven’t come across a viewfinder this sensitive to eye position before. Secondly, as with much of the ZX1, the eyecup appears to be designed mostly for style rather than function. It’s very shallow indeed, which makes the viewfinder extremely prone to being overwhelmed in sunlight, especially as the display isn’t all that bright to begin with. Another quirk comes when changing exposure settings. Swiping left on the screen can be used to hide the shutter speed, aperture and ISO settings, giving a cleaner preview
        for composition. But then when you spin any of the dials, the camera resolutely refuses to show what you’ve done. This isn’t so bad when you’re using the rear screen, as you can just glance at the dials, but it’s a real problem with the camera to your eye, and really needs to be fixed with a firmware update. Turning our attention to the LCD, again it’s impressively sharp and detailed, and previews colour and exposure well. But being fixed, it’s not nearly as useful as a tilting or articulated unit, as it demands you hold that weighty body out in front of you for shooting. As a result, I shot almost exclusively using the viewfinder. Zeiss ZX1 – Autofocus When it comes to autofocus, the ZX1 performs acceptably, particularly bearing in mind its fixed 35mm lens. It’s far from being the quickest camera in the world, but equally, it’s not so slow as to be troublesome. However, if you’re hoping for a street-shooter that can track focus on people moving unpredictably within your scene, this isn’t going to be the best answer. Face detection works quite well at picking out potential subjects, even when they’re small within the frame and not looking directly at the lens. If the camera can’t find a face, it will revert back to the size and position of the focus point that was in previously use. However, the options to move the focus area or change its size get hidden from the touch interface when face detection is enabled, and you can’t change either with the camera up to your eye. When using the screen for composition, you can reposition the focus point by tapping on the subject, but still can’t adjust its size. So you really need to disable face detection whenever you’re not using it. Switch to manual focus, and there’s a choice of either a peaking display or magnified view to judge focus; I preferred the latter. You can toggle between 2x and 4x magnification, which is just about high enough, and move the region of interest around the scene using the touchscreen trackpad. The focus ring works non-linearly, meaning that the focus distance changes more quickly the faster you turn it. This has the advantage of allowing quick focus shifts followed by precise fine-tuning, but gives a rather detached feel to the overall experience. Zeiss ZX1 – Performance When you head out to take photographs with the Zeiss ZX1, you’ll find that it’s a capable, if quirky camera. Because it’s Android-based it takes about 20 seconds to start up from being powered off completely, so in normal use you flick it into standby when you’re not using it, just like a smartphone. However all those smart features are rather power hungry, in a fashion that can’t be stated simply in terms of shots per charge. In practice, I found I needed to recharge the battery after each day shooting. Like other lens-shutter cameras, the ZX1 is very quiet indeed, so you won’t draw attention to yourself while you’re working. In general, it responds instantly to inputs from both the dials and touchscreen – indeed as I’ve already explained, the latter is too sensitive. But unfortunately, the camera is also just a bit buggy; I’ve experienced the touchscreen stopping working, and Lightroom crashing repeatedly. There’s also the occasional bit of careless programming; for example, if you define a minimum shutter speed for Auto ISO, the ZX1 applies it to manual ISOs too, which is plain wrong. This is with firmware version 1.5, meaning it’s already gone through several rounds of updates and fixes, and isn’t really acceptable at such a high price. I found the metering to be extremely conservative, frequently veering towards underexposure. This has the advantage that the camera rarely clips highlights, but I often found myself applying positive compensation, either in-camera or during raw processing. There is, at least, a reasaonble amount of dynamic range to play with at low ISOs to pull up shadow detail, if probably not quite as much as other current full-frame sensors, meaning that there’s an increased risk of noise creeping in. On a more positive note, auto white balance is practically flawless, and if you wish to record JPEGs alongside your raw files, their colour rendition is really quite attractive. As we’d expect from Zeiss, the best part of the camera is the lens, which is absolutely sensational. It’s impressively sharp wide open, fading off only a little in the extreme corners, and superb across the frame when stopped down to normal full-frame working apertures around f/8. There’s no hint of chromatic aberration and just the tiniest degree of barrel distortion, which you’ll only see when by flicking between corrected and uncorrected views in Lightroom. As we’d expect there’s pronounced vignetting wide open, but with a nice smooth falloff profile, it’s more likely to enhance your pictures than spoil them. Out-of-focus backgrounds are rendered beautifully, with a lovely smooth fade from sharply focused regions. Meanwhile landscape photographers should appreciate the
        reasonably well-defined 18-point sun-stars produced at small apertures. Indeed my only criticism is that the lens can be prone to flare when shooting into the light with the sun just outside the frame, even with the hood installed. Zeiss ZX 1 – How well does Lightroom Mobile work? So how about the whole point of the ZX1, the Lightroom Mobile experience? In a way this is the most problematic aspect of all, because while a 4.3in screen sounds huge for a camera, it’s tiny compared to almost any current smartphone. As a result, Lightroom feels very cramped. If you hold the camera in its natural, landscape orientation, the preview image starts a decent size, but then when you start editing it shrinks and gets overlaid by tiny imprecise sliders, making for an exercise in frustration. Rotate the camera through 90 degrees and the sliders get much longer and easier to adjust precisely, but the preview image shrinks dramatically. To be honest, Lightroom works better on my phone, thanks to its considerably larger screen. One nice feature is that any edits you make sync back to the cloud-based version of Lightroom on your computer (but not, to be clear, Lightroom Classic). But then again, the same is true if you run Lightroom on your phone. Overall, I’d still much prefer to edit my pictures on my laptop. Zeiss ZX1 – ISO and Noise At low ISO settings, the ZX1’s 37.4MP sensor gives exactly the kind of detailed, noise-free images that we’d expect. It continues to give fine results as the sensitivity is raised to ISO 3200, at which point just a little luminance noise is visible when pixel-peeping files onscreen. But beyond this, things fall apart surprisingly quickly; some blotchy low-frequency colour noise appears in darker tones at ISO 6400, and I’d only consider ISO 12,800 usable with high levels of noise reduction applied. Overall, the sensor simply doesn’t match our expectations of a modern full-frame unit in this regard. Below are 100% crops from our standard scene, shot in raw then processed using Adobe Camera Raw.

    - type: excerpt
      value: As you might expect for somebody working on a photography magazine, taking pictures comes quite high up in my list of favourite things to do. That said, over the years there have been fewer and fewer occasions where I’d find myself taking a camera out solely for pleasure, my own amusement or to capture the moment. Usually, I’m testing the latest camera or lens (I’m not complaining), which means there’s a job to be done and relaxation not to be had. Having a personal project has been a good way in the past to maintain a sense of freedom and imagination in my photography, but with an increasingly busy schedule, it’s something that had fallen rather by the wayside in previous years. Having finally gotten enough mojo to start a new in-depth project at the beginning of 2020, certain other global catastrophic events – along with a number of upheavals in my personal life – also meant that once again I was left without an outlet for my creativity. Feeling compelled to change that, I decided I would once again start a new project in 2021, but one which would need to be both mindful of any Covid-related restrictions and relaxed enough to take away any pressures of an specific brief. With that in mind, and with walking pretty much the only permissible activity for large chunks of the past 18 months, I decided to set up a perfunctorily titled blog, Walks of 2021. The next thing I needed, of course, was a camera. Although I wasn’t particularly concerned about always using the same camera (and indeed, there are plenty of occasions when I have used different ones throughout the project), I wanted one that I knew I could rely on, not have to worry about testing it, and importantly, know that it wasn’t imminently due to be returned, as is usually the case with standard review samples. I also wanted it to be small and light enough to be carried around frequently without bother, but also it needed to be tactile enough to use with gloves, as I’d be starting the project on 1 January. Having had the privilege of testing almost all of the cameras on the market, there were a few that came to mind for the project. It came down to a close-run thing between the Fujifilm X100V and the Panasonic Lumix LX100 II. Although the Fujifilm X100V is a wonderful camera – and in an ideal world I’d probably choose both – I decided that the Panasonic Lumix LX100 II made for a more flexible choice, with its zoom lens giving better scope for a wider variety of shots. Generously, Panasonic has loaned me the camera on a long-term basis while I work on this project, but, it also has the benefit of being cheaper than the X100V should I decide to buy it for myself once the loan is inevitably called back in. I’d also had extensive experience of using the LX100 , the Mark II’s predecessor, having taken it with me during a month-long visit to New York all the way back in 2015. Back then I’d loved its portability and versatility, and it sealed its fate in my mind as pretty much the perfect travel and street camera. The LX100 II was announced in 2018, some four years after the original iteration. It keeps broadly similar specifications to its predecessor, with a series of incremental upgrades that add up together to make quite a comprehensive refresh. That said, you can save yourself a small fortune by opting for the older model, especially on the second-hand market. A quick scan of MPB reveals that you can pick up an original LX100 in ‘good’ condition for as little as £249, which would be an excellent investment if you’re looking for a small and unobtrusive addition to your kit bag and don’t mind missing out on a few of the benefits of the newer model. By contrast, the LX100 II currently retails for around £730 new, or around £550 second-hand. My feeling is that it still represents excellent value for money considering what you get for your cash, and in my case, how extensively I have used it. LX100 II Features and specifications Using the same 21.7MP sensor of the interchangeable lens Lumix GX9 model, a bump in resolution is one such upgrade from the original LX100. What’s particularly interesting to note however is the fact that it is a ‘multi-aspect’ sensor (see below). Paired with the sensor is a Leica DC Vario-Summilux 24-75mm (equivalent) f/1.7-2.8 fixed lens. This is a neat and compact lens which retracts into the body when the camera is switched off, again another plus point for portability and travel. Although you can’t quite fit the LX100 II into a trouser pocket (unless perhaps you’re MC Hammer), it can handily fit inside a jacket pocket – or of course, a small bag or pouch. The rear LCD screen is touch-sensitive, which is another improvement from the original LX100. It can be used to control various functions such as setting the AF point, moving around menus and flicking through images in playback. Slightly disappointing was the decision to stick with a fixed screen, though. Here I would have preferred to see a tilting option to give a
        little extra flexibility when shooting from awkward angles, particularly in discreet street scenes. If you’re anything like me, your main preference will be shooting through a viewfinder, rather than via the screen. I briefly considered using the Fujifilm X70 for this project, a superb little pocket-friendly camera with an APS-C sensor I’ve had for several years. I knew however that I’d quickly get frustrated with its lack of a viewfinder if I was using it very frequently. Although not the biggest, brightest or best viewfinder in the world, the LX100 II’s 2.76-million-dot OLED EVF is more than adequate enough to allow for happy composition. This viewfinder is the same as found on the LX100, so no surprises there either. I’m not particularly bothered by video specifications, but for those that are, the LX100 II includes 4K video recording, as is pretty much the standard now. When recording 4K, a 1.2x crop is applied, so you lose some area of whatever focal length you’re recording at. Perhaps more interestingly for stills shooters is 4K Photo, something we’ve seen on Panasonic cameras for years now. This setting allows you to extract stills from short video clips, and can occasionally come in handy when recording action and movement to grab the exact moment you want. Battery life is important for any camera, but it’s particularly essential when you’re thinking about a travel camera. A small, but key improvement, for the LX100 II is the ability to charge it via USB. This means both that you don’t need to remember to pack a dedicated charger in your luggage, and that you can give it quick power bursts on the go from a power bank. I’ve never had a problem with the battery expiring during a day’s shooting – I always switch off the camera in between shots, and with video being a rarity for me, the quoted overly-cautious 340-shot battery life (270 if you’re predominantly using the viewfinder) is generally more than I need. Using the camera It may seem incongruous to talk so frequently about the LX100 II being the perfect camera for travel, yet choosing it for a project at a time when all travel was effectively banned. Indeed, here in Wales where I live, travel was so restricted that all journeys (for pleasure) had to start and end from your front door, and could only be carried out on foot or via bicycle. Although I could perhaps have easily argued that I needed to travel by car to take pictures for work, as I was carrying out a personal project I didn’t think that would be in keeping with the spirit of the regulations. While ‘travel’ may have been limited, without transportation being an option, something being light and portable was more important than ever. I challenged myself to find new and interesting locations within walking distance of my home, and am fortunate enough to find myself living in a place with a great variety of different subjects all easily reachable by foot. Once I’d exhausted the opportunities within a couple of miles radius however, it was time to dig out the hiking boots and explore options further afield – and it was here that not having the weight of an interchangeable lens system plus multiple optics really came into its own. I felt free to go on 5-10 mile walking trips and not feel encumbered, not only by the weight and bulk of something larger, but also by the extra choice that additional optics often brings. Again, it might seem like an incongruous thing to say, but being restricted can often make me feel freer. It was something I felt in New York with the original LX100, and is certainly something I feel now with its successor. Having just one camera/lens – and no option to swap lenses or systems – while out and about focuses on my mind on actually looking at my surroundings, which in turn leads to picture opportunities that I might otherwise have missed. We’ve spoken in this magazine before about the benefits of photography for our mental health, with mindfulness often used as an associated phrase. Using the LX100 II for this project very much tied in with that. At a time of severe isolation and heavy restrictions, having the project to set my mind to, and having a simple and unobtrusive camera with which to do it, gave me something to think about other than the less-than-pleasant reality of the overall situation. It also gave me a greater and deeper appreciation for my local area, and taught me to be grateful for the existing opportunities that exist within it. As already mentioned, one of the things that a camera needed to offer – at least in the early cold months of the project – was a good degree of tactility. You get that very well with the LX100 II. Not only does it offer a shutter speed and exposure compensation dial on the top plate , but there’s also an aperture ring around the lens so you can quickly make all the changes you need without having to touch any part of the screen or adjust fiddly and small buttons. Also found around the lens is a switch for choosing one
        of the aspect shooting ratios, and another for moving between autofocus, manual focusing and – something which I found handy on numerous occasions – macro focusing, which enables you to get as close as 3cm. There are times when using the touchscreen comes in handy. In general, I’ve found that a combination of working with it and the buttons in tandem provides the best shooting experience. But it’s handy to not have to rely on either one or the other to do everything I need or want to do. The pictures Back in 2015 when I used the original LX100 so extensively I was extremely happy with the pictures that I captured. Having tested out the LX100 II when it came to the market in 2018, as well as the GX9 with which it shares a sensor, I was similarly confident in its abilities to produce excellent pictures, and I have to say on the whole I have not been disappointed. I’m not going to pretend that the capabilities of the camera match some of other models that I use with frequency – such as the Nikon Z7 II – but neither do I expect it to. There is always a compromise to be made when it comes to size and weight, and I’m mostly more than happy with the trade-off that the LX100 II provides me with. A Four Thirds sensor is still much larger than that found in smartphones, and significantly bigger even than those found in typical premium compact cameras, such as the Sony RX100 VII or the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III, which being small and light were also potential contenders for the project. As such, the level of detail that the LX100 II provides is excellent and it copes well in a variety of situations. I don’t use it all that often in low light, but certainly in the winter months when it wasn’t always bright, it coped admirably well. The LX100 II’s attached lens is one that some have called to be made available as an interchangeable lens option for Micro Four Thirds cameras, and I can see why it would be appealing. It gives the same kind of flexibility as a typical 24-70mm type lens, while collapsing down to a very small size. Being able to open up to f/1.7 (at the widest angle) enables the creation of shallow depth of field effects and helps with the performance in low light. The future Now being three years old, the time is arguably ripe for an upgrade to the LX100 II. Since 2018, a fair amount has changed within the market, and there seems to be no rumours suggesting that Panasonic is working on evolving the LX100 line. If and when that happens there’s not a huge amount that I would like to see changing – with the big obvious exception being the addition of a movable screen. In an ideal world, I’d also like to see that zoom extended just a touch. Although 75mm is pretty good, going up to 100 or 125mm would make it even more flexible and help grab those extra shots that remained just slightly out of reach on occasion. I’d be prepared for a small amount of extra bulk to accommodate this, especially if it meant keeping the wide maximum-aperture. With its existing prowess in mind however, the LX100 II already makes for one of the best travel cameras on the market today. Since lockdown restrictions have gradually eased, I have found myself using the camera a little less than before. Now that we are permitted to drive again, it’s easier to take out larger and heavier cameras for my outings. But, it’s fantastic to know that the camera is ready to go for those times when I want the perfect blend of portability and image quality, leaving me free to concentrate on the surroundings and enjoy the much-needed freedom that photography provides. For now, my Walks of 2021 blog continues, but includes walks further afield from those that I can reach on foot from my front door. If you want to see more pictures from my adventures, please visit walksof2021.com . The multi-aspect sensor The LX100 II’s sensor is “multi-aspect”, meaning you never actually use the entirety of its 21.7MP sensor at any one time. You can shoot in 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 and 1:1 without narrowing the diagonal angle of view, with a small switch on the side of the lens enabling quick changes between the options. I have found that having the physical switch acts a great reminder to actually use the different ratios available, adding to the scope of creativity at the point of capture, rather than it being a cropping afterthought during editing. Since multi-aspect is achieved by using only up to 85% of the sensor’s area at any given time, the maximum resolution achievable is roughly 17 megapixels. That should still be enough for most scenarios, as well printing up to A3 size at high quality. The example to the right is shot using the 1:1 (square) setting.

    - type: conclusion
      value: In a way, it’s almost pointless trying to assess a £5000 camera with a fixed 28mm lens that can only shoot in black & white. It’s such a niche concept that the vast majority of photographers will never remotely contemplate buying it. But for those who can afford it and are confident it will fit their artistic vision, the Leica Q2 Monochrom is a truly lovely camera. First of all, it’s clearly been designed by people who intimately understand how a camera should work. Leica has included intuitive physical controls for everything you need to change on a shot-by-shot basis, with quick access to secondary settings provided by the onscreen status/control panel. It’s also included just enough customisation to allow you to tweak the camera for your own needs. As a result, the Q2M is a real pleasure to shoot with. Then there’s the superb output. When I reviewed the M10 Monochrom I declared that it gives probably the best monochrome image files you’ll find, but the Q2M’s might be even better, thanks to its higher resolution. Low ISO raw files contain immense amounts of detail into the deepest shadows, while high ISOs can almost be used with impunity. Of course there are bound to be debates over whether a 28mm lens is the ‘correct’ choice for this kind of camera, rather than 35mm or even longer. But to me it makes sense given the sensor’s resolution and well-implemented zoom modes; after all you can’t crop a 28mm view from a 35mm lens. And for those who’d definitely like a 47.5MP B&W sensor coupled with a 50mm AF lens, it’s now surely only a matter of time before the SL2 Monochrom appears.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Leica Q2 Monochrom at a glance: Leica is indelibly associated with black & white photography. Its unique position within the market, making low-volume, high-priced cameras, also allows it to deliver concepts that mainstream makers couldn’t contemplate. Put the two together, and it’s no surprise that it’s the only company to have produced full-frame cameras dedicated to shooting in black & white. Indeed its third-generation M10 Monochrom that arrived earlier this year is very special indeed. With the new Q2 Monochrom (which for the sake of brevity, I’ll call the Q2M from now on), the firm has transposed the idea to a different type of camera. Based on last year’s Q2, it employs a 28mm f/1.7 optically stabilised lens that’s fixed rather than interchangeable. It also uses a new version of the Q2’s 47.3MP full-frame CMOS sensor that’s been stripped of its colour sensitivity, rather than its sibling’s 40.9MP chip. The other big difference lies with the price: at £4995, the Q2M is slightly less unaffordable than the M10 version, which costs £7250 without a lens. Read more: Best cameras for black and white photography Building a monochrome camera might sound like a pointless exercise; after all, you can make really nice black & white prints from colour files. But it offers genuine image-quality advantages, delivering increased detail, greater dynamic range and lower high-ISO noise. In short, if you really want to shoot in black & white, a dedicated sensor will give the best possible image files. The main penalties are that it’s intolerant to over-exposure, and that subject-tracking autofocus is unavailable (as it requires colour information to work). Leica Q2 Monochrom: Features In many respects, the Q2M offers the same specifications as the standard Q2. However its ISO range covers 100-100,000 rather than 50-50,000, reflecting the increased sensitivity that comes from omitting the light-sapping colour filter array over the pixels that’s used by conventional sensors. Raw images are recorded using Adobe’s open-standard DNG format, which means that you probably won’t need to upgrade your imaging software to process them, and Leica claims that the 14-bit files offer up to 13 stops of dynamic range at ISO 100. Thanks to its Maestro II image processor, the camera can shoot at 10fps with the mechanical shutter, or 20fps in electronic mode. This is seriously impressive given the high resolution, and should be more than fast enough for a camera with a fixed wideangle lens. It offers a shutter speed range of 2 minutes to 1/2000sec using its mechanical shutter, extending to 1/40,000sec using the silent electronic shutter for shooting at large apertures in bright light, with the camera capable of switching seamlessly between the two modes. The lens is the same 11-element, 9-group 28mm f/1.7 design as previous Q models, which includes three aspherical elements to minimise peripheral aberrations. Unusually for a full-frame fast prime it’s optically stabilised, which gives the camera extraordinary low-light capabilities. Leica has included an Auto OIS option that only operates at shutter speeds of 1/60sec or slower, and otherwise keeps the IS group centred for maximum sharpness. This makes perfect sense in a camera that’ll mostly be used hand-held, and I’d leave it switched on all the time. Leica has included a set of crop modes for shooting at longer equivalent focal lengths, with a rangefinder-style frameline superimposed on the 28mm view for composition. Set using a small button on the back, the crop is only applied to JPEGs, which mercifully aren’t then up-sampled as with other brands’ digital zoom functions. The camera records a full-size DNG alongside, with the crop information stored in metadata. There’s a 35mm equivalent crop that provides 30MP resolution, 50mm equivalent at 15MP, and 75mm equivalent at 7MP, which is still sufficient for a nice A4 print. Obviously this isn’t the same as having an optical zoom, but it can still be surprisingly handy. While it may look like a very basic, traditional camera, the Q2 Monochrom actually hides away a range of useful options in its menus. These include comprehensive exposure-bracketing options, a fully featured intervalometer for time-lapse shooting, and multi-pattern, spot and average metering. In place of colour modes it offers a set of six toning options, with sepia, blue and selenium each available in either weak or strong, alongside the standard neutral monochrome output. While they’re all quite attractive, I’d stick with the weaker versions, and particularly like the selenium effect. There’s also programmable auto-ISO that allows you to set a minimum shutter speed suitable for the kind of subject you’re shooting; alternatively you can choose an Auto mode that’s tied to the effective focal length of the crop mode. The Q2M is also capable of recording movies in 4K (3840 x 2160) at 30fps, or Cinema 4K (4096 x 2160) at 24fps, with just a small field of view crop to
        accommodate its electronic video stabilisation. It has built-in stereo microphones, but no connector for an external unit, so you’d need to use a separate recorder for higher quality sound. There’s no port to provide an HDMI output for an external recorder, either. On a more positive note, all of the toning options are available during video recording. As with many other recent cameras, the Q2M features Bluetooth connectivity. This simplifies pairing with your smartphone for use with the free Leica FOTOS app, and can also switch the camera’s Wi-Fi on and off for remote control, or browsing and copying images. One neat feature is the ability to keep the camera’s clock automatically synced with your phone, which should be handy for those travelling between time zones. Leica Q2 Monochrom: Focal points Leica’s Q2 Monochrom presents a beguiling mix of the retro and the modern. Leica Q2 Monochrom: Build and handling As befits its £4995 price tag, the Q2M is built like a tank, with a metal-shelled body that’s sealed against dust and water to the IP 52 standard. Leica has made a point of paring down the external design, giving a sleek, minimalist look. The rounded ends, borrowed from the firm’s iconic M-series rangefinder cameras, make it unexpectedly comfortable to hold. Aesthetically, Leica has played with the Monochrom theme, with the camera finished in a stealthy matte black and omitting the red dot name-badge that’s found on the stock Q2. The various dial and control markings are all grey or white, meaning that there’s no colour on the body whatsoever. It’s a very stylish-looking, purposeful design, but the lens markings can be tricky to make out in low light. In its trademark fashion, Leica has done a fantastic job of stripping back the physical controls to offer exactly what you need while shooting, with a traditional shutter speed dial on top, and aperture and manual focus rings on the lens. There’s also a control dial under your thumb for setting exposure compensation and ISO, and a d-pad for moving the focus point. A column of three buttons beside the rear screen deals with playback and menus. The aperture ring is marked in whole stops down to f/16, with detents at 1/3-stop steps. Set to the A position, it allows shooting in program or shutter priority modes. Beside it is a perfectly damped manual focus ring, complete with distance and depth-of-field scales to allow the use of zone or hyperfocal focusing methods. Rotating the focus ring past the infinity position sets the camera to AF mode; returning to MF requires depressing a small button on the focusing tab. Twisting a third ring adjacent to the camera body sets the lens to macro mode, which reduces the minimum focus distance from 0.3m to 0.17m, and neatly slides a new distance scale into place. In macro mode the maximum aperture is limited to f/2.8. On the top plate you’ll find a shutter speed dial that’s marked in full stops from 1 second to 1/2000sec – the fastest speed available using the mechanical shutter. There’s also an A position for aperture priority or program modes. It’s possible to set intermediate shutter speeds in 1/3 stop steps, using the electronic dial placed alongside. In aperture-priority and program modes, this dial directly controls exposure compensation; pressing a large button embedded in its centre sets the ISO. When shooting in shutter priority mode, or manual with Auto ISO, you can set exposure compensation via the onscreen control panel, or assign it to the Fn button beneath the viewfinder. With the dial in the 1/2000 position it’s also possible to set electronic speeds up to 1/40,000sec, while at the other end of the scale you can use timed speeds as long as 2 minutes, along with a T (for Time) setting in manual mode. For those unfamiliar with the idea, this is like the Bulb mode found on most cameras, but better. Instead of having to keep the shutter button depressed during a long exposure, you press it once to open the shutter, and a second time to close it. The elapsed time counts up onscreen during the process. Tapping the Menu button brings up an onscreen status display, from where you can change secondary settings related to autofocus, metering, continuous shooting and the self-timer, or fire up the camera’s smartphone connectivity. A second tap of the Menu button brings up a user-customisable favourites menu, while subsequent presses enter the main menu system and cycle through its pages. Once you get used to it, this works really well. To record video you can either swipe horizontally on the touchscreen, or tap the menu button or then select the Video tab of the control panel. You’ll then see a video-optimised 16:9 preview and audio levels display, with recording activated by the shutter button. Swiping up or down on the screen enters playback. Leica offers just enough customisability to tailor the camera to your needs. In addition to the customisable Fn button, the zoom/lock button next your thumb can be re-assigned
        from digital zoom to auto-exposure or autofocus lock. It’s even possible to save up to six user profiles for different shooting scenarios, which can also be given meaningful names. Normally I’d criticise a company for removing external controls, but Leica has perfected the art of stripping a camera back the basics and leaving you with exactly what you need. Accordingly, the Q2 Monochrom makes it quick and easy to change the important exposure settings, and to move the autofocus point or focus manually if you prefer. It’s a camera that does a brilliant job of handing creative control to the photographer, as opposed to being a photo-taking gadget that wants to do everything for you. Leica Q2 Monochrom: Viewfinder and screen When it comes to composition, I suspect most photographers will use the electronic viewfinder. It’s large and sharp, with a 3.68m-dot resolution and a magnification of 0.76x. A neat dioptre adjustment knob clicks in and out of the body, allowing easy adjustment with minimal risk of accidental resetting. However I found the EVF’s corner-mounted design and minimal eyecup makes it susceptible to glare in bright light, meaning I often had to shade it with my left hand. A number of useful compositional aids can be superimposed on the live view feed, including gridlines and a virtual horizon to aid composition, along with a live histogram and clipping warnings to help avoid overexposure. The latter is especially important on Leica’s Monochrom models, as when highlight detail gets clipped, it can’t be retrieved. Below the EVF is a 3-in touchscreen that’s fixed in place, rather than articulated. Leica says this helps keep the camera robust and weather-sealed, but I suspect many photographers would favour a tilting unit on this kind of discreet street-friendly camera. Personally I rarely used the screen for composition, but instead only for changing settings and playback. The eye sensor for switching automatically between the two viewing methods offers two levels of sensitivity. Leica Q2 Monochrom: Autofocus While it’s designed to look very much like a manual-focus rangefinder, the Q2M includes a perfectly capable autofocus system based on 225 contrast detection points. It offers multi-zone, field and spot modes, with the latter allowing the AF point to be positioned almost anywhere in the scene using the d-pad. Face detection is also available, and works very well, being capable of recognising people across a wide range of distances and angles. In use the autofocus is quiet and accurate, and while it’s not the quickest I’ve ever used, it’s more than adequate for a camera with a fixed wideangle prime. It also continues to function perfectly well in extremely low light, no doubt aided by the lens’s large aperture. However, most of the time I turned off the autofocus and employed manual focusing instead. This reflects the fact that Leica has provided one of the best experiences of any camera I’ve used, which positively encourages you to manipulate the focus to match your own creative vision. Rotating the focus ring automatically engages a magnified view, upon which is superimposed a peaking display that precisely highlights those areas in sharp focus. Naturally this can be disabled it you prefer. Leica Q2  Monochrom: Performance A flick of the power switch around the shutter button brings the Q2M to life almost immediately, and in use it’s a snappy, reactive camera that does what you ask of it with the minimum of fuss. In part this is down to the analogue controls that provide a particularly quick and direct way of controlling the shutter speed, aperture and focus. However the buttons and touchscreen are also all perfectly responsive to your inputs. Operationally the camera is extremely quiet – the photographer may be able to hear the autofocus and shutter mechanisms in quiet environments, but it’s unlikely anybody else will notice. The metering is generally well judged, with a distinct tendency to protect highlights from clipping, which makes perfect sense given the sensor’s characteristics. It does mean that you’ll often get dark foregrounds in high contrast scenes as the camera seeks to retain detail in the sky, but this isn’t a problem given that the DNG raw files are extremely malleable. However if you’re aiming to share JPEG files, you’ll need to keep an eye on what the camera is doing and be prepared to apply exposure compensation when necessary. Leica Q2  Monochrom: Image quality Examining the Q2M’s image files reveals that Leica has once again delivered on the theoretical benefits of the monochrome sensor. When everything comes together properly, it’s capable of rendering exquisitely fine detail in a fashion that conventional colour sensors simply can’t match. At low ISOs, the sensor’s dynamic range is extraordinary, which means you can expose for bright highlights and then pull out detail from the deepest shadows within the raw file, without being troubled by unsightly noise. The sensor’s
        qualities also shine through as you raise the ISO. Even when examining your files close-up onscreen, you’ll see only a little noise starting to appear at ISO 3200. But because it’s pure luminance noise, all it does is add a fine grain effect, which means it’s not remotely objectionable. Indeed it’s only when you switch up to ISO 12,500 that noise starts to have a clear impact on detail, but I’d still be perfectly happy shooting ISO 25,000 as a matter of course. By ISO 50,000 shadow detail has pretty much disappeared, but images should still be quite usable with careful processing and noise reduction. I’d be inclined to avoid ISO 100,000, but that’s no great loss on a camera with an image-stabilised f/1.7 wideangle lens, as I can’t really envisage when you’d need it. I also saw some pattern noise effects in dark tones when manipulating DNG files of ISO 25,000 and higher, but it seem churlish to complain. The lens is a fine performer, resolving an impressive amount of detail in the centre of the frame at f/1.8, with a zone of critical sharpness that extends roughly to the top and bottom edges. Beyond this area sharpness tails off, with the extreme corners of the frame looking slightly low in contrast and lacking pixel-level fine detail. But you’ll only see this if you view images at 100% onscreen or make enormous prints; in real-world use, the shallow depth of field at f/1.7 is likely to have a far greater impact. As always the corners improve progressively on stopping down, giving excellent results at f/8 to f/11, which generally count as normal working apertures for full-frame anyway. However they always show just a little pixel-level softness, which probably reflects the fact that the lens’s residual lateral chromatic aberration (which can be seen on the standard Q2) can’t be corrected with a monochrome sensor. Photographers should also be aware that, like most modern lenses, this one is built around software correction for barrel distortion. Unfortunately some raw converters won’t apply this correctly, which can leave you looking at strongly curved lines where they should be straight, along with black corners to the frame. The lens is also rather prone to flare with strong light sources within the frame, such as the sun or street lamps.'

      value: Amy Davies finds out if the superzoom Nikon Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR lens is a good all-rounder investment for Nikon Z owners.
    - type: conclusion
      value: That’s not to say that the lens produces bad images – far from it – but with something like this there will always be a compromise. Having a relatively narrow aperture means that low light shooting for example might be a problem, but that might not be an issue if you’re mainly shooting in good light. It’s also arguably worth having a lens in your kit that you can use to cover off specific subjects that you might not already have something useful for – such as a long focal length for example – particularly if you don’t shoot certain subjects all that frequently, or, in the case of wildlife and sport, simply can’t afford the eye-watering price tags of other long focal length lenses in Nikon’s Z range.
    - type: excerpt
      value: Announced back in February 2020, the Nikkor Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 gives Z photographers an 8.3x zoom in a relatively lightweight and compact package. With that in mind, it’s ideally positioned as a travel lens, or any other situation where carrying multiple lenses might be unfavourable, such as for day trips and so on. The focal lengths available make it ideally suited to a diverse set of subjects, including landscapes at the wide-angle end, portraits in the middle of the range, and even wildlife and sport at its furthest reach. It’s worth noting at this point, that the 24-200mm offers the longest focal length in a lens costing under $1000 / £1000 at the time of writing. If you want to shoot wildlife and sports on a budget, this could very well be the one for you. Other options for this subject include the Nikkor Z 100-400mm f/4.5 – 5.6 VR S ($2,699 / £2,599) and the Nikkor Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S ($2,696 / £2,599). These are far superior lenses, but are more than 2.5x the price of the 24-200mm. Of course, all of this comes with a compromise, and packing a long focal length into a relatively small package means that apertures are fairly narrow. The widest available is f/4 at the wide-angle end, and which drops down to f/6.3 at the telephoto end. Still, Nikon promises that you can still achieve good bokeh and creative results with it. The Nikkor 24-200mm lens can be used with Nikon’s full-frame Z system cameras, such as the Z7 II , Z6 II or Z5 , but it’s also potentially a good pairing for the cheaper and lighter APS-C system cameras like the Z50 and the Zfc . Using it with these models gives you an equivalent focal length of 36-300mm. It’s also possible to use full-frame cameras in crop mode to give the same equivalent focal lengths – which could come in handy for subjects as wildlife. That said, there is also a dedicated DX (APS-C) format Z series superzoom lens which may be better suited for landscapes and other typical wide-angle subjects. The Nikon Nikkor 18-140mm f/3.5-6.3 VR has an equivalent focal length of 27-210mm, making it much closer to using the 24-200mm on a full-frame model. At the time of writing, there are no third-party superzoom lenses currently available directly for Z mount. This is disappointing considering there’s other mirrorless lenses such as the Tamron 28-200mm f/2.8-5.6 in E mount, but sadly Nikon is quite strict with its licensing for third-party products. An alternative potential solution if budget is tight is to go for a DSLR F-mount superzoom and use it with an adapter. For example, the Tamron 28-300mm Di VC PZD which can be picked up for roughly half the price of the Nikon Z 24-200mm. That said, having been around for quite some time, the 24-200mm can be found at good prices via second-hand retailers, too. Nikon Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR Features The Nikkor 24-200mm lens construction consists of 19 elements in 15 groups, to include two ED elements, one aspherical ED element and two aspherical elements – between them, these are designed to help reduce fringing, distortion and aberrations. Elements with an ARNEO coat work to reduce ghosting and flare, while a fluorine coated front lens elements repels dirt and water. The lens is also weather-sealed. There are seven diaphragm blades for creating out of focus areas, which is more obvious when shooting at long focal lengths. This is not designed as a macro lens, but at the mid-to telephoto end of it, you might want to use it for typical macro-type subjects such as flowers . The maximum reproduction ratio is 0.28x and the closest focusing distance (at 24mm) is 0.5m , rising to 0.7m when you’re at 200mm. This is measured from the sensor, so although you can’t get super-close to a subject, if you shoot at long focal lengths then you’ll be able to capture frame-filling shots. Stepping motors are used for autofocusing to keep things quiet, which should make it a good choice for video work. The VR in the lens name indicates that vibration reduction is included, which again is good news for shooting at long focal lengths, and for video work. Nikon Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR Build and Handling As you’d expect from a lens covering such a broad focal length, the 24-200mm isn’t exactly small, but it compacts down fairly well for transportation and when in the 24mm setting. You can engage a lock at the 24mm end to ensure that it stays packed away while in a kit bag or perhaps while it’s slung over your shoulder. Despite its size, it’s not too heavy, and balances well with models such as the Z7 II and the Z6 II. It would be a reasonable balance with smaller APS-C models, but as already mentioned, those users are better serviced by the dedicated DX superzoom optic anyway. If you perhaps have both a full-frame and APS-C body, you might consider using this for both at some point. There’s little to say about the outward design, as there are no switches for switching between AF and MF, nor turning on/off Vibration Reduction. You can control focusing
        mode from the camera’s “i” menu with cameras such as the Z7 II. Some bodies, such as the Z9 , have a dedicated button, while with other bodies you can customise a button to this function if you like. You can switch off vibration reduction via a menu setting if you wish (note, this refers to the whole system – both in-body and lens). Bear in mind, that generally it’s no longer necessary to switch off vibration reduction when using tripods, so the lack of a dedicated switch isn’t too much of an annoyance. A small ring at the base of the lens can be set to control a few functions, including aperture, exposure compensation, and manual focus. You can also set it to control absolutely nothing if you find it to be something you accidentally knock, for example. Most of the bulk of the lens is taken up by the zoom mechanism, which is marked in focal lengths of 24, 35, 50, 70, 105, 135 and 200mm. The mechanism moves just slowly enough to make precise adjustments easy, and having the markings enables quick jumping between common focal lengths. The lens can be used with 67mm filters, while a small lens hood is included which can be reversed when transporting the lens to keep size down. Nikon Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR Autofocus On the whole, the stepping motors do a good job of keeping autofocusing quick and quiet , so it’s entirely plausible that you might want to use this lens for video work. In fact, it might make a good all rounder lens for travel vloggers who want to capture a wide variety of scenes but don’t want to be weighed down with lots of different lenses. Additionally, most of the time, the lens locks on to the required subject accurately and quickly, especially so for an all-rounder lens. It can sometimes struggle a little in very low light situations , or when moving quickly between a very close subject and a distant subject , but not so much as to cause difficulties in most instances. Nikon Z 24-200mm f/4-6.3 VR Image Quality We wouldn’t expect a superzoom travel lens like this to offer unparalleled sharpness in the same league as more expensive and prime optics. However, it produces images with an overall very good impression of sharpness when viewing at normal printing and viewing sizes. The softest results can be seen at the furthest reach of the telephoto, but it’s only really if you examine closely in fine detail that you’ll find too much of a problem in most cases. This seems like a fair compromise for the versatility offered by the optic. Despite the relatively narrow aperture across the zoom range, you can still create some attractive shallow depth of field effects, particularly when shooting at the further reaches of the lens. Drop off in focus is reasonably natural and a nice softness is created. Distortion doesn’t seem to be a problem throughout the lens range, with the wider angles handled well by in-camera correction. Vignetting can be seen when shooting in some conditions at f/4 at the widest point of the lens – this is not necessarily unattractive but if you don’t like it, it can be easily removed in post-production, or vignetting reduction can be increased in camera. Chromatic aberrations don’t appear to be an issue, even when shooting in fairly high contrast situations and actively zooming into the scene to try and find them. Overall, although this is not a lens which you’ll rely on for superb sharpness, for a travel zoom, it puts in a great performance.

      value: 'The world isn’t exactly short of 50mm lenses for full frame cameras, so one might wonder whether we really need another. Sigma clearly believes we do, and has recently introduced two such lenses in quick succession – this Sigma 50mm F2 DG DN in the Contemporary series, and a 50mm F1.4 DG DN in the Art range. While at first this might seem a little excessive, on closer inspection we will see that the two lenses serve quite different purposes and are aimed at different types of user. The f/1.4 Art model is big, heavy and costs $850 / £849, while this f/2 Contemporary lens is small, half the weight and, at $639 / £619, has a somewhat more accessible price. It’s some time since I used an f/2 50mm lens, as I’m generally attracted to wider maximum apertures such as f/1.2 or f/1.4. These super-wide apertures usually come with a price premium, but 50mm f/1.8 lenses – or Niffy Fifties – are generally pretty cheap and plentiful in most mounts. It seems odd then that the model on test here stops at f/2, and comes at a more-than budget price, but I’m hoping that the compromise in the maximum aperture value pays us back in image quality when the lens is used wide open. Sigma 50mm F2 DG DN C: Features This Sigma 50mm F2 DG DN lens is designed for full frame mirrorless cameras , and sits in the range of Sigma’s Contemporary lenses along with eight other fixed focal lengths and three zooms designed for the same mounts. The prime lenses in the series stand out for their external design – nice metal barrels, metal rings and a manual aperture ring. Their relatively moderate maximum apertures all allow them to be quite compact, though their extensive use of metal means they are not as light as lenses that use modern polycarbonate bodies. So, they are small, tough and nice-looking, rather than simply small and light. The lens uses 11 elements in total and groups them into 9 clusters , with three aspherical elements and one Super Low Dispersion element in the construction. The iris is made from nine curved blades to create a rounded aperture, and the lens allows us to focus on subjects just 45cm from the camera sensor. The L-mount unit I was using measures 68mm in length and is 70mm across at its widest point – the Sony E mount version is very slightly longer – and it weighs 350g (345g in E-Mount). The lens comes with a hood and a very neat magnetic front cap that snaps into place over the front of the lens. Sigma also includes a regular plastic cap for those fearful of modern technology. The filter thread is 58mm. Sigma 50mm F2 DG DN C: Build and handling The all-metal body of the lens feels very good indeed, and the engineering is refined, neat and extremely well finished. Metal barrels can be a low-cost option for some Chinese brands with more agricultural manufacturing expertise, but here it is used to give us a quality body that suggests it will last forever rather than something that’s just big and clunky. The aperture ring makes a satisfying click as it turns, indicating to the ear as well as the finger each third-stop as it passes. Unlike with low cost lenses, the aperture positions are evenly spaced on the ring and no third-stop is missed. An unmistakable pause in clicks stands between the f/22 position and the A(uto) mark that allows the camera to take control. There is no way to de-click the aperture ring, so film makers beware, and no depth-of-field scale is present. The lack of depth-of-field markings is a result of the free-flying focus ring that responds to all the customization options offered by the Lumix cameras I used it on – change of direction, linear/non-linear response etc. A raised switch on the barrel allows us to select between manual and auto focusing, but you can also control the focus mode via the camera body without touching the switch. The lens isn’t the smallest 50mm I’ve seen but it is still pretty compact, and is blessed with one of the nicest designs I’ve seen in a modern body. It is modern, but it has enough traditional handling touches to make me feel as though I’m in control of my pictures – whether I am or not. It makes a welcome change from the featureless plastic barrels we so often see these days. Sigma 50mm F2 DG DN C: Autofocus A key feature of these DN lenses is that they are designed for mirrorless cameras and thus respond better to their focusing systems than lenses designed on the back of older DSLR models. Hence this lens has a much better AF system for the Lumix cameras than the previous Art lenses in L mount do, and I noticed immediately that the lens reacts quickly when the camera commands to it do anything. Both the standing-start time and the tracking time are much reduced. I was able to shoot subjects moving towards me and have confidence that the picture would be recorded with the focus on the subject, rather than where the subject had been a moment ago. Sigma 50mm F2 DG DN C: Image Quality When you are compromising on a really fast maximum aperture there has to
        be some pay-off, and I’d expect that in the quality of image created right across the range of f-stops. And fortunately that’s what this lens delivers. I tend to shoot wide-open a lot, so good image quality at the widest apertures, which is hardest to produce, is especially important to me. I was pleased to discover that the lens is very nicely sharp at f/2. But not only is it sharp, there is also only the very faintest hint of a very minor cyan/red chromatic fringe along high contrast edges which will only be noticed by those looking too closely. I was using the 47MP Lumix S1R, particularly to give such errors no hiding place. It’s pretty hard to say that the middle apertures produce definitively sharper and more detailed images than the widest apertures, or that the centre of the image is wholly better than the edges, as performance across the frame and the aperture range is remarkably even. In technical tests it is possible to see, when results are studied very closely, that edge performance is slightly below the detail gathering abilities of the middle of the frame – and that the performance at f/6.3 is fractionally better than at f/2 and f/16. But in practical use, I think most users will be very happy with their results no matter which aperture was used or where the subject is positioned. Some corner shading is visible in plain backgrounds when the widest aperture is used, but it isn’t serious and it disappears quickly once we close down a couple of stops. Out-of-focus highlights are pleasingly un-distracting, though perhaps not ‘creamy’, and the transition from in-focus to out-of-focus is nicely smooth. There is no noticeable curvilinear distortion to be reported, as one would hope with a ‘standard’ focal length lens.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: If you’re somebody who shoots portraits – or other subjects that call out for an 85mm lens – this f/1.2 optic from Nikon is exceptional. But, then again, for the price it absolutely should be. But it is really hard to get away from that price point. For the vast majority of photographers – certainly amateurs and enthusiasts – it will simply be too high. That’s especially true when you can get an 85mm f/1.8 lens for under £800, which will also produce excellent results. It’s also true that most will consider size and weight to be an issue, too. Whereas the f/1.8 can be carried with a variety of other lenses in a well-stocked and versatile kit bag, at over 1kg, the f/1.2 lens is not something you will want to cart around “just in case”. Overall, what we have here is the best of the best. Do you need it? Probably not – but as with other luxury items, need generally comes below want and this is hugely desirable. Start saving now.
    - type: excerpt
      value: Widely regarded as the ideal focal length for portrait photography, this Nikon Z 85mm f/1.2 S beast of a lens from Nikon is part of its f/1.2 S series of optics, which promise to deliver the absolute best in image quality, but come with a seriously hefty price tag to match its seriously hefty weight. At the time of writing, the only other f/1.2 Nikon Z optic available is the 50mm f/1.2 S, but a 35mm f/1.2 lens is reasonably likely to complete the trio at some point – though it’s worth noting that this has not been confirmed by Nikon as of yet. Nikon already has an 85mm f/1.8 lens, which has been in the Z line-up since 2019. It’s significantly cheaper than the f/1.2 version and much lighter too. But, with that extra aperture width you should expect even creamier out-of-focus areas – with Nikon claiming “special attention” was given to the rendering of bokeh during lens development, using the same philosophy as 2020’s 50mm f/1.2. Those who owned Nikon DSLRs never had the opportunity to shoot at 85mm f/1.2, since it simply wasn’t possible to make one for the small F mount. The increased width of the Z mount makes this kind of optic possible, while mirrorless focusing technology is far better suited to making sure that relevant subject details are in focus – something which is incredibly important when you’re shooting at such a shallow depth of field – get it slightly wrong and your picture is ruined. Both Canon DSLR and mirrorless owners have had access to an 85mm f/1.2 lens for some time – but the EF version was incredibly difficult to get good results due to this focusing problem. Canon’s RF (mirrorless) 85mm f/1.2 lens is roughly the same weight as Nikon’s, and has about the same diameter, but is about 24mm shorter. It’s also interesting to note that other full-frame brand owners don’t get to enjoy an 85mm f/1.2 at this point in time. While there’s a fantastic Sony FE 50mm F1.2 GM lens, or the Sigma 35mm F1.2 DG DN Art, others wanting to shoot at 85mm generally have to make do with f/1.8. As well as being highly sought after by portrait photographers, those who shoot weddings, still life, events, fashion and so on are likely to also be tempted by the 85mm f/1.2. Having that extra wide aperture comes in handy when shooting in typical low-light scenarios common with weddings and events. Whether most ordinary photographers can justify more than three times the outlay than the 85mm f/1.8 is another matter. That said, it could be a lens you choose to hire for a specific occasion or one to dream about should your lottery numbers finally come up. Nikon Z 85mm f/1.2 S Features The complex optical design of the 85mm f/1.2 lens helps to explain its high price tag – and large size. It features 15 elements in ten groups, to include one ED element to suppress colour fringing, two aspherical elements, and elements with a Nano Crystal coat for reduced ghosting, reflection and flare. There are 11 diaphragm blades which produce that lovely large and soft bokeh. Although this is a lens that you could easily use for typical macro-type subjects, such as flowers or still life, it’s not designated as a macro lens. The closest focusing distance is 0.85m (from the sensor), while the maximum reproduction ratio is 0.11x. A multi-focusing system promises fast and accurate AF performance, even when shooting at that all-important f/1.2 maximum aperture. Stepping motors (STMs) are also included, for smooth and quiet focusing operation – ideal for discreet operation in settings such as weddings, and for recording video without picking up unwanted focusing noise. Dust and drip resistance is included – as we’d expect for a lens of this specification – so those photographing events and so on outdoors can use it with confidence. Nikon Z 85mm f/1.2 S Build and Handling This is a lens which is designed definitively for full-frame models, and given its weight and heft, it’s going to feel lens heavy on whatever you use it on – even the largest camera in the line-up, the Z 9. I used it with the Z 7II for best resolution and you just have to learn to accept that this is a heavy and awkward lens. It’s not impossible to use the 85mm f/1.2 with one of Nikon’s APS-C models, such as the Z fc or the Z 50, but it would likely be incredibly cumbersome and would seem like an odd choice for the typical APS-C user. The outward design of the 85mm f/1.2 departs a little from the 50mm f/1.2 in that it doesn’t have the same inbuilt OLED display. Perhaps this would have added even more bulk to a lens which at 1160g is already enough to cause back strain. Alternatively, perhaps Nikon simply decided that the feature wouldn’t really be missed. At the base of the lens, there’s a switch for moving between auto and manual focus, while manual focusing itself can be controlled via the large focusing ring towards the front of the lens. There are no hard stops at either end of the ring but there is a satisfying amount of give here to help with precise manual focusing.
        If you’re shooting at very wide apertures, then it’s likely to be helpful to switch on on-screen or in-viewfinder assistance, such as focus peaking. There are two customisable controls on the 85mm f/1.2. An L-Fn button just behind the focusing ring can be set to control a large number of functions such as AF-ON, depth of field preview, metering and more. You can also set it to control nothing if you’re worried about catching it accidentally. A small ring towards the base of the lens can be set to control aperture, exposure compensation or ISO. Again, it can also be set to do absolutely nothing, too. Included in the box is the HB-106 lens hood . Unsurprisingly this is very large and adds significant length to the overall lens. It can be reversed when not in use however to save space. Autofocus on the Nikon Z 85mm f/1.2 In the vast majority of situations, focusing is very quick , and importantly very quiet , which is great news for video recording. For £3,000 we’d expect nothing less, but it’s still good to have that confirmed. When shooting portraits it’s likely advisable to switch on eye-detect A F, which is available for both human and animal subjects. Then you can be assured that the point of focus in the frame will keep up even if (when) the subject moves. Remembering that even slight movements at f/1.2 or even f/1.4 or f/1.8 could result in completely missed focus. With the Z 7II, eye-detect coped extremely well and it was incredibly rare for it to miss. With the Z 9, the performance was arguably even better – picking up and locking on quickly to even a difficult subject (a black dog with dark eyes) running towards the lens with ease. Image Quality of the Nikon Z 85mm f/1.2 It’s safe to say that the images produced by the 85mm f/1.2 are exceptional. Again, this is exactly what you’d expect from a £3,000 lens and anything less than that would have been disappointing. Using it with the 45-megapixel Z7 II shows of its fantastic ability to resolve fine details, which when you examine closely really sing from the screen. Sharpness is excellent throughout the aperture range. I was interested to compare the differences between shooting with the 85mm f/1.2 and the f/1.8 lens, so I shot the same scene with both lenses on several occasions. While the f/1.8 is a fine lens, also capable of producing excellent results, the f/1.2 is noticeably better – from providing an extra level of sharpness to a smoother and more attractive background blur (even when shooting f/1.8 with both lenses). That said, the differences are perhaps only really apparent when comparing the same subject like for like, and existing 85mm f/1.8 lens owners probably shouldn’t feel disheartened. Whether that’s worth the astronomical price tag is a question that can only be fully answered by the individual concerned. For professional photographers or dedicated portrait shooters, the answer may well be yes, while for everybody else, it might just be the type of lens you lust over but can never truly justify. To go back to bokeh, shooting at f/1.2 produces some incredibly beautiful results, with deliciously smooth out-of-focus areas that will surely make anybody fall in love with the lens. It also produces excellent results at other wide apertures, including f/1.4 and f/2.8. As we’d expect from a lens at this focal length, there’s no obvious distortion on display , while other problems such as chromatic aberration and flare also are completely absent. Even vignetting at the widest f/1.2 aperture isn’t overly problematic, only being visible in certain circumstances and something which can be easily corrected if you don’t like it. In short, this is a lens which displays the highest optical excellence.

      value: Amy Davies discovers whether this ultra-slim Nikon Nikkor Z 26mm f/2.8 prime lens for Nikon Z camera is worth the cost
    - type: conclusion
      value: It’s fair to say that the Nikon 26mm f/2.8 is capable of producing some great images. Results are sharp, there’s little distortion or chromatic aberration and although vignetting does appear in certain situations, it’s not displeasing. However, the same could also be said of other lenses, particularly the 28mm f/2.8 which offer very similar specifications in a package – albeit a bigger one – at half the price. The slowness and noisiness of the autofocus mechanism is disappointing too, especially for one which is touted for its discreetness and street work. It’s easy to imagine missing certain shots by the time it’s caught up. Video work is likely to be marred too, which is a shame for vloggers who might otherwise appreciate the reasonably wide angle. Overall, the 26mm is a bit of a confusing lens. 26mm feels like an odd focal length for most photographers. It’s not wide enough to be “ultra wide”, and it’s not narrow enough to be commonly used for street photography and the like – except perhaps for APS-C users where the 39mm equivalent focal length is a bit more usual. But, for that kind of user, the price is likely to be too much. If you’re looking for a wide angle prime lens, it’s difficult to recommend this over other cheaper optics, unless you’re particularly desperate to have something which is so small and lightweight. While Nikon might have proved just how slim a full-frame lens can be with this, for most ordinary users, the 28mm is simply a better bet. If the price comes down dramatically in the coming months / years, it may be worth reconsidering.
    - type: excerpt
      value: The primary selling point of the new Nikon Z 26mm f/2.8 pancake lens from Nikon is its incredibly small size. At just 23.5mm in length, it’s the slimmest AF lens for full-frame Nikon mirrorless cameras available , and at just 125g it’s barely noticeable in your kit bag – or even your pocket. This makes it appealing as a walk-around camera for subjects such as street photography where discreetness is welcomed, but also with its wide angle, landscapes and architecture are also obvious typical subjects. All that said, it’s a bit oddly positioned in the current Nikon Z line-up , with it not providing too much that you can’t pick up elsewhere for better value. For example, there’s already a 28mm f/2.8 lens, which you can pick up for less than half the price of the 26mm. Admittedly, it’s not a pancake lens, but it’s still pretty small (43mm / 170g), so unless you’re desperately craving that extra 2mm of width, it’s perhaps hard to see the 26mm appealing too much – unless it dramatically comes down price. Although it’s designed as a full-frame lens, it can also be used on Nikon’s APS-C mirrorless cameras, such as the Z50 , Z30 , or the Zfc . Here, it’s arguably a better match to the small size of such models, while giving a 39mm equivalent focal length which may be more appreciated by street photographers , too. Again though, it’s probably a bit expensive for that kind of user – who can again pick up the 28mm and enjoy a reasonably close 42mm equivalent. Nikon Z 26mm f/2.8 Features The optical design of this lens includes eight elements in is groups, including three aspherical elements. There are seven diaphragm blades. This is not designated as a macro lens, and the closest focusing ability is 0.2m. While that’s reasonably close for most subjects – especially at a wide angle) – it’s not something you’re going to be able to use for frame-filling subjects. Depending on the context you can on occasion create detail shots with a blurred background. The magnification ratio is 0.19x. Despite its small size and light weight, Nikon hasn’t scrimped on including a metal mount, while the lens barrel and all moving parts are sealed against dust and water droplets. Video shooters and vloggers may find the focal length useful, especially for shooting to camera in relatively small spaces. Remembering of course that if you use it with an APS-C camera, a 1.5x crop will be applied. We’ll touch on video recording with the lens later in the review. Nikon Z 26mm f/2.8 Build and Handling As already mentioned, the Nikkor 26mm f/2.8 is incredibly small and lightweight. You can easily hold it in the palm of your hand, so slipping it into a pocket is very much a possibility if you just want to grab an extra lens while out and about – particularly if it complements whatever else you happen to be shooting with. I used the 26mm f/2.8 with both the Z6 II and the Z7 II, which share a body design. The lens is very small on these bodies, perhaps making it feel a little grip-heavy if you’re used to shooting with heavier lenses most of the time. You get used to this after a while though. Although I haven’t tried it with an APS-C body, I imagine with the Z50 or the Zfc it would be an excellent match for the smaller body shape. When focusing, the inner barrel will poke out from the centre of the lens as you reach the minimum focusing distance, while at infinity focus, it’s completely contained within the lens housing. Unsurprisingly, the outward design of the lens is very minimalist. There is a manual focusing ring at the front of the lens, taking up about half of the overall size of the unit. It doesn’t have hard stops at either end, but there is a decent amount of resistance to help with making precise, small adjustments to manual focus. If you’d prefer, you can use this ring as a control ring, setting it to adjust ISO, aperture, exposure compensation or switching between manual and autofocus settings. You’ll need to head into the camera’s settings to assign it to a specific function. Setting it up to adjust aperture is potentially a good option for street photographers who want to make quick settings changes on the fly, for example. There’s no manual focus switch on the lens, so having the control ring set to switch between manual and autofocus might be a good, quick workaround if you’re somebody that likes to frequently switch between the two. Otherwise you can set to MF via the quick menu accessed via the “i” button on the back of the camera. Supplied in the box is a lens hood (HB-111), which adds a little length to the overall size of the lens, bringing it closer in size to the 28mm f/2.8 lens. You’ll need to attach the lens hood if you want to use filters, as it’s this which they attach to. Autofocus Focusing in good light is reasonably quick, though we’ve seen much quicker performances from other lenses in the Nikkor range – including from the 28mm. In other circumstances, such as low light or if you’re attempting to switch from close
        focus to distant focus, it can be slower than is preferable and could even lead to some missed shots, particularly in rapidly evolving situations, such as street photography. Another negative here is the volume of the focusing mechanism, which is noticeably audible, especially in reasonably quiet conditions and when the lens has to work to achieve focus. It’s difficult for this reason to recommend the lens for video work, as unless you’re recording audio at a distance from the lens, you’re very likely to pick up unwanted focusing noise in your recordings. Nikon Z 26mm f/2.8 Image Quality Although it’s perhaps difficult to spot too many use cases for a lens like this, one suggestion is that if you’re otherwise shooting with an all-rounder lens like the 24-70mm f/4 or 24-200mm f/4-6.3 and want something which is wide angle but also offers a wider aperture, and is a little sharper. Using the 26mm f/2.8 on the 45 megapixel Z7 II shows off that it’s capable of producing some very pleasingly sharp results. Sharpness is very good at the maximum aperture of f/2.8, but it’s a little sharper – if you’re examining very closely – at f/5.6. Across all of the apertures, the overall impression of sharpness is very good if you’re printing or viewing at normal sizes. There’s little to no chromatic aberration present in the vast majority of shots, even when shooting in high-contrast situations. Distortion is kept under control well by the in-camera distortion correction. If you switch this off, you’ll see some noticeable distortion, so it’s best to leave it on. Some vignetting can be seen when shooting at f/2.8 in certain conditions – such as when shooting blue skies. Some may find this to be quite a pleasing effect, but if you don’t, it’s easily corrected in post-production, or you can shoot at a narrower aperture, where it becomes much less noticeable at f/4 and beyond. You can also adjust the in-camera vignette correction from the normal setting to High for a better performance in camera. The seven-bladed diaphragm produces some pleasing out of focus areas (bokeh), with a natural drop off from the main subject, and the possibility to create some close-ups with an attractively blurred background.

      value: Is Sigma’s new designed-for-mirrorless fast prime a worthy successor to its ground-breaking predecessor? Andy Westlake finds out in our Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art review
    - type: conclusion
      value: Sigma’s follow-up to its revered 50mm F1.4 DG HSM Art was always going to have a lot to live up to. Thankfully, though, the new lens doesn’t disappoint. Compared to its predecessor, the Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art gains some welcome new features, most notably weather-sealing and an aperture ring. Optically it maintains the excellence that we’ve come to expect from the firm’s Art line-up, with its only slight flaw being colour fringing at large apertures. Physically it’s now lighter, if a little longer; however, it’s noticeably heftier than its E-mount rivals. Videographers should also be aware of its focus breathing. For L-mount users, the Sigma lens is likely to find favour simply because it’s smaller and much more affordable than the Panasonic (or Leica) alternative. But in E-mount, it doesn’t quite have things all its own way. Sony’s FE 50mm F1.4 GM is more expensive but practically flawless, which means it will appeal to photographers who want the best regardless of price. Meanwhile Samyang provides an impressive, budget-friendly option in the shape of the AF 50mm F1.4 FE II . Sigma’s offering sits neatly between these in terms of price and features, but it doesn’t quite deliver a knockout blow to either. As a result, the Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art isn’t necessarily the same automatic recommendation as the DSLR lens was in 2014. However, it’s still a very fine lens with a compelling blend of features. For many full-frame mirrorless users, it’s likely to represent a sweet spot of optical quality, usability, and price.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'When Sigma released its 50mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art for full-frame DSLRs back in 2014, it redefined our expectations of how large-aperture primes could perform. By using a large, complex optical design, it delivered stunning levels of sharpness that had never previously been seen from lens of its type, and rapidly became considered a modern classic. Now we have a DN version that’s specifically designed for mirrorless cameras, the Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN | Art . It’s fair to say that expectations are high. Compared to its illustrious predecessor, the DN version sports an all-new design . Alongside completely revamped optics, it gains additional controls, including an AFL button and an aperture control ring. Physically it’s lighter but a little longer, and it now boasts weather sealed construction. It’s available in Sony E and L mounts. With its 50mm focal length, this is a general-purpose optic that’s suited to a wide range of subjects. It’s f/1.4 maximum aperture makes it particularly well suited for shooting in low light, or in situations when you wish to isolate your subject against a blurred background. At $849 / £849, the Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art is considerably more affordable than either the Sony FE 50mm F1.4 GM ($1300 / £1499) or the Panasonic Lumix S Pro 50mm F1.4 ($2300 / £2000), and it’s not much more expensive than the Samyang AF 50mm F1.4 FE II ($749 / £599). On paper, it surpasses the Samyang thanks to its dedicated aperture ring, and offers broadly similar features to the Sony and Lumix lenses. So could this be the best-buy ‘fast fifty’ for full-frame mirrorless users? Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art: Features Sigma has built the 50mm F1.4 DG DN using an optical design with 14 elements in 11 groups , including one Super-Low Dispersion (SLD) glass element and three aspherical elements to suppress aberrations. The aperture diaphragm employs 11 curved blades with the aim of delivering attractive bokeh, while Sigma’s Super Multi-Layer Coating suppresses flare and ghosting. A High Response Linear Actuator (HLA) drives the focusing, with the minimum focus distance of 45cm providing a rather modest 0.15x magnification. A deep petal-shaped lens hood is provided, with a large locking button to prevent it falling off accidentally, while filter users are catered for by a 72mm thread . The lens is fully compatible with in-camera aberration correction settings, and Sigma advises enabling all of them (which is generally good advice). Like other 50mm F1.4 lenses, there’s no optical stabilisation. Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art: Build and Handling We’ve become accustomed to modern large aperture primes being rather large and heavy, and that’s very much the case here. At 78mm in diameter, 110mm in length, and 670g in weight, the Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN is at least rather lighter than both its DSLR predecessor (815g), and the huge Lumix S Pro 50mm F1.4 (955g). However, it’s somewhat heftier than its aforementioned Sony and Samyang equivalents, which weigh 516g and 420g respectively. So for E-mount users, it’s not the best choice if you wish to pack light. I tested the lens on the 60MP Sony Alpha 7R IV , and that weight is definitely noticeable. Of course, normally you’ll just support the lens with your left hand, but it’s a bit of strain if you try to shoot one-handed. There’s nothing to question in terms of build quality, though, with the plastic barrel feeling solid and robust. A rubber ‘O’ ring around the metal mount is just the most visible of the multiple seals Sigma has included to protect against dust and rain. At the front of the lens, there’s a large focus ring that rotates smoothly with no end stops. A switch on the side of the barrel selects between auto and manual focusing. As usual, turning the focus ring can automatically engage magnified view for the most accurate results. There’s also an AFL button, whose default function is to lock autofocus, but which can be reconfigured from the camera menu. The aperture ring clicks in third-stop increments from f/1.4 to f/16, with just the right amount of resistance. Alternatively, a switch on the lower left of the barrel sets the ring to smooth operation, which is usually preferred for video. Beyond the f/16 mark there’s an A position, which allows aperture setting to be transferred to a control dial on the camera body. A small switch on the lower right of the barrel allows you to lock the aperture ring either into, or out of its A position. A few small but thoughtful features further improve the shooting experience. A large, ridged grip on the fixed section of the barrel aids with mounting and removing the lens from the camera, while white inlays on the switches provide a quick visual indication of their positions. Overall, I found the Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN a pleasure to use, despite its weight. Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art: Autofocus Turning our attention to autofocus , the lens acquits itself well. It’s not the fastest in the world – 50mm f/1.4s never are – but it
        should be quick enough to handle most of the purposes for which it’s likely to be used. It’s also very quiet. I saw no clear evidence of misfocusing among the hundreds of sample images I shot for this review, however depth-of-field is extremely narrow at the largest apertures, so you do have to be extremely careful about where you place the focus point. Likewise, manual focus works well when you need it. The focus ring offers just the right level of resistance to enable accurate control, while a scale in the viewfinder shows the current focus distance. Videographers should be aware, though, that the lens exhibits visible focus breathing, with the angle of view narrowing at closer distances. This is one area where Sony’s FE 50mm F1.4 GM has an advantage, as it’s compatible with the breathing compensation function on recent Sony cameras. Samyang’s AF 50mm F1.4 FE II also has minimal breathing. Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN Art: Image quality Given its heritage, it should come as no surprise to find that the Sigma 50mm F1.4 DG DN | Art delivers impressive image quality, even when tested with the Sony A7R IV’s 60MP sensor. In fact, it’s impressively sharp all the way across the frame with the aperture wide open. Stop down to its sharpest apertures around f/5.6 to f/8, and even the pickiest of pixel peepers should be happy when examining images at 100% onscreen. A little pixel-level blurring does become visible at f/11 and beyond, due to diffraction. But I still wouldn’t hesitate to use the lens’s f/16 minimum aperture in situations where depth-of-field is paramount. If you use the lens as it’s intended, with software corrections enabled, it delivers geometrically correct images . However, if you make the mistake of turning off in-camera distortion compensation, you’ll see quite pronounced pincushion distortion, with inward pinching of straight lines along the edge of the frame. Adobe has a correction profile available for the lens, so when you open raw files in Lightroom or Camera Raw, they’ll match the corrected JPEGs perfectly. Turning our attention to vignetting , this again is normally suppressed by Sony cameras, in both JPEG and raw files. Disable the in-camera compensation, and you’ll see quite strong corner darkening at large apertures. But the falloff profile is gradual, making it far from unattractive, and I’d be tempted to exploit this natural vignetting for aesthetic effect. If the lens has any kind of optical flaw, it lies with longitudinal chromatic aberration . At the largest apertures, green and magenta fringing can be visible around high-contrast edges that are slightly out-of-focus, when examining your images close-up onscreen. This kind of fringing can’t be so readily addressed by in-camera software corrections, so it’s present in both JPEG and raw files. But it’s reasonably easy to clear up using Adobe’s Defringe controls when necessary, and it also disappears on stopping down to f/2. Below, you can see 100% crops that illustrate the effect of applying the requisite corrections to the image above, successfully suppressing the worst of the effect. In contrast, lateral chromatic aberration shouldn’t be a problem, as it’s corrected automatically both in-camera and in raw processing. If for some reason you switch off the camera’s Chromatic Aberration Comp setting, you might see a little colour fringing towards the corners of the frame. But again, there’s no sensible reason not to leave this set to Auto. I saw no real problem with flare when shooting directly into the sun, which is impressive for a large-aperture prime. Stop the aperture down to f/11 or f/16, and you can induce well-defined sunstars . However, with 22 rays courtesy of the 11-bladed aperture, they look rather fussy. Naturally, with its f/1.4 aperture, the lens can deliver attractively blurred backgrounds . Thanks to the circular aperture, the effect remains pleasant on stopping down to f/4, at least. When using large apertures in bright light, though, it’s crucial to disable the camera’s electronic front curtain shutter setting and use the mechanical shutter instead. Otherwise, as is visible in the comparison above, bokeh discs can become truncated vertically at shutter speeds faster than 1/2000sec, which results in distinctly ugly-looking backgrounds. This isn’t a flaw with the lens – it affects all fast primes.'

      value: The Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f1.7 II remains unchallenged as a bright 20mm pancake lens for Micro Four Thirds - but how does it perform?
    - type: conclusion
      value: The Panasonic Lumix 20mm f/1.7 lens definitely stacks up, with very sharp results, but there are areas where it could also be better. Focus is slow and always has been with this lens, making it a poor choice for video work. It’s got a certain charm to it, and delivers sharp images, with the occasional “optical flaw” that give your images extra style, with vignetting and flare at times. You can avoid these by stopping down the lens, or adding a lens hood, but then you lose some of the charm, and some of the benefits of the compact size.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f1.7 II ASPH lens has been around for a while now, but is it still a good buy for Micro Four Thirds users? At a glance: The Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f/1.7 II ASPH lens is a compact pancake lens for Micro Four Thirds users that gives a 40mm equivalent , and a relatively bright aperture of f/1.7. It’s been my go-to lens for many years now, but does it still stack up or could it be better? It’s a great choice for those looking for a compact lens that can be used anywhere, and with a brighter aperture than most zoom lenses, it can be used in a variety of situations including in low-light photography , or for general shooting. Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f1.7 II Key Features Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f1.7 II Build and Handling The redesigned lens features a mostly metal build, and you’ll be hard pressed to work out how the lens manages to be so lightweight, although the lack of a rubber seal on the rear is one area where weight (and cost) savings have been made. The lens weighs an incredible 87g, and this can make your Micro Four Thirds camera much more pocketable. If you combine this lens with a rangefinder camera like the Panasonic Lumix GX80 or Olympus PEN-F, then you end up with a camera that’s similar in size to some compact cameras (like the X100V). There’s a good sized focus ring that protrudes from the lens, and when using manual focus, this uses an electronic (focus by wire) system, meaning that the focus adjustment can be adjust quickly or slowly depending on how quickly you turn the focus ring. Auto-Focus Focus is slow whether you’re using a Panasonic or Olympus camera, and unfortunately Panasonic has not improved the focus speeds with this version compared to the original. Much of the slowness is due to the construction of the lens, and this is still the same as the first version of the lens. In a quiet room you can audibly hear the lens as it focuses, and the front of the lens moves noticeably when hunting for focus, for example when there’s nothing of contrast to latch onto. Panasonic Lumix G 20mm f1.7 II Performance and Image Quality Sharpness is generally excellent with incredibly crisp, sharp and detailed images, even from wide-open at f/1.7 aperture. Absolute sharpness does drop off towards the edges when using brighter apertures. Vignetting is visible at times, particularly when shooting at open apertures of f/1.7 or similar, but stop down and this quickly goes. Flare – You can reduce the likelihood of flare with an optional lens hood if you want, and a simple step-up ring could be used here, as I have. With a step-up from 46mm to 49mm this not only gives you more compatibility with the common filter size of 49mm, but it also adds a little bit of protection from incidental light, as well as helping protect the front lens element. Bokeh (or background blur) – With an f1.7 aperture, and close focusing available, this lens is capable of producing high levels of bokeh, that is both smooth and pleasing to see. The 7 aperture blades use a circular aperture diaphragm. With no optical image stabilisation (OIS) you’ll benefit by using this lens with a camera that has built-in in-body image stabilisation (IBIS). Luckily most Micro Four Thirds cameras now feature IBIS. Distortion is nothing to worry about, as it is automatically corrected in-camera on any Panasonic and Olympus camera, as well as being automatically corrected in raw conversion software. Q. Panasonic lens on Olympus cameras – why is there purple fringing? Chromatic aberration and purple fringing is more apparent when used on Olympus cameras, but for the most part this isn’t a major problem and can easily be corrected in photo editing software . It’s most noticeable in very strong areas of contrast, as shown in these crops: Panasonic camera used on the left, Olympus on the right, top images show crops from JPEG, underneath the raw images processed in Adobe Camera Raw – the Panasonic image is automatically corrected in ACR, while the Olympus image needs purple fringing correction to be switched on manually. You’ll also notice longitudinal chromatic aberration in photos, and this is more noticeable in photos taken at brighter apertures, such as f/1.7. Value for money and alternatives There are other pancake lenses to consider, including the tiny Panasonic Lumix G 14mm f/2.5 ($229/£229), or Olympus M. Zuiko 17mm f2.8 (now discontinued), but nothing else is quite like the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 in terms of being a tiny pancake lens with a bright aperture. If you did want a similar focal length, there is the more the expensive OM System M.Zuiko 20mm F1.4 PRO lens ($649/£649) which is noticeably larger, or there’s also the Olympus 17mm f/1.8 lens ($399/£399) that is relatively compact, but not quite a pancake lens. If you already have the earlier version then there’s no reason to switch to this newer version as the only difference is a reduction in weight (87g vs 100g), as well as cosmetic changes, with the newer lens being
        available in black or silver. The optical formula is identical.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Tamron has a lot of experience in making superzoom lenses, and the 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III is a good example of the genre. It’s compact, nicely made and autofocuses well. As usual for this kind of optic it’s something of a compromise, with perfectly decent image quality at wider settings, but slightly less satisfactory results at the long end. Combined with its slow maximum aperture at telephoto, this means that if you expect to shoot distant subjects a lot – sports or wildlife , perhaps – a telezoom would be a better choice. The lack of optical image stabilisation may keep costs down, but it means some users of Panasonic mirrorless cameras who don’t have IBIS to rely on may encounter camera shake at the long end of the zoom. Overall, though, there’s no denying this lens’s appeal as an all-in-one travel lens – the combination of long zoom range and decent close focusing gives huge compositional flexibility. Most importantly, it also offers decent results at an attractive price.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III at a glance: Over the past decade, mirrorless cameras have dramatically changed the landscape in the photographic equipment market. The likes of Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, Olympus, Panasonic and Sony have built up compelling alternatives for photographers fed up of dealing with the size and weight of DSLRs, but unwilling to sacrifice image quality. Third-party lens manufacturers were initially cautious about producing their own mirrorless lenses, but now there’s a wide selection available, which continues to grow. Users of Panasonic and Olympus mirrorless cameras are well catered for when it comes to lenses. For more options have a look at the best Micro Four Thirds lenses. Those looking for a lens that balances good performance with excellent value for money may wish to consider the alternatives from the likes of Sigma and Tamron first. The 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III – which is the lens on test here presents an attractive saving over other long-range superzooms such as the Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 14-150mm f/3.5-5.6 II ($739/£599) and Panasonic Lumix G Vario 14-140mm f/3.5-5.6 O.I.S. ($764/£619). What’s the catch? Unlike Olympus and Panasonic’s offerings, the Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III doesn’t include weatherproofing or optical stabilisation. So why even consider the Tamron you might ask. Well, it comes back to price. Micro Four Thirds users who want a flexible all-in-one travel lens and expect to use it in benign conditions, on paper it offers the best value. With a practical 28-300mm equivalent zoom range, it’s suitable for shooting a huge range of subjects, plus it’s extremely compact (80.4×63.5mm) and incredibly lightweight (295g). Before studying how the lens performs optically let’s take a closer look over the Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III’s key features. Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III review: Features Comprising 17 elements in 13 groups and including one low-dispersion glass element, two anomalous dispersion glass elements, two glass-moulded aspherical elements and one hybrid aspherical element, the 14-150mm has the most complex optical design among Micro Four Thirds superzoom lenses. In principle, this should help reduce the optical aberrations to which lenses with such an ambitious zoom range tend to be prone. Despite all this glass, the 14-150mm is surprisingly compact, with a barrel diameter of 63.5mm and a length of 80.4mm from the mount to the front of the non-rotating 52mm filter thread. In context, it’s smaller than Olympus’s budget M.Zuiko Digital 40-150mm f/4-5.6 telezoom and barely larger than 18-55mm kit zooms for APS-C DSLRs. At 285g it’s not especially heavy, either. I’m pleased to say the lens is supplied with a bayonet-fitting petal-type plastic lens hood. Even better, it reverses neatly when not in use, fitting closely around the barrel. Packing up small is a real asset for this kind of travel lens. Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III review: Build and handling When I first unboxed the 14-150mm, I was pleased to find that it doesn’t feel cut-price at all. With a metal outer barrel and rear mount it comes across as gratifyingly well made – an impression reinforced by the smooth rotation of the zoom and focus rings. The switch for locking the zoom at its wideangle position is somewhat small and fiddly, but I found it to be superfluous anyway, as the lens isn’t at all susceptible to zoom creep (extending or retracting under its own weight). When you turn on the camera, the lens makes a disconcerting rattling noise, which appears to be the aperture diaphragm going through a start-up cycle. My sample had an attractive black paint finish with a contrasting silver ring next to the mount; a silver version is also available. The understated white barrel lettering makes the lens look classier than the gold markings used on older Tamron designs. One minor criticism is that both the front and rear lens caps are quite thick, while in contrast both Olympus and Panasonic use slender designs to maximise the size advantage of Micro Four Thirds. It’s fair to say this lens is much better suited to some Micro Four Thirds cameras than others. Long lenses such as this tend to work better on cameras that have eye-level viewfinders, as this enables a more stable shooting stance. Its maximum aperture in the telephoto range is also decidedly slow (ranging from f/5.2 at 50mm to f/5.8 at 150mm), and this means that if you use it on a Panasonic body without in body image stabilisation (IBIS), you’ll need either lots of light or high ISO settings to achieve the high shutter speeds needed to avoid blur from handshake. The upshot is that while the Tamron works particularly well on Olympus’s OM-D cameras and Panasonic Micro Four Thirds mirrorless cameras that feature in-body image stabilisation, it’s poorly suited for use on small bodies without viewfinders, such as Panasonic’s GF series. Indeed, most Panasonic owners would be better served by the company’s optically
        stabilised Lumix G Vario 14-140mm f/3.5-5.8 OIS – a lens that was updated in 2019, adding a degree of splash and dust resistance. Meanwhile, Olympus owners who often shoot in wet conditions should take a look at the weather-sealed M.Zuiko Digital ED 14-150mm f/4-5.6 II. Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III review: Focusing With a stepper motor employed to drive the focus group, the Tamron autofocuses silently and accurately. The slow maximum aperture at the telephoto end means it will often be rather slow when focusing in low light, but in daylight it’s pretty snappy. Manual focusing works well, and the camera’s focusing aids engage automatically when the focus ring is turned. With a minimum focus distance of 50cm, the lens is capable of impressive close-ups. Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III review: Image Quality Conventional wisdom tends to state that superzoom lenses of this type are all about convenience and give inferior results to pairing standard and telephoto zooms. But the reality is a bit more complicated than that. In fact, the 14-150mm is pretty sharp towards the wide end of its range (although it’s noticeably soft in the corners at 14mm), giving comparable or better results compared with the 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 kit zooms supplied with many Micro Four Thirds cameras. However, as you zoom beyond 50mm it gets progressively weaker, and at the long end it’s noticeably soft, rendering little in the way of really fine detail. But with careful shooting and processing it’s still good enough for a nice 12x8in print. One advantage of mirrorless systems is the ability to integrate software distortion correction into the lens design. This means that images contain none of the disturbing barrel distortion at wideangle that plagues superzoom lenses for DSLRs. Unusually for Micro Four Thirds, however, there is visible pincushion distortion at focal lengths longer than about 25mm (that is, 50mm equivalent), which is most pronounced around the 50mm setting. This is disappointing for JPEG users, although it’s easily corrected when processing raw. Most Micro Four Thirds cameras also have the ability to correct lateral chromatic aberration in software. Unfortunately, the Tamron 14-150mm doesn’t play nicely in this regard, meaning that if you look at your images closely you’ll see unsightly green and magenta fringing towards the corners of the frame in your JPEGs that’s most pronounced towards the extremes of the zoom range. However, this can also be cleaned up easily enough if you shoot raw. Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III review: Resolution, shading and distortion Resolution Examining the MTF readings from our Applied Imaging tests, we see that the lens gives sharp results in the centre of the frame at 14mm, although the corners are weak. Zoom in to 50mm and sharpness is still very acceptable, becoming more even across the frame. However, at 150mm, images are noticeably softer. Best results are generally obtained at f/5.6-8. Shading Not surprisingly for a complex lens in a compact package, the 14-150mm gives noticeable vignetting at the extremes of its zoom range. But it’s not overly intrusive and in effect disappears when the aperture is closed down a stop. Overall, there’s little to worry about. Curvilinear distortion Thanks to Micro Four Thirds’ integration of software distortion correction, users should see perfectly corrected images at 14mm, with no visible barrel distortion. Elsewhere in the range, however, pincushion distortion is evident even in JPEG files, being strongest around the 50mm position.'

      value: For many photographers the standard lens is probably the most important optic they will ever buy. Andy Westlake gets to grips with a mid-range, weather-sealed Panasonic standard zoom vying for your cash
    - type: conclusion
      value: There’s much to like about the Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS. It is a lightweight, versatile, carry-everywhere lens for Micro Four Thirds and its weather resistance build gives it an extra appeal to photographers who like to shoot in poor weather. It handles well and the Power OIS is a benefit too. Optically, it’s a competent mid-range zoom with a useful focal length range and suits cameras such as the Lumix G80 and GX8 , and it churns out respectable image quality shot after shot. Really, it can only be improved upon by investing in the much more costly f/2.8 standard zooms from Panasonic and OM System. In that context, the Lumix G Vario 12-60mm f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS can be recommended if you want a capable all-round standard zoom without breaking the bank.
    - type: excerpt
      value: "Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm  f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS review: Introduction The standard lens is the most important lens in any camera system because it’s the one most often bought with the camera, and many users might not go any further. Whatever the case, it needs to deliver a quality performance to tempt users to invest in the system further. Standard lenses can be primes (fixed focal length) or zoom and the latter are certainly the more popular. Panasonic has an impressive array of both types on offer. Also, with OM System (formerly Olympus Cameras) fully committed to the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) format and with independent brands including Sigma and Voigtlander involved, the choice of standard lenses is extensive. The Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS tested here is just one current option. If compactness is a quality you want then look at the Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS and this pancake-type lens costs $329-398/£349. Other similarly priced lenses include the Lumix G Vario 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 II Asph Mega OIS at $220-270 used/£329 and the Lumix G Vario 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 Asph Mega OIS priced at $175-190 used/£349. With more money to spend you could go for the higher spec Leica DG Vario-Elmarit 12-60mm f/2.8-4 Asph Power OIS at $898/£800. Again, with a decent budget the Leica DG Vario-Elmarit 12-35mm f/2.8 Asph Power OIS at $898/£879 and Panasonic Lumix G X Vario 12-35mm f/2.8 II ASPH Power OIS priced at $698/£799, also come into the reckoning although with a shorter zoom range. To help, AP has collated a list of the Best Micro Four Thirds lenses in 2023 and you can find it here . Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm  f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS review: Features With an optical formula of 11 elements in nine groups, the lens uses a construction that’s more complex than basic kit zooms. It includes three aspherical elements and one made of extra-low dispersion (ED) glass, which together reduce optical aberrations such as distortion, spherical aberration and colour fringing due to chromatic aberration. As usual from Panasonic, optical image stabilisation is built in. The lens is also designed for HD video recording, with silent autofocus and aperture mechanisms. The aperture itself is formed from seven rounded blades and features stepless adjustment, to eliminate sudden brightness jumps in movie footage. A bayonet-fitting petal-type lens hood is included in the box, and reverses snugly around the barrel for transport, while the filter thread accepts relatively petite 58mm accessories and doesn’t rotate on focusing. One handy feature is the minimum focus distance of just 25cm at the telephoto end. This gives 0.54x equivalent magnification, meaning that the lens can fill the frame with a subject measuring 6.4×4.8cm. It can be useful for shooting close-up images of subjects such as flowers and insects. Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm  f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS review: Build and handling At 71mm long, 66mm in diameter and weighing just 210g, Panasonic’s 12-60mm lens is very similar in size to the basic 18-55mm kit zooms commonly supplied with DSLRs. Its light weight reflects the predominantly plastic exterior, although the lens mount is metal. A rubber seal surrounds it, to help keep dust and water out of the camera. Design-wise, the barrel is very simple. The broad zoom ring rotates 90° from wideangle to telephoto, and is smooth enough to provide precise framing. In front of it the narrow manual-focus ring provides control by wire, with no change in feel as it passes the focus group’s end stops. However, I suspect few users will disengage autofocus anyway, as there’s very little incentive to do so. Indeed, there are no physical switches on the lens barrel, with both AF and OIS are controlled solely through the camera’s menus. Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm  f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS review: Autofocus As we’ve come to expect from Panasonic, the 12-60mm focuses quickly, decisively, silently and accurately in almost any lighting conditions. It only slows down in very low light (think low-level artificial lighting after dark), but will still find focus so long as you point the camera towards a subject with some degree of contrast. Naturally, all Panasonic’s usual features are available – for example, the lens can silently pull focus from one subject to another during video recording. With this kind of lens it’s rare to have to call on manual focus, but if you do, it’s perfectly well behaved. Turning the focus ring will engage your preferred focusing aid on the camera – such as magnified view or peaking – and the focus-by-wire system works well enough to make it easy to bring the subject into sharp focus. Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm  f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS review: Image quality In general, the 12-60mm gives the sort of image quality we’d expect from a mid-range zoom. So it’s better than a cheap kit lens, but no match for a premium optic like Panasonic’s\
        \ 12-35mm f/2.8. Sharpness is pretty high in the centre of the image, but falls off towards the corners, with the effect being most marked at wideangle. But unless you’re examining images at the pixel level or making prints that are larger than A4, this will be of little \Lpractical consequence. Panasonic integrates some software corrections into the design, most notably of curvilinear distortion and lateral chromatic aberration, which results in clean, natural-looking images. The process is so well integrated into Micro Four Thirds that most users will never notice it’s even happening. One point to be aware of about this lens, though, is that while the extended zoom range is very useful, the slow maximum apertures mean that there’s very little scope for experimenting with shallow depth of field. Indeed, you’ll only really see anything resembling out-of-focus blur when shooting close-ups, or at the telephoto end with a distant background. This is simply the price you pay for the compact size of Micro Four Thirds. Image stabilisation is competent, without necessarily being the best I’ve ever seen. When paired with the GX8, the lens tended to deliver images at marginal shutter speeds that were acceptably sharp for most purposes, without being pixel perfect. With care, I found that I was able to get usable images using shutter speeds of 1/15sec towards the long end of the zoom, equivalent to around three stops of stabilisation. Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-60mm  f/3.5-5.6 Asph Power OIS review: Resolution, shading and curvilinear distortion Resolution Central sharpness is very good at all focal lengths, although the corners lag behind a bit, most markedly at 12mm. In general, best results are obtained around f/5.6-f/8. The lens can be stopped down to f/22, but personally I’d stop at f/11. Beyond this, diffraction blurring becomes excessive. Shading As tends to be the case on Micro Four Thirds, vignetting is practically a non-issue. It’s only worth commenting on at wideangle, and even here there’s only a relatively minor drop-off in illumination in the corners of 0.6EV at f/3.5. When you stop the lens down to f/5.6, however, this essentially disappears. Curvilinear distortion As is Panasonic’s way, distortion is corrected seamlessly in software, leaving behind very mild barrel distortion at wideangle that you’ll barely see. Go out of your way to produce uncorrected raw files and you’ll see quite considerable barrel distortion at 12mm and a little pincushion at 60mm, but this is essentially academic."

      value: There is no doubt that the OM System M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3 has potential and is decent value for money. However, there are compromises. Sharpness is acceptable but if you demand critical crispness for super-big enlargements, this lens might not be for you and going for a less ambitious zoom might suit you better.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Superzoom lenses with large zoom ratios have been popular among enthusiasts ever since they arrived on the scene. The allure of going out with the camera and just one lens for almost every photo opportunity is compelling. However, lenses that cover a very wide focal length range are less good when it comes to image quality, which is why the best performing zooms are less ambitious. The OM System M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3 has an incredible 16.6x zoom range. With the 2x crop factor of the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) format, this range is equivalent to 24-400mm in the 35mm format. For MFT cameras, there is nothing quite like this wide-ranging zoom. The next closest are the Panasonic Lumix G Vario 14-140mm f/3.5-5.6II Asph Power OIS which sells at $498/£619, the OM System 12-100mm f/4 IS PRO at $1199/£1199 and the Tamron 14-150mm f/3.5-5.8 Di III at $300 used/£494. The latter is shown as available new from some UK retailers but is no longer listed on Tamron’s website. Cramming so many focal lengths into a single lens inevitably involves compromises in optical performance. Less good sharpness, poorer rendition of fine detail and susceptibility to flare and ghosting are potential issues that can befall superzoom lenses. However, OM Systems (formerly Olympus Cameras) has an impressive track record with its lenses, so let’s see how this lens performs on the AP test bench. For more reading on MFT lenses, check out our pick of the Best Micro Four Third lenses in 2023 here . Olympus 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3: Features In order to achieve the immense zoom range, Olympus has really gone to town on the optics. The 12-200mm employs 16 elements in 11 groups, including three aspherical elements and a whole array made of special materials, including extra-low-dispersion (ED) glass, super ED glass, high refractive index (HR) glass and super HR glass, with the aim of reducing distortion and chromatic aberration. Comparing optical formulae shows a distinct resemblance to the aforementioned 12-100mm, although with slightly reduced complexity that’s presumably attributable to the absence of optical stabilisation in the 12-200mm. Focusing is internal, with a minimum distance of just 0.22m available at the wideangle end. Zoom to full telephoto and this increases to approximately 70cm, but now with a maximum magnification equivalent to 0.46x, corresponding to an image area of 7.6 x 5.7cm. This lets you capture close-ups with a decent working distance of 50cm from the subject. The lens features a dust-, splash- and freeze-proof design, including a seal around the mount to prevent water ingress. It has a non-rotating 72mm filter thread, and a petal-type hood is included in the box. As usual, I’d recommend using this as a matter of course, both to reduce flare and to protect the front element. Olympus 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3: Build and handling Appropriately for a lens that’s ideal for travel, the 12-200mm features relatively lightweight construction, with a plastic exterior instead of the metal barrel used by its Pro-line cousin. But that’s not to say it’s poorly-made, and there’s impressively little play to the barrel even when it’s fully extended to the 200mm position. Zoom creep is almost non-existent when the lens is retracted to 12mm, but the lens will extend under its own weight when pointed downwards at longer focal lengths. At approximately 10cm long and 455g in weight, this is a large lens by Micro Four Thirds standards, although it’s a fair bit smaller and lighter than the high-end 12-100mm f/4. It’s actually very similar in size and weight to 18-300mm zooms for APS-C DSLRs, but Olympus’s smaller mirrorless bodies mean that the overall package ends up being more compact. Despite its size I found it a good match to the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II that I predominantly used for testing, but I’d think twice about using it on smaller PEN bodies, particularly without a viewfinder. For the record, I found it also worked perfectly well on Panasonic Micro Four Thirds bodies. The broad zoom ring occupies most of the barrel, meaning it falls naturally to hand during shooting. It rotates through approximately 90 degrees from the wide to telephoto positions, meaning no shift in grip is required to access the full zoom range. It’s a little stiff in operation, with a noticeable increase in force required to get past the 100mm point, but this doesn’t hamper composition in practical use. The smoothly rotating manual focus ring is placed further forwards, and activates a focus-by-wire mechanism. Olympus 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3: Autofocus As we’ve come to expect from Olympus, in good light the 12-200mm provides generally fast, decisive and silent autofocus. But its relatively small maximum aperture means it struggles noticeably in lower light levels, especially at the long end of the zoom. So while it’s perfectly well behaved for daytime shooting, it’s not going to be the best choice indoors or at night. When it comes to continuous focus, chances
        are the camera body will be the limiting factor. Only Olympus’s top-of-the-range E-M1 series bodies feature phase detection for rapid C-AF, with the others falling back on the slower contrast-detection method. I found that the lens easily kept up with everything the E-M5 II’s AF system asked of it when tracking moving subjects. Switching the camera to manual focus activates the ring at the front of the lens, which drives the lens’s focus group electronically. Rotating the ring will also initialise your preferred focus aid, either magnified view or peaking, depending on how the camera is configured. Manual focusing works well, making it easy to get sharp images on the few occasions when autofocus fails. Olympus 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3: Performance The moment you start looking closely at images recorded using the 12-200mm, it becomes clear that this really isn’t a lens for pixel-peepers. Like most superzooms, it’s actually pretty good at its wider settings, especially when stopped down a touch to sharpen up the corners. However it gets less sharp as you zoom in, and is just plain soft at telephoto. So if you’re looking for crisp detail corner-to-corner when viewing your images up-close onscreen, or want to make super-sharp A3 prints, you’ll need to compromise on zoom range and save up more money for the 12-100mm F4 IS Pro or 12-40mm f/2.8 Pro. Bit if you aren’t so demanding on fine detail, then the 12-200mm actually does a pretty decent job. One noteworthy positive is the impressive close-up capability. While you’ll get the closest focus at wideangle, you’ll get the highest subject magnification at telephoto, and with a decent working distance too. This is handy if you want to avoid disturbing skittish subjects. Like all Micro Four Thirds lenses, the 12-200mm benefits from integrated software distortion compensation, with the lens passing the requisite correction parameters to the camera, which are also encoded into raw files. This means you don’t see the unpleasant bending of straight lines along the edges of the frame that’s characteristic of SLR equivalents. On older Olympus bodies such as the original OM-D E-M5 you’ll see colour fringing towards the corners due to lateral chromatic aberration, especially at full telephoto, but this is successfully suppressed on more recent models, including those from Panasonic. The lack of optical stabilisation is much less of a problem than I initially feared. It’s clear that 200mm is reaching the limits of what both Olympus and Panasonic’s in-body stabilisation systems can sensibly work with, meaning you’ll probably only get a couple of stops of shake reduction at the telephoto end. But that’s a lot better than nothing, and you’ll still get considerably greater stabilisation at wideangle. However I really wouldn’t recommend using this lens on Panasonic bodies that lack in-body stabilisation. With its long focal length, the 12-200mm can deliver some nicely blurred backgrounds, especially when shooting close-ups. In fact I was pleasantly surprised by the attractiveness of the bokeh, which is usually a weakness of superzoom lenses. Flare resistance is pretty impressive too, given the complexity of the optical design. Olympus 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3: Resolution Even a quick glance at our Image Engineering MTF tests reveals that this isn’t the sharpest optic you’ll come across. At wideangle it records very respectable central sharpness, but the corners lag behind. In the middle of the zoom range it’s not so sharp in the centre, and the corners are even softer. Zoom to full telephoto, and it’s simply not very sharp at all. For best results, select apertures around f/5.6-f/8. Olympus 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3: Shading On the whole, vignetting doesn’t present much of a problem with this lens. There’s no appreciable shading with the aperture wide open either at wideangle or in the mid-range, but some does become visible at the telephoto end. Even then, you’ll probably only discern it with evenly-toned subjects, and it’s not especially objectionable anyway. It also decreases quickly on stopping down. Olympus 12-200mm f/3.5-6.3: Curvilinear distortion The Micro Four Thirds system uses integrated software compensation to deal with curvilinear distortion, applied automatically in-camera and with correction values recorded in the raw file metadata. As a result, you simply don’t see the massive distortion that you’d expect with such a long zoom range – it’s processed away automatically to give near-perfectly straight lines.'

      value: The Samsung Galaxy S22 is now roughly half the original price. Could the Samsung Galaxy S22 be the best mid-range smartphone in 2023?
    - type: conclusion
      value: For those looking for a bargain smartphone, last years flagship smartphones are an increasingly good place to look, especially as the prices keep on dropping. Some would also argue that the latest flagship phones don’t really move the market on much, as flagship smartphones have been really good for so long.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Now that the Samsung Galaxy S22 is last years entry-level model in Samsung’s flagship S series, replaced by the S23, it’s now available for mid-range prices. Does this make it one of the best mid-range phones available ? Find out in our review by expert Joshua Waller. Key Features at a glance: Samsung Galaxy S22 Hardware, design and features Not everyone has the $1000 / £1000 needed for the flagship smartphones available, and not everyone wants to pay huge monthly fees for mobile phone contracts, so companies like Samsung and Apple offer better value smartphones, which are often smaller, but still offer high-end cameras. If you’re prepared to go for last years model, you can save even more money , and that’s where the Samsung Galaxy S22 comes in. Available for just $699 or £449 it comes in at a price that’s more similar to mid-range smartphones from Google (such as the Google Pixel 7A ) and Samsung’s own mid-range smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy A54. But importantly it comes with a triple camera system with a telephoto camera , as well as higher spec selfie camera with autofocus and 4K video recording. In terms of cameras, the S22 may not have the 108MP or 200MP main camera, and fourth 10x telephoto camera as the S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra (respectively), but with a 50MP main camera with OIS, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle, and 10MP 3x telephoto camera with OIS, it offers a great set of cameras that put it ahead of many other dual-camera mid-range smartphones. For those who want their smartphone to be smaller, there are fewer options available, with ASUS offering the Zenfone 9 and 10 , as well as Apple offering the iPhone 14. Meaning the Samsung S22 (and S23) are amongst some of the few smaller smartphones available. The phone is a stylish looking phone with shiny silver sides, and a premium feel, as you would expect from a flagship phone. The in-screen fingerprint reader works well, and with wireless charging available it features all the main luxury items you’d expect from a flagship phone. There’s an always-on AMOLED display with a fast refresh rate of 120Hz, and with an IP68 waterproof rating you can get the phone wet without having to worry too much about it dying. Samsung Galaxy S22 Performance Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S series of phones tend to give great colour, with good levels of saturation and generally consistent results between the different camera units. Dynamic range is handled well with automatic HDR (high-dynamic range) combining a number of shots for greatly enhanced dynamic range. The main 50MP wide-angle camera gives pixel-binned 12MP images, and has an f/1.8 aperture as well as optical image stabilisation (OIS). Gone are the days of Samsung offering a variable aperture lens, but this isn’t much of an issue now, as software can give a much more blurred background, when using the portrait mode. The ultra-wide-angle camera gives good results, with great colour, and good levels of detail, however some purple fringing can be seen when photographing scenes with trees, or areas of high-contrast, particularly towards the corners of the image. The 10MP telephoto camera gives a 3x view, with is a nice telephoto camera to have on a smartphone, rather than just 2x for example. The output is actually a 12MP image, which matches the other cameras nicely. Results from the telephoto camera are good, but like most other phones with a telephoto camera, once light levels drop low enough, or when shooting outside the focus range of the lens, the camera will switch to digital zoom, with lower quality results produced. Macro performance – one difference noticeable with the S22 compared to the S22 / S23 Ultra is the fixed-focus ultra-wide-angle camera , which means it doesn’t have a dedicated macro mode. However, you can use the telephoto camera to get closer to subjects, and the main camera does a good job of giving close enough focus for acceptable close-up photographs. The 10MP selfie camera comes with AF – giving much better focus than smartphones with fixed focus, meaning it doesn’t matter how close or far away you are from the lens. This also makes a big difference when using the selfie camera for video recording. The phone offers 8K video recording at 24fps, as well as 4K video from the rear camera, as well as the selfie camera. Stabilisation is good, helping keep video stable when recording without a gimbal. Value for Money If you compare the Samsung Galaxy S22 to the S23 , you’ll find there’s not a massive difference between the models, as the S23 offers an upgraded selfie camera (12MP vs 10MP on the S22), as well as a larger battery (3900mAh vs 3700mAh), but by going for the S22 you can save yourself a decent chunk of money. The S22 also offers more in terms of cameras compared to other mid-range smartphones around this price, with the Google Pixel 7A and Nothing Phone 1 offering a dual-camera system, and the Samsung Galaxy A54 offering a triple camera system, but with the 3rd camera being a
        5MP macro camera, rather than a telephoto camera. The S22 also has the nice feature of being available in a number of different colours. If you’re specifically looking for a smaller smartphone, then the Samsung Galaxy S22, Asus Zenfone 9 and Xiaomi 13 are all options worth looking at.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: There are probably two main reasons why you might opt for the S23 over the S23 Ultra. One is price, and one is size – and both are fairly big reasons.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Samsung generally announces a number of different models which all sit within its “S” line. Right now, we have the Samsung S23 Ultra – which is the flagship device and among the best smartphones for photographers – and the Samsung S23 and the S23+. The S23 and the S23+ are designed to be “mid-range” type devices, offering a number of excellent photographic specifications but at a cheaper price than the flagship. They still sit above Samsung’s wide range of budget and cheap devices, such as the Samsung A54. Samsung Galaxy S23 at a glance: Samsung Galaxy S23 features: In terms of the camera, the Samsung S23 Ultra differs in a number of ways from the S23 and the S23+, which both share the same photographic set-up, but have different screen sizes. As such, this review can also be taken in the most part to be a review of the S23+ , as we will mostly be commenting on its photographic capabilities. For the camera, we have a triple lens setup, to include a standard (wide), ultra wide and telephoto camera . The main camera has 50MP and offers a 24mm equivalent angle of view, and has an f/1.8 aperture. It is joined by a 12MP ultra wide (13mm equivalent) and a 10MP 3x telephoto lens (70mm equivalent). As it starting to become increasingly common – even in mid-range phones, 8K video is available in 30fps , with 4K (up to 60fps) and Full HD (also up to 60fps) also available and likely to be used more commonly. Other useful features of note include the 3900mAH battery , storage capacity of up to 512GB and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile processor. As is pretty common these days, a charging plug is not included in the box – just a cable. Samsung Galaxy S23 handling and design Utilising a 6.1-inch screen , the S23 is a much better bet for those who would prefer a smaller sized smartphone, especially when compared to the relative behemoth, the S23 Ultra, which measures up at 6.8-inches. If you do prefer a larger device, then the S23+ comes in at 6.6-inches, perhaps making it a good compromise between the two. Whether you have smaller hands or just prefer how much easier a smaller device slips into your pocket, having the choice between the two different sizes is welcome – it’s just a shame you don’t get the same choice when it comes to Samsung’s flagship. Personally, I feel the S23 is just the right size to use as an actual phone – typing and scrolling is a much more comfortable experience, as is shooting with the camera one handed (compared to the S23 Ultra). Otherwise, the Galaxy S23 has a fairly simple yet sleek design. It has nicely rounded off corners, while the matte rear surface doesn’t feel overly slippy. It’s probably still wise to invest in a case if you’re worried about dropping it, though being equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 should see it withstand a decent amount of wear and tear. Samsung S23 native camera app As we’ve seen on several Samsung smartphones – and Android phones in general – the S23 has a very comprehensive native camera app, offering a wealth of different options to suit several needs. By default, the launches in “Photo” mode , which seems likely to be the mode most people will use for most of their shots. Here you can quickly access the three different lenses available by tapping the on-screen icons, as well as make changes to settings such as aspect ratio and flash. Digital zooming can be accessed by pinching outwards on the screen, with up to 30x available. An automatic night mode will kick in if you are working in low-light conditions , but unlike its more expensive sibling, there is no macro mode included. To the left of Photo mode, you will find Portrait mode . With this you can create shallow depth of field effects, both with human, non-human and still-life subjects. You can choose to either shoot at 1x or 3x, depending on how much of the background context you want to show. You can experiment with different types of bokeh, and if you are photographing a portrait in low-light, Night mode will again kick in here too. Head to the video mode and you can shoot in a variety of different resolutions and frame rates, as well as do things like switch on Super Steady (image stabilisation). You can also record video directly from the Photo mode by holding down the shutter button – but you won’t get to adjust video settings first if you do that. A set of other modes are hidden under the “More” tab. This includes the Pro mode , which gives you access to a variety of shooting parameters including UISO, shutter speed and exposure compensation. You can’t shoot raw format in this mode (unlike with the S23 Ultra), so if you want to do that you’ll need to download Samsung’s ExpertRAW app. Once you’ve downloaded that app, it’ll appear on your ‘More’ screen so you can access it quickly and easily. The ExpertRAW app is also the only way to shoot at 50 megapixels, if you wish to do so, as there’s no automatic 50MP mode in the native camera app. Other available modes in the More tab include
        Panorama, Food, Pro Video, Super Slow-Mo (Video), and Portrait Video. Samsung Galaxy S23 image quality and performance The Samsung S23 is very capable of taking some great pictures, particularly when using the main sensor and shooting in good light. The main sensor from this model and its bigger, more expensive sibling the S23 Ultra put in reasonably similar performances in good light, so if you’re looking to save a bit of cash it’s a tempting proposition. On top of this, the ultra-wide angle lens works well in landscape and similar situations without creating too much distortion. The 3x lens also comes in handy when you want to get closer to the situation. For the S23 you need to use digital zoom if you want to go beyond 3x, but 10x (digital) is decent enough in good light, beyond that, images start to become blurry and unusable. On the whole, colours are nicely vibrant, and we don’t seem to see some of the over-the-top colour saturation that other phones can be guilty of. Even better news is that the colours between the three lenses seem to be fairly well matched too. Detail is nicely rendered too, with an overall good impression when viewing at normal viewing and printing sizes. In low light, although the main lens puts in a good performance, there is a noticeable drop in quality when you use either the ultra-wide lens or the telephoto lens. When it is very dark, the S23 will use the 1x lens instead of the 3x lens and digitally crop in to make better use of the higher resolution and larger sensor. Still, it’s much better if you can move physically closer to a subject rather than zoom when light is lacking. Using the digital zoom options in low light is really best avoided entirely. Portrait mode does a fairly decent job, but it can get a little confused with fine details such as flyaway hairs, so if you look closely then you might see some unnatural drop off in focus. However, if you’re looking at regular phone screen sizes it’s a good enough overall impression. It’s disappointing not to have a macro mode, but depending how bothered you are by close-ups, this may or may not be a deal breaker. To create macro-type shots, you could use the 3x lens and shoot from a short distance. Video options are fairly good considering this is Samsung’s mid-range option. 8K is probably not likely to be used by most people, but it’s there if you need it. 4K and Full HD produce good results, with the SuperSteady option coming in handy if you want to move around while recording your videos. Samsung Galaxy S23 value for money By Samsung “S series” standards, the S23 is somewhat cheap, coming in at under $900/£900 no matter which memory size you go for. Compared to the flagship S23 Ultra, this is indeed a good saving in comparison. However, it’s also true to say that other flagship models, such as the OnePlus 11 or the Google Pixel 7 Pro can be picked up for cheaper – which makes it look less good value. If you’re keen on the Samsung brand however, and don’t want to fork out such a high amount, it’s perhaps a good choice, especially if you’re happy with (or perhaps even actively seek) a smaller device.'

      value: The Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G is one of the cheapest phones with a 200MP camera, but does it deliver a well rounded camera experience? Joshua Waller finds out.
    - type: conclusion
      value: The main camera gives the best results, so ultimately, despite this camera having a triple camera setup on the rear, it’s really only one camera that you’ll actually want to use. At this price point you could be looking at a Google Pixel 7a which has a proper dual camera setup on the back with a great main camera, and a good ultra-wide, as well as a good selfie camera. The 2MP macro camera is perhaps one of the most pointless additions ever made to a smartphone. The results are terrible, and you get better results from the main camera. It’s a shame they didn’t remove the macro camera, and spend the money on a better ultra-wide-angle camera, as this gives soft images. With this smartphone the key selling feature is the 200MP camera, and it feels like the other cameras have been added as an afterthought, after spending all the money on the main camera. This gives you a smartphone that is not very well rounded in terms of the cameras on offer. However, if you want a budget smartphone with a large 120Hz screen, 120W charging, and a headphone socket, and aren’t really too concerned about the camera features, then this is a phone that could be for you. But for photographers who want more, there are better options.

      value: 'The mid-range smartphone market is jam-packed full of different models, all vying for your attention. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro + 5G , is at the top of the list for Xiaomi’s mid-range Redmi series of smartphone, and like the Xiaomi 12T Pro features a 200MP main camera. But is that enough to impress in the competitive budget phone market? Key Features at a glance: Redmi Note 12 Pro + Hardware, design and f eatures The main 200MP camera uses 16-in-1 pixel binning , giving 12.5MP images. The 200MP sensor is using a 16-in-1 Bayer sensor, and this is designed to give luminous detail at every pixel, but not colour detail for each individual pixel, so whilst this is supposed to give more detail than using a 12MP sensor, it doesn’t give more colour detail. The majority of the camera modes produce 12MP images, with only a few modes letting you select a higher resolution than 12MP. This effectively makes the 200MP sensor a marketing feature, and it takes a lot of effort to actually see the extra detail in images. For 99% of people it really isn’t going to make much difference having a 200MP camera, compared to a good 50MP, or 64MP sensor. For example, you’d think having a 200MP camera, would allow you to crop into the centre of the image at a lower resolution and get an impressive amount of zoom, but unfortunately the 16-in-1 pixel binning sensor means the detail isn’t there. (See the Nokia PureView 808 from 2012 if you want to see a good implementation of this idea, which had a 40MP sensor with a standard Bayer sensor , this let you use lossless zoom, at a reduced resolution). Some smartphones do a better job with high-resolution sensors, and we’ve seen the best results from the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra . Rather than a flagship processor, as found in the Xiaomi 12T Pro, this phone uses a MediaTek Dimensity 1080 processor. MediaTek are historically known for budget chipsets, but have been making leaps and bounds in recent years with increased performance as well as AI and photography features. For reference, the Geekbench 6 score is 963 single core and 2394 multi-core. In the camera app you’ll find a range of photo modes including Pro, Documents, Video, Photo, Portrait, Night, and in More you can find Ultra HD (this lets you shoot at 50MP or 200MP), Short video, Panorama, VLOG, slow-motion, Time-lapse, and Long-exposure. In long exposure there are a number of different modes including Moving crowd, Neon trails, Oil painting (waterfalls), Light painting, Starry sky, and Star trails. For most of these modes you can start the exposure and then end it when you’ve shot for the required time. There are a number of different filters and effects available in photo and playback modes, including 7 film effects (as seen on the Xiaomi 13 and 13 Pro ), with KC64, V-250, H-400, KP160, FC400, C-50D, KG200. We’re guessing that some of these are meant to represent Kodachrome, Velvia, Fujicolor, and Kodak Gold. In playback you’ll find the usual editing options, but you’ll also find a number of AI options including Art framing, Erase, Sky (sky replacement), Sticker, and Frame. The erase feature is like Google’s Magic Eraser, but on first try doesn’t seem as quick or refined, and when you first select one of these options, you can end up waiting 10 seconds plus whilst the phone says “Just a sec”. In long exposure there are a number of different modes including Moving crowd, Neon trails, Oil painting (waterfalls), Light painting, Starry sky, and Star trails. For most of these modes you can start the exposure and then end it when you’ve shot for the required time. There’s a side fingerprint sensor, as well as AI face unlock for security purposes. NFC is built-in, as well as stereo speakers. Increasingly rare is the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone socket. There’s a generous 5000mAh battery, with a 120W charger included in the box, meaning you can charge your phone in record time. Finally the phone offers an IP53 rating meaning there is some weatherproofing. How does the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ compare to the Redmi Note 12 Pro? The Redmi Note 12 Pro+ and 12 Pro are very similar devices, with the same screen size, same battery, and both feature stereo speakers as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack. The rear cameras differ, in that the 12 Pro+ features a 200MP f/1.7 camera, whereas the 12 Pro features a 50MP f/1.9 camera, both with optical image stabilisation (OIS). The ultra-wide, macro and selfie cameras are the same on both. The Pro+ comes with a 120W charger, whereas the Pro comes with a 67W charger. Redmi Note 12 Pro + Performance The main camera on the Redmi Note 12 Pro + gives the best results, and with optical image stabilisation (OIS) you can use it in less than ideal conditions. It gives a 24mm equivalent, meaning wide-angle shots, which is great for landscapes as well as general photography. The camera gives bright colourful photos, and detail is reasonable. Nowhere near what you’d get from a real camera with a high resolution
        sensor, but as long as you treat the camera as a 12.5MP camera, you should be pleased with the results. The bright aperture of f/1.7 is reported at f/1.6 in the EXIF data, and this is on the brighter side of things for a smartphone, meaning the ISO speed is normally kept quite low, and images show very little signs of noise. The ultra-wide-angle camera is almost capable of taking acceptable ultra-wide-angle shots, but even with an 8MP resolution you can see the poor image quality particularly towards the corners of the frame. It’s almost like a toy camera in comparison to the 200MP main camera. How can a phone be marketed as having a 200MP camera, and that being an essential and amazing feature, and then they also provide you with an 8MP camera, as though megapixels don’t matter in the slightest? Which is it, do high megapixel counts matter, or do they not? There is no telephoto camera , however, there is the option to use 2x zoom, which takes a crop of the image. With 200MP on offer, you’d think you’d get some decent results, but unfortunately the results aren’t anything special. If you pinch to zoom you can go up to 10x digital zoom, but we wouldn’t recommend using anything more than 2x zoom. The 2MP macro camera is quite frankly terrible, with a low resolution of just 2MP, and a fixed focus, you can only use it at a specific distance. This is clearly a waste of space, as you can get better close-up results from the main camera, with more natural looking results, better focus, and better background blur. It’s a shame they didn’t spend the money on a better ultra-wide-angle camera, rather than the 2MP macro camera. Even when using the main camera and 2x digital zoom, you’re still going to get better photos than using the dedicated macro camera. It really is time these 2MP macro cameras we banished from society. The portrait mode lets you adjust the “aperture” with differing levels of background blur depending on what you select. There are beauty options, as well as access to the filters. The framing stays the same as when using the normal photo modes, and it’s a shame there isn’t a slightly closer crop available. The selfie camera gives you 16MP images, however, the level of detail on offer looks like the camera is a quad-bayer setup, meaning you get roughly 4MP of detail in the images. As long as you don’t look to closely then the results are reasonable. Video recording Video options include 4K at 30p, FullHD at 30/60p, and slow-motion at 1080p, at 120fps. The selfie camera is maxed out at 1080p. Recording 4K video handheld, stabilisation performs at a reasonable level, however I’ve definitely seen better stabilisation on other smartphones. Lens flare is an issue in this video, but was generally not much of an issue in photos. Value for Money Priced at £449, this is one of the cheapest smartphones with a 200MP camera, however, we’d much prefer a better combination of two good rear cameras than one good, and two poor cameras, as is the case with the 12 Pro+. It’s a real shame, as everything else about this smartphone, as a phone, is nice. The best alternative is the Google Pixel 7a which has an excellent dual camera rear setup, clever AI photography features, and a good selfie camera with 4K video. Other alternatives to look at can be found in our guide to the best budget phones .'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Google once again proves that you don’t need to spend big money to get an excellent smartphone, and whilst it’s a shame this phone isn’t the same RRP as the Pixel 6a was, the slight increase in price seems well worth it. The Pixel 7a gives you two rear cameras that perform very well, with a main camera that gives a higher resolution final image than many other phones, a great ultra-wide-angle camera, along with a much-improved selfie camera. The fact that the selfie camera offers 4K video recording, is impressive, especially since some smartphones that cost double the price don’t. There’s even a good level of close-up performance from the phone, and even though it doesn’t offer a dedicated macro mode, we were impressed by the results it offered, as close-up photos showed plenty of detail. Whilst you don’t get a pro or expert mode, you do get a whole host of useful photography features, including motion blur (for creative waterfall shots and more), night mode, magic eraser, plus portrait modes that make you look great. Sure, the phone is missing a dedicated telephoto camera, but if you just want the occasional 2x photo, then the Pixel 7a can produce decent results. At this price point, there’s no other phone I’d recommend, and therefore the Google Pixel 7a comes highly recommended.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The latest Pixel refresh is a mid-year update to the entry-level model in the range, and this time the new Google Pixel 7a includes a number of updates that will benefit photographers , including an updated main camera, and the addition of the motion modes found on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. The Pixel 7a comes in at $499 / £449, which is a slight bump in price compared to the Pixal 6a which had an RRP of $50 / £50 less, although you’ll often find it on offer for even less than this. Does the new Pixel 7a offer enough to make it the best budget camera phone for photographers ? Find out in our review. Goodle Pixel 7a at a glance: Google Pixel 7a Hardware, design and features The design of the Google Pixel 7a should look familiar to anyone who’s seen other Pixel phones, with the now standard visor bar across the back housing the dual camera unit. The Pixel 7a steps up the quality in both styling and feel compared to the 6a. However, there have been a number of improvements made to the smartphone this time round, and whilst they may seem relatively minor, they make a noticeable difference and make this smartphone stand out more, particularly in this sub 500 price point. The rear cameras have both been updated compared to the Pixel 6a , and similarly the selfie camera has been upgraded to a 13MP camera, now with 4K video, rather than FullHD video on the 6a. The two rear cameras are now made up of a 64MP f/1.9 main camera with OIS, with a wider view at 25mm equivalent, and 16MP pixel-binned images. The ultra-wide-angle camera is a 13MP f/2.2 camera with a 14mm equivalent. Both support 4K video, with the main camera offering up to 60fps. The 64MP main camera gives 16MP pixel-binned images, giving a higher resolution than offered by the Pixel 7 Pro, although of course, there is no telephoto camera, so the Pixel 7a has to rely on digital zoom, or Super Res Zoom, like the Pixel 7. By default this gives a 2x option, but you can pinch the screen to zoom even further, up to 8x. Long exposure has been added, for the first time in the a series , as found on the 7 and 7 Pro, and this is useful for waterfalls, light trails, or crowds etc. However, unlike other smartphones, where you can hold the button for as long as you want, on the Pixel 7a (and other Pixels) the length of time is controlled entirely by the phone, so at times the exposure can be shorter than you wanted. Real Tone is included, and this is an AI system that has been trained with over 10,000 portraits of people of colour, so that the camera can give improved auto white balance, to ensure people of colour, especially those with darker skin tones, are rendered authentically. Night Sight is said to be improved, with improved low-light performance, it’s also been designed to be quicker than previously. You can adjust the length of time, if you want a longer exposure, and higher quality. Magic eraser is available, and can be found when viewing photos back in the photo gallery. You’ll need to go into the editing options to find this feature. Photo Unblur is designed to unblur any blurry photo – and works with new photos as well as any old photos in your photo library. It’s also designed to work with faces. The battery is designed to give at least 24 hours of operation, and this can be extended further with extreme battery saver. The battery is a 4385mAh unit, which is fairly generous, however the relatively slow charging at 18W is poor compared to many other smartphones. Wireless charging is supported which is nice to have. The Camera app The Pixel 7a camera app is a rather simplistic affair, with options to switch between the cameras, as well as switch to a 2x zoom mode. Like other Pixel smartphones, there is no pro or expert mode available, meaning you won’t find full manual controls on this phone. However, that’s not to say that you can’t achieve quite a few different things with the right situation. For example, in the Night Sight mode you can adjust this from 3s to 6s, and when the phone detects a stable base, it can extend this even further, with up to a 4 minute exposure possible, making it suitable for astrophotography . In terms of manual controls, the phone does let you adjust the white balance as well as the exposure, and in advanced options you can enable RAW+JPEG shooting. Beyond this you’re fairly limited. Google Pixel 7a Performance and image quality The main 64MP wide-angle camera gives impressive results – and is surprisingly capable of close-up photography, such as food photography, with little effort. Colour reproduction is very pleasing, with great results straight away. Images also appear to be consistent, from shot to shot, as well as between the different cameras on the phone. Dynamic range, and HDR is handled automatically, and the camera can cope very well with scenes with high levels of contrast. There are times when images can look very saturated, but generally they give a realistic representation of the conditions. You also get
        16MP images, thanks to the pixel-binned images from the 64MP sensor, giving it an edge, in terms of resolution over other smartphones which tend to give 12-12.5MP images. The 13MP ultra-wide-angle camera gives very good results, with relatively low levels of noise, and very good colour reproduction. Distortion is fairly well controlled, although does become apparent in some circumstances, depending on what you’re photographing. Digital zoom is available as a 2x option, using Super Resolution Zoom , and can give good results, and they look good on screen, but can be lacking in detail, especially compared to actual 2x optical zoom cameras. You can zoom further by pinching, but again, there is no real match for a telephoto camera, and if you need to go much beyond 2x zoom, then the Google Pixel 7 Pro or another smartphone is needed. Whilst the camera doesn’t specifically talk about “Macro shooting” , the close-up focus of the main camera is good enough for close-up shots of food, pets and other small objects, and if you use the 2x option, you can take frame-filling close-up photos of objects as small at Hot Wheels cars. The selfie camera is a 13MP unit, with fixed focus, and portrait mode is available. This automatically blurs the background, and does a relatively good job of cutting out the subject, without making too much mess of the hair. This performs best in good light, with lower detail shown in low-light shots. As it’s fixed focus you’ll need to make sure you’re the optimum distance from the camera for the sharpest results, too close and your face will be blurred. Video recording gives you options for 4K at 60fps from the main camera, or 4K 30fps when using the selfie camera. There are slow motion and time lapse options, as well as a range of video stabilisation options, including standard, locked, active and cinematic pan. For those interested in recording voices, there is a “Speech enhancement” option designed to improve audio when recording in busy environments. Value for Money The Google Pixel 7a is available for $499/£449, which makes it competitively priced with other sub-$500 smartphones, such as the Nothing Phone 1 (around $400), and even begins to give the Google Pixel 7 a run for it’s money, with a higher resolution main camera, and a higher resolution selfie camera. With the Google Pixel 7a offering such a competent and well-rounded camera system, it really does make you wonder if you need to spend more than $500/£450 for a smartphone. When you can get the Google Pixel 7a, and it performs this well, do you really need to spend double this price, to get a flagship camera phone ?'

      value: The Xiaomi 13 is a more affordable premium smartphone, with a triple Leica camera system, and more compact than most smartphones, but how does it perform?
    - type: conclusion
      value: The Xiaomi 13 is a nice mid-to-premium range, mid-sized smartphone, with some nice features, and a reasonably good triple camera setup, however, it’s ever so slightly let down by the selfie-camera, which lacks 4K video recording, and lacks AF. This has been available on most higher end Samsung smartphones for several years, and is also available on the significantly cheaper Samsung Galaxy S22 . At this price point, and in such a competitive market, smartphones really need to be giving users excellent cameras all-round, and in the case of the Xiaomi 13, the rear cameras are very good, but the ultra-wide-angle camera could be better (with AF), and the selfie camera could also be better. There’s also the lack of a dedicated macro mode, which means those looking for a smartphone for macro photography are better off looking elsewhere. We were also left having to second guess what the colour would look like, as the Leica Vibrant colour profile could vary wildly depending on the scene photographed. We didn’t want to use the Leica Authentic colour option as this was too muted for our tastes, either. Then in other modes these options disappear, and the AI setting can further muddy the waters and add confusion to the shooting experience. However, saying all this, you could quickly get used to the colour options if you weren’t comparing this phone to others, and it’s nice to see that the colours generally match between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto cameras, and if you’re a fan of highly saturated photos, then this might be to your liking. Unfortunately for Xiaomi, other brands like Apple, Samsung and Google, are ever so slightly more refined, and make the shooting experience just that little bit easier, and whilst this is still a very good smartphone, it doesn’t quite reach the same level of finesse as others. For just a little bit more money, you can get a smartphone with improved selfie camera, or better macro performance.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Xiaomi 13 sits near the top of the flagship range of Leica branded smartphones from Xiaomi, with the 13 Pro and Ultra above it. The top of the range Xiaomi 13 Ultra , has a 1inch sensor and variable aperture, plus an additional telephoto camera. The 13 is a mid-sized, almost compact smartphone, with a 6.36inch screen, and a more wallet friendly price of around £799. With a triple camera setup and Leica colours, is this a smartphone that delivers the goods for photographer? Joshua Waller finds out in this full review. How does the Xiaomi 13, 13 Pro, and 13 Ultra compare? As you go up the Xaiomi 13 range the camera system improves, with a triple camera setup on the 13 and 13 Pro, and then a quad camera setup on the 13 Ultra. Here are the different cameras on each in a nutshell: Read our Xiaomi 13 Pro review for full details . Key Features at a glance: Xiaomi 13 Features The Xiaomi 13 is part of Xiaomi’s partnership with Leica , and like most similarly priced Android smartphones offers a triple camera setup on the rear, as well as a punch-hole selfie camera on the front. On starting the camera app for the very first time you are prompted to choose between Leica Vibrant and Leica Authentic colour, and as you can tell from the name, Vibrant gives you more vibrant and colourful images, whilst Leica Authentic is designed to give you more natural looking images. Both are tuned to give “Leica” esque colours. More on this later in the review. The main camera features a 50MP quad-bayer sensor, which means you get 12.5MP images unless you specifically use the 50MP shooting mode. If you switch to this mode you don’t get the Leica colour options. This is joined by a 10MP f/2.0 telephoto camera, with a 75mm equivalent view, as well as a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle camera with a 15mm equivalent view. The selfie camera is a 32MP quad-bayer sensor camera, meaning you get pixel-binned 8MP images. The lens is fixed focus, meaning there is an optimal distance from the camera to the subject, and if you go outside of this you’ll end up with blurred faces. The Xiaomi 13 feels incredibly sturdy and well-made with an IP68 rating, although the back of the phone is very prone to fingerprints. This can be avoided with a case or skin. There’s also face unlock available. There are all the usual features that are now expected on this level of smartphone, including stereo speakers, USB type-C, and the latest versions of Bluetooth (5.3) and Wi-Fi (6e). There’s an under-screen fingerprint reader, a 4500mAh battery, plus NFC, as well as the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen2 processor, meaning you’ll get fast performance and a responsive experience. There’s a 67W charger included in the box, meaning rapid charging as well. The Camera App shooting experience There are a wide variety of options available, and the first time you start the photo app, you’re given the choice of Leica Vibrant or Leica Authentic colour. However, you can also select from a long list of additional colour modes, such as Leica Viv (Vivid), Nat, BW Nat, BW HC, KC64, and others. These aren’t explained, so it’s up to you to guess that KC64 is most likely meant to represent Kodachrome 64. Switch on AI and the colour reproduction will be adjusted again, depending on what the AI decides. This can make it difficult to work out what the best options are, but sticking with Leica Vibrant, and switching AI and the filters off is probably the easiest. You also don’t get much information in playback, with the details tab missing a lot of information, other than the basics, such as the EXIF data. Switch to the Pro mode and you get a variety of advanced options as well as raw shooting, plus you can adjust saturation, contrast and sharpness manually, but you still have to choose between Leica Vibrant or Leica Authentic. These differences found between the different shooting modes and cameras can make the shooting experience feel a little disjointed. There are also a range of long-exposure modes, including moving crowd, neon trails, oil painting (waterfalls), light painting, starry sky and star trails. There’s a super-moon mode for shooting photos of the moon, and this sets the camera to 5x zoom. Hopefully it isn’t using the same AI as Samsung. Xiaomi 13 Performance Colour reproduction tends to alternate between a little bit dull and cool, lacking warmth, and then going the other way and being overly saturated, particularly blues and greens. This was noticed with the camera set to Leica Vibrant. There are two options for colour – Leica Vibrant and Leica Authentic . Leica Authentic seems overly dull and lacklustre, so I opted for Leica Vibrant, and there were times when even this seemed quite dull, and times when it was too “vibrant”. Switch on AI and you’ll get even more vibrant colours. I don’t really mind too much if colours are too vibrant, but have switched off AI to try and avoid them from be excessively vibrant (saturated). However, if the colour reproduction changing wildly
        (even with AI switched off) is something that might frustrate you, then you may want to switch to the other modes, such as the 50MP mode, or the selfie camera, where the Leica colour options disappear. The f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle camera gives a 15mm equivalent, with fixed focus. There is some noise visible in images, even when shooting in bright sunny conditions, however, this is reasonably good looking, as detail remains decent and distortion is well-controlled. The lack of auto-focus means the camera can’t be used for macro photography , and low-light performance isn’t as good as the main camera. Apart from the previously mentioned colour “issues” – the main wide-angle camera performs very well, giving good results in low-light thanks to the dedicated night mode . If the camera detects low-light then the camera will automatically switch to the night mode. Focus can be a bit hit and miss, with the telephoto camera occasionally missing focus, and instead focusing on the background rather than the foreground subject, and therefore it’s best to think of the telephoto camera as most suited to distant subjects. Pincushion distortion is visible when there are straight edges in the frame, and detail did look a little soft at times. Macro performance is an area that is lacking as I tried to use the telephoto camera for close-up photography, however if lighting levels are too dark, the 3.2x option simply uses digital zoom from the main camera. Also if you’re too close to the subject, which is a lot of the time, then the phone will simply switch to digital zoom, using the main camera, and you have no way of knowing unless you check the image details in playback. In the portrait mode you can adjust the f-stop and this will alter the level of background blur, and you can apply beauty effects if you want. There’s also a set of Master lens options within the portrait mode with the choice of a 35mm (black and white, above), 50mm (swirly bokeh), 75mm (portrait), and 90mm (soft focus). Some of these are better than others, and the 90mm soft focus option is best avoided. The selfie camera gives a number of portrait options, however, one option that would be really useful to have is the ability to switch on the HDR mode when taking portraits with the selfie camera. Switch to the photo mode and you can have HDR on, but you can’t have any portrait effects. Switch to the portrait mode (with bokeh, skin smooth, beauty modes etc), and you can’t use the HDR option, resulting in portraits lacking dynamic range. The look of standard photos, and portrait photos, without the use of skin smoothing can look overly detailed, giving a harsh look to skin tones and detail. The Leica colour options disappear when using the selfie camera, and the lack of AF, will disappoint, as will the lack of 4K video, meaning that vloggers would be better off using the rear cameras. Video can be recorded in 4K resolution from all of the rear cameras. If you want to record 8K video then this can be done with the main camera only, at 24fps. Video stabilisation works relatively well, and there are different options depending on how strong you want the stabilisation to be, with the best options available with the main camera only. Switch on HDR video, and this is also only available with the main camera. Value for Money At £799 this is a good value smartphone, with a triple camera setup, however, the Samsung Galaxy S22 ($450 / £450-570, 128GB/256GB), and S23 ($750 / £799-849) are also strong contenders, as well as the Google Pixel 7 Pro ($570 / £690-849). If you’re specifically looking for a compact smartphone, then the Samsung Galaxy S22, Asus Zenfone 9 and Xiaomi 13 are all in the running. It’s also better value than the iPhone 14, which is $799 (renewed) / £849, with a dual camera setup. You’ll need the iPhone 14 Pro (from $1009 / £1099) if you want a triple camera setup from Apple. If your budget stretches further then the Xiaomi 13 Pro is the next step up, and features a similar, but improved triple camera setup, with improved macro performance amongst other things.'

      value: Amy Davies reviews the premium Xiaomi 13 Pro, with a triple 50MP camera system and Leica lenses, could this be a top contender for photographers?
    - type: conclusion
      value: There’s an awful lot to like about the Xiaomi 13 Pro if your main concern is the quality of the on-board cameras. While it doesn’t quite steal the crown from the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra , it’s an extremely capable smartphone which produces excellent results in a wide variety of different shooting scenarios. It’s packed with a good range of features, and having three 50MP sensors, including a one-inch main one, puts it ahead of most rivals – while the collaboration with Leica seems to have paid off well too. A relatively high price point for a device from a company that doesn’t have the household name status of other manufacturers like Apple and Samsung may put off some buyers, but if photographers are willing to look past that then they can pick up a very good flagship and make a saving. Let’s also not forget that you get a high-speed charger in the box, making it even more valuable. Since the 13 Pro was released, Xiaomi has also announced the Xiaomi 13 Ultra – which promises to be the ultimate smartphone for photographers , hopefully review units will be available soon and we’ll be able to find out if that’s true.

      value: 'With a one-inch sensor and lenses co-engineered with Leica – is the Xiaomi 13 Pro a contender for best smartphone for photographers ? Xiaomi 13 Pro at a glance: Hardware, design and features The smartphone market is seemingly pretty much dominated by the likes of Samsung and Apple, but there’s plenty of other manufacturers out there keen to grab your attention. One such producer is the Chinese company, Xiaomi, which you might be surprised to learn actually accounts for around 12% of global smartphone sales – it might not be so popular in the US or UK but in other markets it’s as big as those other household names. At the time of writing, it’s hard to find the Xiaomi 13 Pro on sale in the US. Xiaomi has teamed up with Leica We’ve seen a few collaborations between traditional camera makers and smartphone producers in the past few years, such as OnePlus teaming up with Hasselblad. Xiaomi has teamed up with Leica – previously known for working with Huawei – to produce the lenses for the 13 Pro (and other models), which is likely to give an attractive sheen to prospective owners particularly interested in the phone’s camera capabilities. There’s plenty of other impressive camera specs here too, with three 50 megapixel sensors , one of which being a large one-inch format – something which is still very rare to see in a smartphone. The default output of images is 12 megapixels, unless you elect to shoot in 50MP mode. The ‘telephoto’ camera boasts a 75mm equivalent focal length and is described as ‘floating’. Apparently inspired by the Leica Noctilux-M 75 f/1.25 ASPH lens, the lens module moves backwards for close-up shots, and forwards when required for portrait work. With this lens you can shoot as close as 10cm away from the subject. Meanwhile, the ultra wide lens is also equipped with macro capabilities , this time allowing you to get as close as 5cm to the subject – but with a completely different angle of view. These two functions together make the 13 Pro one of the best smartphones for macro currently on the market. At 6.73-inches, the Xiaomi 13 Pro’s screen is on the large side of the market, being comparable to models such as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra (6.8-inches) and the iPhone 14 Pro Max (6.7-inches). Some may find these larger sizes a little overwhelming for their hands, but it seems to be a very popular trend at the moment – and it’s hard to deny how good your photos and videos look good on a bigger screen. Rounded edges and a very shiny exterior give the Xiaomi 13 Pro a very polished look – it’s wise to invest in a case to stop it from slipping off smooth surfaces. The screen makes use of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus so it should withstand knocks and scrapes fairly well, while the phone is 1P68 water and dust resistant (it’s been tested to survive depths of 1.5m for up to 30 minutes). As with many modern smartphones, the Xiaomi 13 Pro is capable of recording video at up to 8K , with 24fps available at that resolution. The average user is far more likely to use 4K (up to 60fps) or Full HD (also up to 60fps). A slew of other video options including slow motion (up to 1920fps), night video, video pro mode and a tracking mode are also available. A 4820mAh battery is included, which has fast-charging capability – indeed a charger is even included in the box, a relatively rarity these days. With this 120W charger , you can fully charge the phone in under 25 minutes. Wireless charging is also available. In our tests, we found that the phone generally lasted a full day with reasonably modest usage, including several photo and video sessions. 12GB of RAM is included, while a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform makes the smartphone pretty swift in operation – at least for our purposes (photography mainly). In theory there’s both 256GB and 512GB storage options available, but at the time of writing, it was hard to find any 512GB options actually on sale. Xiaomi 13 Pro camera app The Xiaomi 13 Pro uses quite a comprehensive native camera app, with several different shooting modes available to choose from. By default, the shooting mode is “Photo”, which is what most people are likely to use as their go-to shooting mode. Here you can access the three different lenses (marked 1x, 0.6x, 3.2x, as well as fourth 2x option, which is a digital zoom using the 1x lens. Further digital zooming up to 70x is also available by pinching on the screen. In this mode, you can opt to switch on HDR shooting, a flash and “AI” modes – the latter of which adjusts settings based on what the camera thinks it’s looking at. There’s an interesting option to switch between “Leica Vibrant” and “Leica Authentic” colours too – the former is the default option and gives image colours a slight boost in saturation and contrast. You can also change options such as timer, aspect ratio and switching on Gridlines for composition. Other settings are automatic – such as if you move close to a subject, the wide-angle 5cm close-focusing will
        kick in, and if there’s not much light, the automatic Night mode will activate. To the left of photo mode is Video, where you can again access all of the lenses and digital zooming options. You can switch on HDR video recording or activate stabilisation options (Steady video or Steady video pro). You can choose resolution and frame rate options, noting that some options won’t be available depending on the combination of settings you might try to choose – for example you can’t shoot 8K and HDR at the time. If you head to the “ Pro ” mode you’ll be able to select a number of different shooting parameters, including white balance, focus, shutter speed, ISO, and exposure compensation. You can also shoot with any of the three lenses, and you can also shoot in raw (DNG) format. Here you can activate 50MP shooting (but not if you want to shoot in raw format), too, as well as change aspect ratio or switch on a timer. The same Leica Authentic / Leica Vibrant options are also available here too. The Portrait mode is somewhat unusual compared to most other smartphones. You can use it in “standard” mode, where you’ll be zoomed quite far in on the person (or other subject – such as still life), using the 3.2x telephoto camera. If you want to include more of the subject’s context, you’ll need to tap an icon of a body to zoom out. As well as this, you can also choose to shoot with the Leica “master-lens” system. If you tap a lens icon, you can choose between Black and White 35mm, Swirly Bokeh 50mm, Portrait 75mm and Soft Focus 90mm. All are worth experimenting with, but the Black and White and Portrait options give the best results. Other modes which can be used include a selectable Night mode, Panorama, Long exposure, Time-lapse and 50MP. Performance – image quality The Xiaomi 13 Pro delivers fantastic image quality in a wide range of shooting situations, making it a good competitor to some of the other best smartphones for photography, such as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and the iPhone 14 Pro. As we’d expect, the main sensor performs the best , producing images which are nicely detailed and have a good level of punchy colour – particularly if you shoot with the Leica “Vibrant” setting. Sometimes the “Authentic” setting can err a little on the dull side, although it’s fair to say that the Vibrant setting is perhaps a bit much for bright blue skies on occasion. The AI setting for blue skies goes even wilder, so we’d advise using that with caution. Better news is that colours seem to be well-matched between the three different lenses, so if you shoot the same scene from a variety of vantage points you should find that the results are fairly uniform. It’s reasonably rare to have very high-resolution sensors for anything other than the main sensor, and even more rare to have 50 megapixels for a telephoto lens. Both the additional lenses put in a great performance, although unsurprisingly in lower light conditions, they’re not quite as good as the one-inch main sensor. As we often tend to find, shooting in ultra high resolution modes is generally a fairly pointless exercise – unless you have a specific desire to print smartphone images at massive sizes. However, it’s interesting that unlike with most smartphones, you can shoot using all three lenses in 50MP mode , so subjects such as macro – using the telephoto optic – do indeed present more detail if you’re photographing something with lots of fine elements. However, it’s also true, that the additional detail is only really revealed if you scrutinise images closely. Digital zoom is helpful up unto a point. If you stick with 10x, the results aren’t too bad – especially if you don’t scrutinise them too closely – but if you start moving into 30, 40 or even 70x, you’ll be left with blurry and unusable images, so it’s best to avoid. Portrait mode does a good job, particularly when the subject has a fairly simple outline. There’s a reasonably natural drop-off in focus from the main subject, especially if you’re only looking at it at the small size of the phone screen itself – rather than large on a computer screen. Night mode delivers the best results with the main lens – as expected, but both the ultra wide and the telephoto also do a pretty good job, producing fairly impressive results which again compete with other similar flagship models. Video performs pretty well – most users probably don’t have need for 8K video, but the 4K and Full HD options produce good results. Switching on stabilisation comes in handy if you like to move while recording, but otherwise, the standard settings are pretty good. Value for money At first glance, with an asking price of over £1000, the Xiaomi 13 Pro seems like a fairly expensive proposition. However, when you compare it to other competing flagships, it starts to look a little more reasonable. For example, the iPhone 14 Pro’s cheapest price is the same at £1,099, but you get a much smaller screen. The iPhone 14 Pro Max starts at £1,199.
        The difference is even more stark when looking at the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which starts at £1,249. So, while the Xiaomi 13 Pro might not be exactly cheap, it fares well when compared to other models that perform in pretty similar ways. The 13 Pro is probably also likely to drop in price more quickly, and on the second-hand market, compared with the likes of the bigger name (at least in certain markets) Samsung and Apple phones, so the gap between prices is likely to become even wider. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your smartphone to a latest flagship and aren’t too bothered about going for one of the big names, it’s certainly worth considering saving yourself some money and going for the Xiaomi, and for those on a tighter budget, have a look at the Xiaomi 13, or the Google Pixel 7 Pro .'

    - type: conclusion
      value: For those that want a compact smartphone, but don’t want to compromise on performance, the ASUS Zenfone 9 is a good option, and on paper it offers a great combination of three cameras, all with auto-focus. However, around this price point, you don’t need to spend much more money to find a smartphone with a triple camera setup on the back, giving additional telephoto options, such as the Samsung Galaxy S22 or S23. In terms of image quality, the Zenfone 9 offers some mixed results, not as good as the results you’ll get from Samsung, Google, and Apple. The main camera gives images that just didn’t quite hit the mark, and the camera seemed very prone to lens flare when the sun was in the frame, or even outside the frame. This is a real shame, as the Pixel 7 and Galaxy S22 are both available for less than the Zenfone 9. The ultra-wide angle camera performed well, and for those that want a selfie camera with auto-focus, this could be a good option. Especially if you need a smartphone to have a headphone socket. But for the photographers out there, it’s likely you’ll be happier with a different phone. Video stabilisation is impressive, and this could be another aspect of this smartphone that would make it a strong contender. If the price drops further over time, this could be considered a bit of a bargain, especially for those looking for a compact phone.
    - type: excerpt
      value: The ASUS Zenfone 9 is a compact smartphone with premium features, with a dual-camera setup, and flagship processor. If you’re in the market for a compact smartphone, still want a headphone socket, and don’t want to pay flagship prices, then the Zenfone 9 could be for you. The price is roughly $699 / £649 (or less if you shop around), nearly half the price of most flagship phones, but is it a good buy, particularly if you’re interested in photography? Asus Zenfone 9 Key Features Asus Zenfone 9 Features The ultra-wide camera offers a 14.4mm equivalent (in 35mm equivalent terms), with an f/2.2 aperture, PDAF (Phase-detection auto-focus), a 12MP sensor, and 4cm macro focus. The main camera gives a 23.8mm equivalent (near enough 24mm in 35mm terms), and the main sensor is a 50MP Sony IMX766 1/1.56inch sensor, which uses a Quad Bayer colour filter, which gives 12.5MP images. This camera benefits from a “6-axis Hybrid Gimbal Stabilizer” which moves the lens and sensor in combination to give up to 3(degrees) of movement. In terms of video recording , the main camera offers the most impressive video recording at resolutions up to 8K (at 24fps with OIS + EIS). 4K video can be recorded at 60/30fps, again with OIS + EIS. When recording at a FullHD resolution, “HyperSteady” stabilisation becomes available, at 60/30fps. Slow motion video can be recorded at 120fps (4K), 240fps (FullHD), and 480fps (720p). The selfie camera gives a wide-angle view equivalent to 27.5mm (in 35mm terms), and also features Dual PDAF, meaning your self-portraits should be perfectly focused. This makes a refreshing change to all the selfie cameras that have fixed focus, and will also give benefits when using the selfie camera for video recording and vlogging. The selfie camera can record 4K video at 30fps. Photo features include a “Light Trail” mode, Night mode, Pro mode, Panorama, Slow-motion and timelapse modes. Light trail includes options for traffic trails (lights), light graffiti, waterfalls, flow of people, and star trails. Star trails can be set to a duration of 4.5hours! Long exposure photography is possible, with the camera allowing exposures up to 32 seconds. The 5.9inch screen is an AMOLED unit with upto 120Hz refresh rate, 112% DCI-P3 (giving a wide colour gamut), HDR 10+, and a colour accuracy of Delta-E <1 (according to ASUS). The screen offers an always-on display as well as Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. Despite the small size, there’s dual stereo speakers, as well as a headphone socket – a increasingly rare feature on modern smartphones. Other features that belong on flagship smartphones, include Wi-Fi 6/6E, 5G, NFC, and Bluetooth 5.2. There’s a single LED flash, which can be used when needed to add extra light to the scene. The Asus Zenfone 9 comes with a 30W charger in the box, as well as a protective plastic case. This is a nice addition to find in the box, however, the case very quickly scratches, so it’s likely you’ll want to find a replacement pretty sharpish. There’s a fingerprint sensor built-in to the power/unlock button, on the side of the phone, and in addition, the phone supports face recognition unlock. It’s nice to see this available, as some phones don’t offer both. The Zenfone 9 has decent battery life for a compact phone. In fact, it’s got the almost the same battery power, at 4300mAh as the significantly larger Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra – only beaten by 200mAh. This is more than the Samsung Galaxy S22 for example. However one thing missing, from the Asus Zenfone 9, is wireless charging, which is something you’ll find on most premium smartphones. Asus Zenfone 9 Performance When using the ASUS Zenfone 9, the images produced are generally good, when viewing them on their own, on-screen, however, when compared to other smartphones, the overall tone can seem a little cool, and this is particularly noticeable if you’re trying to capture warm sunsets (and other scenes that would benefit from warmer tones). The ultra-wide angle camera gives good results, with relatively little distortion. Colour is also reasonable, however noise can be an issue, and the low-light performance of the ultra-wide camera is noticeably worse than that of the main camera. The main camera can give mixed results, with images looking both overly processed, as well as soft in parts, when viewing at 100%. Images often looked a little bit disappointing, when look at the images produced by the main camera, with the colour being slightly off, or the image looked overly processed, or overly HDR (as can be seen in the image below), or a combination of all of these issues. Whilst there is no dedicated telephoto camera, the camera offers a 2x digital zoom, and like other smartphones combines multiple shots which is supposed to offer improved detail. The telephoto images produced by the Zenfone 9 are not particularly good with obvious issues visible such as over-sharpening. Macro photography can be a bit difficult with this phone, as there seems
        to be no guidance or auto-macro built-in, but if you switch to the ultra-wide-angle camera you can focus on subjects that are just 4cm from the camera – this is impressively close, however, it’s not the easiest to manage as the on-screen prompts are simply “move further away”. It would be nice if there was a dedicated macro mode available, as well as better on-screen guidance. The night mode kicks in automatically when the scene is dark enough, but not every time. A dedicated night mode can be found in the “MORE” section of the camera app, however, it’s a shame that the auto night mode doesn’t activate more readily. Using the “ Light Trails ” mode, you can select from a number of different long-exposure modes. One of these is called “Waterfalls” and is designed to let you take photos of moving water. This photo, above, was taken in bright conditions, handheld, and has given nice results. However, if you look too closely, you can see where movement has caused parts of the images to blur, particularly in plants. The selfie camera gives good results, with plenty of detail (none of this Quad Bayer nonsense here, thank you very much), and with auto-focus you can ensure your face is in focus no matter what distance you are from the phone. In addition there are bokeh (background blur) options available. Video performance Video stabilisation does a good job on standard settings, however, switch to HyperSteady, which is available at 1080P resolutions or lower, and the stabilisation levels kicks it up a notch to give incredibly stable video footage. There’s also a Pro video mode that gives additional control over video, should this be of interest. You can watch additional video samples on our YouTube channel . Value for Money The Asus Zenfone 9 is available for around $699 / £649, or less if you shop around, which makes it a good price, considering what’s on offer. However, there are other smartphones available that are on the smaller side of things including the Samsung Galaxy S22 (with a triple camera setup, available for a similar price, or less) and Galaxy S23, as well as the Xiaomi 13. There’s also the Google Pixel 7 , available for less money, and for iPhone fans, the iPhone 13 Mini is also a compact smartphone.

      value: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Review - does the best smartphone for photographers need 200MP?
    - type: conclusion
      value: 'Samsung retains the crown of “ best smartphone for photographers ” with the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, providing a fantastic all-rounder which copes well in a variety of different situations and comes with a well-featured native camera app. Speaking of marketing gimmicks, a 200MP sensor and a 100x space zoom. These are bold claims to put on a spec sheet (and corresponding advertising campaign) which in real life are generally wholly unnecessary. Yes, you can get lots of excellent detail out of the phone, but who is actually examining their smartphone pictures at that level of scrutiny. They look great on your phone screen and that’s the most important thing. Of course, all of that comes at a price – and it’s a high one. If you want the best of the best and you’ve got the cash to spend on it, then you won’t be disappointed. If you’ve already got an Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra , don’t expect to be blown away by the difference, but if you’ve got an older phone or something else entirely, then you might also consider it worth the investment. If you’re not keen to spend such a huge amount on a smartphone, there’s plenty of other excellent options out there – for example the Google Pixel 7 Pro , OnePlus 11 and, of course for those who prefer iOS, there’s also the iPhone 14 Pro . iPhone 14 Pro vs Samsung S23 Ultra: which smartphone is best for photographers? iPhone vs Android: Which is better for photography?

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra flagship has been the camera phone to beat for quite a while, but with the devices getting better and better with every iteration, it’s perhaps fair to say that each new version is only a slight improvement on the last. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra at a glance: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Hardware, Design and Features The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which follows on from last year’s S22 Ultra doesn’t evolve the device too much, though once again it contains an array of excellent features which should be very appealing to the enthusiast photographer. The big news is the jump in resolution count for the main camera, with the S23 Ultra being the first Samsung to boast a 200 megapixel sensor. We have seen smartphones with this size of sensor before, indeed, Samsung has made sensors for other manufacturers of this resolution before, but this is the first time the company has put one in its own branded phones. That means you get a boost from last year’s 108 megapixel device. As we’d expect, images are not output at 200MP by default, although you can shoot in super high resolution mode if you really want to. Thanks to pixel binning, the standard 12 MP resolution is what you’ll see and expect for almost all of your shots. In front of the 200MP sensor is an f/1.7 stabilised lens, while there are three more cameras also available to choose from. There’s a 12MP ultra wide f/2.2 combination, and two telephoto lenses, both with 10 megapixel sensors behind them. One offers 3x zoom and an f/2.4 lens, while the other is a 10x zoom with an f/4.9 aperture. There’s also ‘space zoom’ – a form of digital zoom which means you can reach 30x or 100x if you need it. With four lenses available, this puts the S23 Ultra ahead of most other flagship smartphones, with devices such as the iPhone 14 Pro and the Google Pixel 7 Pro only boasting 3 options. As usual, a range of storage options are available to choose from, starting at 256GB and rising up to 1TB, with an appropriate bump in price each time. There’s two RAM options, with a cheaper 8GB version available to go with the 256GB storage capacity, or you can plump for 12GB with any storage option. It’s generally worth spending more if you think you’ll need the extra storage, particularly as memory with this phone cannot be expanded. It’s worth opting for the larger RAM if you can too, particularly if you intend to do things like shoot 8K or 4K video, or use it for other non-photographic purposes, such as gaming. Design wise , the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is very similar to its predecessor. The screen has the same specifications, coming in at 6.8” and boasting Quad HD+ resolution. This makes the phone very large and therefore very difficult to use one handed for most people. On the plus side it means your photos and videos really pop and look vibrant. Whether you like a very large smartphone is a matter of personal preference, but it’s perhaps a shame not to see a smaller screen device – with the same camera setup – available for those who might prefer it. The edges of the S23 Ultra have been squared off just a touch compared to its predecessor to give just a hint of a larger screen when looking at it. It’s not something that’s immediately obvious, even when looking at the two phones side by side. Either way, it’s a nicely sleek and stylish approach to design, albeit a little on the slippy side – a case is pretty much a must. That said, if you do have a propensity for clumsiness, the good news is that not only is the S23 Ultra IP68 rated for waterproofing and dustproofing, it also features a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 screen which should seen it easily able to withstand scratches and dents. Video recording is available at up to 8K resolution, with an improved 30fps frame rate (24fps was available for the S22 Ultra). 8K puts it ahead of most other models on the market, though it is something we’re starting to see on more recent smartphones, even including cheaper options such as the OnePlus 11. 4K and Full HD video recording – is of course also available. “Super Steady” video stabilisation is only available in QHD (2560 x 1440) and Full HD, with a crop applied to video recording when Super Steady is enabled. Just like the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, the S23 Ultra is fitted with a 5000mAh battery , with that ultra large body being another benefit for long-lasting battery. We found during our tests that phone easily lasted a full day, even when using it frequently for photos and videos. Most of the time it lasts for more like two or even possibly into a third day if you’re a relatively light user. Fast charging is supported, as is wireless charging, but, as is pretty common these days, there’s no charger provided in the box – only a cable – so you will need to invest in these separately if you don’t already have a fast-charging plus and/or a wireless charging device. An “S Pen” stylus was included for the first time in the Ultra range with the S22 Ultra,
        so it’s no surprise to see it also sticking around here. The “Note” range of smartphones is now discontinued, so again it makes perfect sense that this is where you’ll find the stylus. Primarily this is positioned as being useful for making handwritten notes and doodles, but from a photography perspective you can also use it as a remote trigger. This comes in useful if you want to shoot selfies or group shots from a distance. Potentially you might also use it for other scenarios, such as low light or close-up shooting from a tripod, too. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Camera App Samsung smartphones have, for a long time, had a well-featured and expansive native camera app which gives you lots of choice depending on the way you might like to shoot. By default, the Photo mode is what launches, and it’s likely to be the mode that most people use most of the time. From this mode you can access all of the different lenses, as well as activate digital zooming up to 100x (called Space Zoom). In this mode, your photos will be output as standard at 12MP. But if you tap an icon at the top of the screen, you can also switch to recording in 50MP or even 200MP. Note that if you select either of these resolutions then you can only use the 1x lens (since only the sensor behind this lens has a high enough resolution sensor to facilitate this). You can also swipe to the left to select a Portrait mode, which allows shallow depth of field effects to be created (for both human and non-human subjects), while swiping to the right starts up the Video mode. If you tap on “More” you’ll see a host of other modes which you can select, including Panorama, Food, Night and so on. There’s also a Pro mode which gives you control over a number of different shooting parameters, including shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation, and white balance. You can use all four of the lenses in Pro mode, and it’s here that you’ll find the ability to record in raw format. You can shoot in the standard 12MP output, or you can switch to 50MP if you’d prefer. An “ Expert RAW ” app can be accessed via the “More” tab, but it is a separate app which needs to be downloaded. Tapping on it will take you to the separate app, but if the phone is locked then you’ll need to unlock it first. With this app, the parameters are pretty much the same as in the “Pro” mode, meaning you can change a variety of settings and shoot in raw format. The difference is, according to Samsung, that the ExpertRAW app provides a wider dynamic range when compared to using the standard app, even in Pro mode. It also includes other options, such as multiple exposures, and there’s handy settings such as a digital level to help keep your shots straight. You can edit your shots in this app using Adobe Lightroom, if you have a Creative Cloud subscription. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Performance – Image Quality Last year’s Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra was so good, that we knew that the company would have to go some way to topping it. The good news is that it has done it – but the not so good news is that you have to really examine the pictures to see the difference. If therefore, you’re thinking an upgrade will be a huge boost to your photography, you might be left a little disappointed. Images directly from the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra’s main (200MP) sensor show more detail than last year’s S22 Ultra main (108MP) sensor. But, that’s really only obvious if you’re comparing like-for-like images shot at the same time and you zoom in closely. Most people simply won’t do that. There’s also a very slight improvement in colours from the S23 Ultra, but again, it’s not enough to be hugely noticeable in isolation. Overall, images display an excellent impression of detail at the standard 12MP output, with them standing up relatively well to close-scrutiny. Colours are rendered nicely, albeit perhaps a bit oversaturated in some circumstances for some tastes. The two telephoto lenses are reasonably useful, with the 3x option providing the best results. The 10x is nice to have, but it is a lot more smudgy than the others. The Space Zoom is essentially a marketing gimmick, which, unless you are absolutely desperate to get that close to a subject and can live with the blurry results, is probably not really worth engaging with too often. If you shoot in the “Pro” or “ExpertRAW” app, then you’ll notice that colours are a little more muted. Colours between the different lenses are reasonably well matched, so if you are shooting from the same vantage point you should find that all of your images look similar. The phone also copes well with artificial light to produce well-balanced colours using its automatic white balance setting in the general Photo mode. Shooting at 200MP is a reasonably pointless exercise in most scenarios. While in some areas of a shot it does render a little more detail, it also introduces more smudging and blur in other areas of the shot. It will also leave you with huge file sizes (over 30MB,
        compared to around 3-5MB for most ordinary shots). Unless perhaps you want to print your images to the size of a billboard, it’s not a mode we’d recommend engaging all that frequently. It’s also worth noting that you can’t activate macro focusing (since it relies on the ultra wide lens) if you shoot with 200MP, so it’s not suitable for close-ups. As we’d expect, it’s from the standard lens that we see the best results, but the others also put in a good performance. The ultra-wide is the best performer of the three additional ones, being a useful width for things such as landscapes and architecture, as well as macro shots. Low light images are taken care of by the phone’s “Night” mode, which is both selectable and automatically activates when low light levels are detected. Here we see the best results from the standard lens, which produces very good images. The ultra-wide also does reasonably well here, as does the 3x, while the 10x is probably best left alone in very dark scenarios. The Portrait mode also does a good job of blurring backgrounds to leave a natural effect. Night and Portrait can be used together for low-light people shots, but the 3x option here is nowhere near as good as the 1x option. There’s less of a disparity in quality when shooting in daylight / good light. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Value for Money The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is a flagship smartphone with a flagship price point to match . It’s one of the most expensive smartphones you can currently buy, with its cheapest price of £1,249 arguably putting it out of reach of many. However, when you consider how good it is – you could argue, if you felt so inclined, that it could still be considered good value for money. It’s fair to say that you do get an awful lot for your cash . You get four lenses, a fantastic screen, 8K video recording. However, what you don’t get is a massive upgrade from the S22 Ultra – so if you’ve already got one of those, it’s probably not worth forking out here. Additionally, if you want to save a bit of cash, opting for the older model would be a smart move at this point. If you’re coming from an older or completely different model of phone, it might make sense to go for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and consider it an investment. A smartphone as good as this is perhaps less likely to date as quickly as mid-range / lesser able phones, meaning you’ll keep it for longer before swapping or upgrading.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: There’s an awful lot to like about the OnePlus 11. It comes in at a great price and really highlights just how expensive other flagship models have become in recent years. For those who don’t want to spend an outrageous amount of money on the latest tech, it’s a fantastic option. At under £800 for even the best model, you’re getting a (relative) bargain – and if you’re happy to wait until prices drop a little, then even more so. The overall impression of image quality is very good if you’re only ever examining your shots on your phone screen – and let’s face it, for a lot of people, that’s exactly what they’ll do. They’re less impressive when you examine them on a larger screen – particularly for things like Portrait mode where edges don’t always translate well, but that’s arguably a minor concern for most. Using the OnePlus 11’s native camera app is pretty good, with lots of useful features and a straightforward standard mode that works well for most of your shots. The Pro mode gives you lots of scope to take control, as well as shoot in raw format if that’s your cup of tea. However, it’s disappointing that, for all the talk about Hasselblad fine-tuning the colours, the cameras can’t agree with each other what the correct colour should be. But, on the whole, there’s a lot to recommend about the OnePlus 11 and for the price it’s impressive. If you’re keen for a good camera without the expense of some of the other best smartphones for photography , it’s recommended.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'For some time, OnePlus was the go-to name for mid-range excellence, producing phones that took on the might of Samsung and Apple, but at a price a good deal lower. Amy Davies reviews the latest model, the OnePlus 11. Following on from last year’s OnePlus 10 Pro , the newest flagship release is the OnePlus 11 – there’s no “Pro” version this year, with the company saying that the standard model fulfils all the “pro” specifications without the need for the moniker. OnePlus 11 at a glance: OnePlus 11 Features: A couple of generations ago, OnePlus brought Hasselblad on board to help create the camera, and this partnership has continued for the OnePlus 11. As a result, we get an impressive-on-paper triple-lens setup which comprises of a 50 megapixel “main” camera, with a large 1/1.56” sensor and f/1.8 aperture. It is joined by two other camera modules – a 48MP ultra-wide angle, and a 32MP short telephoto. The latter lens “only” offers a 2x zoom at 48mm equivalent, which is shorter than the 10 Pro’s, but has been done deliberately with the theory that people generally tend to take pictures of people more than they want to reach distant subjects. The usual hyperbole about the smartphone being capable of producing “DSLR-type” (when will PR departments move on to mirrorless ?) images is included in the marketing jargon, facilitated by a specific “Hasselblad Portrait Mode”. According to OnePlus, this mode has been benchmarked against actual Hasselblad XCD 30mm and 65mm optics to achieve similar results. Big words. Another promised benefit of the Hasselblad collaboration is “natural colours”, with the 11 having “improved Natural Color Calibration”, which produces 10-bit imagery with reduced banding for apparent richer colours. There’s also been the introduction of a “13-channel multi-spectral sensor” in hardware, which is said to work by identifying and removing colour bias from surrounding light conditions. It’s also supposed to help with automatic adjustments to white balance and so on. Other interesting features – from a photography perspective – include the ability to record video at up to 8K resolution, a manual mode, the option to record in raw format, and slow-motion options. Other specs include a 5,000 mAh battery with super-fast charging. A charging plug is included in the box – a relative rarity for modern smartphones. OnePlus 11 handling and design: With its 6.7-inch screen, the OnePlus 11 is rather on the large side as smartphones go. That will be appealing to some, but less so to others – that’s ultimately down to personal preference. It also has a QHD+ resolution at 525ppi – whether or not you like the big screen, it does a fantastic job of showing off your videos and images in the best way possible. The design itself is very sleek, with nicely rounded edges. It’s available in two colours – Titan Black and Eternal Green. The black version is matte, while the green version is glossy – it’s very very shiny. The only potential downside to this is that it is quite slippy when it’s without a case and can easily slide off soft furnishings. It’s recommended that you invest in a case to go with it for that reason. That said, if you do drop it, the phone is equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass for the screen, so there’s every likelihood it would withstand a good amount of damage (not something we’ve found out for definite for ourselves, though). Flipping to the back of the phone and the three camera modules, plus the additional sensor, is housed in a round profusion. It’s a fairly attractive design and doesn’t add too much bulk to the back of the camera. If you angle the phone right in bright light, you’ll see an iridescent shimmer in the housing, which is quite a nice touch. This design is different from the OnePlus 10 Pro – with the 11 being more aesthetically pleasing (again though, this might be down to personal preference). The native camera app: The native camera app can be launched directly from the home screen, or you can double tap a physical button on the side of the phone to get to it quickly – the latter method is useful if you see something unfolding in front of you that you want to capture quickly. “Photo” is the default shooting mode, which you’ll probably use for most of your photography. With this you can shoot with all three of the lenses – indicated by tapping on “0.6”, “1” or “2”. You can also pinch to zoom to activate the digital zoom, which goes up to 20x. In this basic mode, you can tap “AI” to switch on automatic scene enhancement. If you have it switched on, you’ll sometimes see words pop up which indicates a specific subject has been identified – such as “food” or “macro”. Other options available in Photo mode include being able to change the aspect ratio, switch on or off the Auto HDR function, on or off the auto Macro function and the ability to shoot in the “high res” (50MP) mode. Only the ultra-wide and standard lens can be accessed if you switch to “high res”. Further settings
        changes can also be made via a more extensive menu, giving you options such as switching a level on, switching to high-efficiency image formats and so on. Moving out of the straightforward mode, you’ve got Portrait mode . This is the mode that is supposed to create the DSLR-like quality portraits, and gives you the option to choose between the 1x or the 2x lens – the former being good for including more of the background or environment in the shot. You can also adjust the simulated aperture, from f/1.4 down to f/16. A range of filters can be added either in Photo or Portrait mode, which includes special Hasselblad options, too. Other selectable options include “ Night ” and “ Video ”, while yet more modes, such as Pano, Long Exposure and Tilt Shift are hidden away under the “More” tab, but you can add any that you use often to the main screen if you prefer. You might want to do this with the “Pro” mode for example, which is where you’ll be able to control parameters such as ISO, shutter speed, exposure compensation, white balance and so on. It’s here you’re also able to shoot in raw format if you wish – it would be nice if you could shoot in the standard Photo mode as well, but that’s perhaps a relatively small criticism. Overall, it’s a well-featured native camera app, especially when compared to the more simple offerings of some other smartphones, such as the iPhone 14 Pro , or the Google Pixel 7 Pro , which lack a dedicated pro mode. OnePlus 11 image quality and performance: The OnePlus cameras have always been competent performers, working pretty well in a good variety of situations. On occasion, they might not be quite as polished as something from Samsung or Apple, but considering the price, it’s always very satisfactory. There’s lots of good things to like about the latest iteration. Images appear to have an overall impression of good quality and lots of detail, especially when looking at them on the phone screen or via apps such as Instagram. The best performer – as we’d tend to expect – is the main camera lens , which produces good images in most scenarios that you use it in, giving you a 12.5MP image thanks to pixel-binning . The ultra-wide angle lens produces some good 12MP images though it’s generally softer than its main counterpart. The phone does well to correct most distortion in-camera, with images looking reasonably natural. The longer telephoto lens also works pretty well and despite it being shorter than some might like, with a 48mm equivalent and 12.5MP images, we’d generally agree that having a better quality but shorter lens is better than a lower quality longer one. This seems like a good decision and results in better images compared with the last OnePlus’ third lens. One small complaint however is that colours between the lenses don’t always match . This is particularly noticeable when shooting indoors or where artificial light is present. You can stand in the same spot and shoot the same scene with the three different lenses and be left with three different colours. This is disappointing considering how much emphasis has been placed on the Hasselblad collaboration. It’s generally less obvious when shooting outside, but you may see blue skies being noticeably different between shots on occasion. Overall though, colours are pretty good. Again, much has been made of the quality of the automatic white balance thanks to the Hasselblad collaboration. While it doesn’t do a terrible job, indoor photographs under artificial light tend to take on a yellower tinge than we’d like for the promises made. Night mode is a useful way of shooting in low light, and again it does a pretty good job overall (especially if looking at your images at a small size) – but it should be noted that if there are any light sources in the scene – such as street lamps, you’ll often see some distracting lens flare. Macro focusing is automatically activated when the camera detects you have gotten close to a subject. It switches to the ultra wide angle lens. While the results are again impressive when looking at them on the screen of the phone, if you look at them on a larger device – such as a computer – you can see some softness. Still, it’s a nice option to have and for most users it will do the job just fine. Portrait mode – again another aspect of the phone which has been enhanced thanks to Hasselblad’s input – produces decent blurred background images, which, as usual look pretty good when you look at them on a phone screen. If you examine them outside of that you’ll notice that it doesn’t always cope well with fussy outlines – such as hair. It’s also not as good at photographing non-human subjects – such as animals or still life subjects – as we’ve seen from other (admittedly more expensive) models. Here again, it struggles with outlines… safe to say your DSLR (or mirrorless model) does not need to be disposed of just yet. The OnePlus 11 gives great results when recording 4K and 8K video . You can shoot
        at up to 60fps in 4K and 24fps in 8K. Stabilisation works well to give fairly smooth and steady results when working handheld, though of course dedicated content creators may wish to invest in a gimbal or similar device for the smoothest work. You can also record super-slow video as well as time-lapse options. Overall, while there are some negative comments to be made – mainly in reaction to the claimed prowess of the phone – the OnePlus 11 puts in a great performance for a model of its price and standing. Value for money Coming in at £729 for the 8GB RAM / 128GB model , and £799 for the 16GB RAM / 256GB memory option, the OnePlus 11 is once again significantly cheaper than the flagship models from Apple and Samsung , but is closer in price to the Google Pixel 7 Pro , though even that is more expensive, starting at £849. For the specs you get for the price, the OnePlus is fantastic value for money. You get a well-performing camera with a wide array of features in a device that looks good and has impressive other features such as a long-lasting battery and quick charging. If you’re looking to move away from the hugely expensive prices of the likes of Samsung and Apple, then OnePlus is an excellent option without too much of a sacrifice in image quality.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'There is a lot to like about the iPhone 14 Pro, and it undeniably produces some excellent imagery. It’s fair to say that it’s the best iPhone yet for photographers – but that’s pretty much something we say every time a new one is released. As good as it is, it’s not overwhelmingly exciting, and if you’ve already got an iPhone 13 Pro , there’s not a huge amount here to warrant an upgrade. If you’ve got a 12 Pro or older, it’ll be more of a leap and therefore more worthy of the outlay. Images directly from the camera are very good, with bright, vibrant, and well-detailed images. The new 48-megapixel sensor doesn’t necessarily produce images which are a world away from those made by the 12-megapixel sensor of the iPhone 13 Pro in ordinary or well-lit conditions, but it proves to be useful for digital zoom and in low-light scenarios. It’s a criticism we levy at the iPhone series pretty much every time a new one is released, but we’d love to see more in the way of an enthusiast or professional mode – even if it was a little hidden away within the native app. Yes, there are third-party apps available, but it’s a shame not to have a more comprehensive offering directly from Apple. Lots of people will be devoted iOS users, in which case, the iPhone 14 Pro is certainly the best iPhone there is to date for photography. Go for the Max if you prefer a larger screen, as the cameras are the same between them. If you’re not loyal to Apple, we’d still recommend the Samsung S22 Ultra as the best overall smartphone for photography – particularly if budget is not an issue. With the latter device, you get an extra lens and more flexibility in shooting modes. Overall – the iPhone 14 Pro is an excellent smartphone for photography, and it’s very easy to recommend. Images and video are excellent, and using it is also straightforward. It’s not perfect, but if you’re a fan of iOS it’s unlikely you’ll be disappointed. iPhone vs Android: Which is better for photography? iPhone 14 Pro vs Samsung S23 Ultra: which smartphone is best for photographers? iPhone 14 Pro vs Google Pixel 7 Pro Best smartphones for video in 2023'

      value: 'Apple generally announces a new iPhone every Autumn, with each new iteration promising ever better photographic capabilities. This year’s Apple’s new iPhone models include the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max , with each offering something to appeal to those for whom the camera is the most important specification of their smartphone. In this review, we’ll be concentrating on the iPhone 14 Pro, but it’s worth noting that the iPhone 14 Pro Max has the exact same camera setup – so in terms of picture quality and so on, you can also consider this to be a review of that. iPhone 14 Pro at a glance: Hardware, Design and Features It’s probably fair to say that the iPhone 14 Pro doesn’t represent a huge transformation from its predecessor, but there are still some important changes to consider. For the first time, Apple has pushed past the 12-megapixel barrier, giving us a 48-megapixel sensor for the main wide-angle camera. This is a quad-pixel sensor, meaning that by default, images will still be output at 12 megapixels as the camera uses pixel binning to create the image. You can take advantage of the full 48-megapixel output if you choose to shoot in raw format. Apple does not officially disclose the size of its sensors, but it’s reported that the sensor is a 1/1.28inch type. The 48MP sensor is accompanied by 24mm (equivalent lens) with an aperture of f/1.78 and OIS (optical image stabilisation). This is slightly narrower than last year’s iPhone 13 Pro , which had an f/1.5 aperture – but, if reports that the sensor is larger this time around are true then it should still be better for low light. Further boosts to low-light capability are promised from technologies such as “Deep Fusion” – something which was introduced a couple of iPhone generations back, and new for this model, the “Photonic Engine”. Apple doesn’t go to great lengths to explain what these things mean beyond trusting us to believe in their magic (aka computational photography), but essentially it appears to be taking multiple shots and combining them together for improved detail in low-light scenarios. Joining the 48MP camera are two further 12-megapixel sensors, one offering an ultrawide 13mm equivalent (f/2.2), and a 3x zoom lens – equivalent 77mm f/2.8 with OIS. New for this year is a 2x zoom setting which makes use of the 48MP quad-pixel sensor to crop into the frame. There hasn’t been any evolution of the iPhone’s native camera app, which remains fairly simple in operation, but which includes a Portrait mode plus a Night mode which will automatically activate when light is low. More on the camera app below. You can buy the iPhone 14 Pro or the iPhone 14 Pro Max in a range of storage options. The smallest available is 128GB, which is the size I’ve been using for quite some time with various iPhone models and never had any problems with running out of space. That said, you can’t expand the storage, so if you feel like you’re going to need more, capacities up to 1TB are available, of course at a price premium. In terms of design, Apple hasn’t in any practical terms changed the outward look of the iPhone 14 Pro, with it using the same squared off rounded edges that we’ve seen for a couple of generations. What is slightly different however is the display. The iPhone “notch” has gone, and has been replaced with a pill-shaped cutout which transforms into a “dynamic island” when the phone is doing certain things – such as face recognition. In real terms, it means you get a little bit more display to play with, but not a huge amount. Another new feature is the “Always on” display, which means you can see displays such as the time even when the phone is in sleep mode. This is something which has been available on Android phones for several years, but the good news is that it doesn’t seem to have any major implications for battery life. The iPhone 14 Pro’s 6.1-inch screen makes for a decently sized phone which isn’t too awkward to hold. Some may prefer the larger 6.7-inch Max version, particularly if you like to watch movies or play games on your smartphone – but it’s a little bit more cumbersome to use for day-to-day tasks. The phone has a Ceramic Shield front, as well as a Textured matt glass back and stainless steel design. All of this is designed to be relatively tough and scratch resistant – but it’s probably still a good idea to use a case, particularly as the phone is quite slippy without one. The phone is also splash, water and dust resistant with a rating of IP68, meaning it has been tested to withstand being dunked under water (down to 6 metres) for up to 30 minutes. Apple makes quite a big deal of its video capability, but it’s interesting to note that the company is sticking with 4K, rather than moving towards 8K like some of its rivals (particularly the Samsung S22 Ultra). Still, there’s the option to shoot at up to 60fps, and there’s also HDR with Dolby Vision, plus a ProRes option for video (though you’ll need a
        phone with at least 256GB storage to use ProRes at 4K). Cinematic mode, where a shallow depth of field effect is created has been included once again, with capability of shooting at 4K up to 30fps. Another specification that Apple is coy about is battery. We don’t know the actual size of the battery, but we are told it can provide up to 23 hours of video playback. In our tests, we’ve found it easily lasts a complete day even with relatively heavy use. If you’re shooting a lot of 4K video, you might want to carry a battery pack around with you. Fast charging is available, with up to 50% charge in around 30 minutes with a 20W charger. Wireless charging is also possible. As has been the case for a couple of generations, a charging plug is not included in the box. This is apparently for “environmental” reasons, with the idea being that most of us already own more than enough plugs (probably a fair summation). A USB-C to Lightning cable is provided. Apple iPhone 14 Pro Camera App Apple has been using the same native camera app for its iPhones for quite some time now, albeit with some tweaks and additional features incorporated over the years. It’s disappointing after all this time that Apple still sees fit to ignore pleas for an “advanced” or “pro” mode within the native camera app, but there are hundreds of different third-party apps available which give you this functionality if you require it. It’s also fair to say that the native app being straightforward can be seen as a benefit, giving you scope to concentrate on composition and the like, rather than worrying too much about settings – for many that will be a positive thing. The standard mode you’ll probably use most frequently is the “Photo” mode. From here, you can access all the different lenses (plus the 2x digital zoom option), as well as shoot in raw format and create “Live” photos (whereby a small video accompanies your shot). Tapping around the screen will change the focus point if you need to, and you can also dial in some exposure compensation by moving your finger up and down the screen to add or remove brightness. Holding down your finger on the screen will create an AE/AF lock, so you can focus and recompose if you wish. It’s also in this standard mode that other settings, such as Night and Macro, can be used – albeit they are automatically activated depending on if the phone picks up the right conditions – i.e., dark for Night mode and being close to something for Macro. You have the option to switch off these modes once they are activated if you prefer. Night mode has been around on iPhones for a while and essentially works by grabbing several short exposures and blending them into one image for the best results. The phone will automatically judge how long it needs to record short exposures for, usually depending on exactly how dark it is. If the phone detects it is on a stable surface, it will likely expose for longer. It’s important to keep relatively still for the shots to match up together. Macro mode was introduced for the iPhone 13 Pro so it’s no surprise to see it back for the 14 Pro. If you bring the phone close to a subject, you’ll see it automatically snap into macro mode. It uses the ultra-wide-angle lens to do this, so you might sometimes find you get a better result by turning off macro – which will see the camera return to the standard 48MP lens. It’s worth experimenting with close-ups to see how it works for you. Swiping up on the composition window will see some additional settings you can use, including changing the aspect ratio (4:3, Square and 16:9 are available), adding a filter, or using different Picture Styles. Again, it’s worth experimenting with all of these to see which produces the look you like the best. Picture Styles can also be tweaked to match your own preferences too. The other shooting modes available in the native app include a Portrait mode (for creating shallow depth of field effects), which is primarily intended to be used for people, but also works well with other subjects such as pets, a Video mode, and a Panoramic mode. Performance – Image Quality Apple has been producing extremely capable cameras in its smartphones for many years, so we didn’t expect the iPhone 14 Pro to be any different. While it’s true that it’s not a particularly big leap in quality from its predecessor, that’s perhaps more of a testament to how good the phones are in the first place, rather than a particularly damning indictment. It works well in a good variety of situations, producing pleasing pictures in all sorts of conditions. As we’d expect, the best results are seen from the main lens, with the new 48-megapixel sensor producing excellent results (albeit not a noticeably vast improvement from the iPhone 13 Pro ). The ultra-wide-angle lens also produces excellent results, with little distortion, though it struggles a little in very low light to produce the same kind of clean images that the main sensor can muster up (as
        we’d expect). Where the 48MP sensor comes in particularly useful is when shooting at the new 2x option, as not only do you get excellent flexibility to choose between 1x, 2x and 3x options, but it also produces good images in low light thanks to the wider aperture lens in conjunction with the very good Night mode. The 1x sensor will automatically kick in if you’re shooting at very low light and want to shoot at 3x too. It’ll just crop into the image it takes. Further digital zoom is available, but we’d probably avoid using that in most situations unless absolutely desperate to get closer to the subject. Macro mode is something we saw in the last iPhone and once again here it produces excellent results when you want to get very close to a subject. The detail produced is wonderful, and it’s great to have that option available. Another mode which has been around for a while is Portrait mode. It continues to work well here, producing pleasing results even with relatively fussy outlines. New here for the 14 Pro is the option to choose between 1x, 2x and 3x, so there’s a bit more flexibility when compared to the 13 Pro. Apple iPhone 14 Pro Value for Money Apple is not exactly known for producing cheap smartphones, but in comparison to other flagship smartphones, the iPhone 14 Pro isn’t too badly priced. The smallest capacity iPhone 14 Pro is cheaper than the lowest capacity Samsung S22 Ultra , for example, making it quite competitively priced. Of course, it still costs over £1000, making it expensive for anybody on a strict budget. If you want an iPhone but have more limited funds, your options are to look for an older version (the iPhone 13 Pro for example, which isn’t massively dissimilar) or plump for the non-Pro version of the iPhone 14 – where you’ll lose the additional lens and a few other features. Another option, particularly if you want to save money, is to look at the Google Pixel 7 Pro , which is available for £849.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: With the release of PureRAW, DxO has thrown us something of a curve ball. We haven’t seen anything quite like this before, and it might be difficult for prospective users to see the point in spending a substantial sum of money on a program that converts camera raw files to DNGs. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and if you’re a dyed-in-the-wool Adobe user, PureRAW can usefully expand the scope of what you can do with your files, particularly those shot at high ISOs or with less-than-perfect lenses. In this review I’ve deliberately selected examples that nicely illustrate PureRAW’s potential to give improved results with technically compromised raw files, but each user will get different benefits, depending on the kit they use and how they shoot. Thankfully DxO offers a 30-day free trial, so you can download and try it for yourself. Personally, I can see PureRAW becoming an important component of my image-processing toolkit.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'DxO PureRAW at a glance: French software company DxO has a long and distinguished history in digital imaging. It was the first to fully understand and implement the concept of profiled lens aberration corrections with its original Optics Pro software, which it introduced way back in 2004. Since then, the firm has built up a vast database of lens/camera profiles, while the software itself has morphed into a fully-fledged raw converter, DxO PhotoLab. Along the way, DxO has also developed some class-leading demosaicing and noise reduction technologies. In particular, its latest AI-based DeepPRIME denoising, introduced in PhotoLab 4, can lay serious claim to being the best currently available. However, the firm has also recognised a fundamental reality of the imaging software market. Most people tend to learn a program and stick with it, the Adobe being the 800-pound gorilla in this particular space. No matter how much photographers may grumble about its subscription-only model, the fact remains that a sizeable number of them are locked into using Photoshop and/or Lightroom, because ultimately, they’re incredibly capable industry-standard programs. Other users may have a soft spot for the likes of Serif Affinity Photo or Skylum Luminar. As a result, DxO’s ability to sell PhotoLab is limited by factors other than the quality of its output. In a stroke of imagination, DxO has come up with a unique solution. Its latest program isn’t a raw converter in the conventional sense, in that it doesn’t output finished image files. Instead, it can be thought of as a pre-converter, which takes the raw data from your camera and applies demosaicing, noise reduction and lens corrections to produce an intermediate DNG file, which aims to represent the purest possible reconstruction of the image that was in front of the camera. This DNG can then be used as a starting point in other programs for the creative side of image development – tonal and colour corrections, pre-sets, LUTs and so on – exactly like a conventional camera raw file. The idea is that you get the best of both worlds: all of DxO’s image reconstruction expertise, coupled with the familiarity of your preferred software and workflow. It’s a really clever concept, but how well does it work, and is it worth buying? How to use DxO PureRAW At heart, DxO PureRAW is a pretty simple program. The first time you open it after installation, it provides a brief walk-though of the basic concept. Then you just have to load up raw files that you’d like to convert, which will appear in its main window as thumbnails arranged by the date they were taken. The software will first attempt to identify which camera and lens combination you used for each image, so it can download the requisite correction profiles. It’s important to pay attention here because there can be ambiguities between similar lenses, at which point the software will offer you a choice of profiles. Select the wrong one and you’ll get imperfect results. Once the software has downloaded the lens profiles, it’s just a case of selecting the raw files and converting them. The only real control that you’re offered is a choice between three noise reduction algorithms, HQ, PRIME, or DeepPRIME, with the trade-off being processing time against effectiveness. Even if your computer has a modern, powerful processor, DeepPRIME can take almost a minute to chew through a 24MP raw file, so you might prefer to reserve it for use with high ISO files where its benefits are greatest. There’s also the option of converting directly to JPEG rather than DNG, but with no control over colour, white balance, brightness or tonality within PureRAW, it’s difficult to see much point in doing this. Press the ‘Process photos’ button, and the software will proceed to convert your camera raw files to 16-bit Linear DNGs. By default, they’ll be saved in a DxO sub-folder within their original location, but you can change this if you want. This isn’t quite all the program does, though. Once the files are converted, PureRAW can display a split screen before-and-after view, showing you how much improvement it’s made to the original file. Most usefully, the software can also send its DNGs to external software such as Lightroom or Photoshop for development; if you select the latter, they’ll open in Adobe Camera Raw. Even better, it can send the original raw file alongside, which allows you to copy its development settings to the new re-processed version and compare the two. So if you’ve previously spent time working on the original raw file, you don’t have to replicate that effort all over again. However, you may still need to make a few additional tweaks to get the PureRAW version to match your previous processing perfectly. Is DxO PureRAW worth using? To establish what benefits you might gain from using PureRAW, I tested it with a wide range of raw files from cameras both new and old, with both affordable and premium lenses, and across a full range
        of sensor sizes. By considering what the program claims to do, though, it’s easy enough to predict when it should be most beneficial. If your raw files are already technically excellent – in other words, shot on a modern full-frame sensor at low ISO, with top notch lenses and perfectly controlled lighting – it’s unlikely to buy you much advantage. If on the other hand you have files that were shot at high ISOs, using relatively inexpensive lenses, with smaller-sensor systems or simply old camera models, then you potentially have much more to gain. What certainly surprised me, though, is just how significant the improvements can be. To illustrate this, let’s look at some examples of how the output from PureRAW compares to that produced by Adobe Camera Raw. DxO PureRAW example one – Noise reduction Firstly, let’s examine an image I took using the Canon PowerShot G3 X, a bridge camera with a 1-inch sensor and a 24-600mm equivalent lens. One of my favourite pictures from this camera was of a neighbourhood cat perched on a brick wall, staring at me disapprovingly against a lovely soft blurred background. It’s shot at 600mm equivalent, where the lens is weakest, and ISO 1000, which is visibly noisy. The PureRAW version is vastly better than Adobe’s effort, retaining much more detail in the cat’s fur, while smoothing away all traces of noise in the bokeh. This is fundamentally what DeepPRIME is designed to do, and it certainly delivers the goods, effectively making the image look like it was shot at a lower ISO. There’s still a degree of ‘waxiness’ if you look at the background closely onscreen, but this shouldn’t be a problem in print. DxO PureRAW example two – Dynamic range Second is a related concept, but instead of mid-tone noise, we’re concerned about the type of shadow noise that can become troublesome when making significant tonal adjustments in raw processing. I shot this image using my Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II, exposing to retain highlight detail in the illuminated buildings in the pre-dawn light, and using ISO 400 to keep the shutter speed high enough to hand-hold. Little detail in the gorge is visible in the original JPEG; instead I’ve pulled it up using exposure and shadow adjustments in raw processing. In the Adobe version there’s a fair amount of blotchy colour noise visible, but DeepPRIME suppresses it without any loss of detail. In effect, DxO’s processing has extended the raw file’s usable dynamic range, counteracting one of the perceived weaknesses of smaller sensors. DxO PureRAW example three – Old camera, soft lens This comparison illustrates DxO’s other main area of expertise – that of lens corrections. I took this photo in 2005 using an 8MP Canon EOS 350D, coupled with the decade-older Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM. This was the world’s first image-stabilised SLR lens, and it wasn’t very sharp, especially at 300mm f/5.6 as used here. Incidentally this is also an example where DxO couldn’t unambiguously identify the lens from the file’s EXIF data, so I had to manually select the profile for the stabilised version. What PureRAW has achieved with this file is impressive, teasing out texture in the elephant’s hide that’s barely visible in the Adobe version. As a result, it’s done a fine job of reviving an old, relatively poor-quality file to something that I’d now happily print rather larger than before. I’m not going to pretend that the results are as good as if I’d used a modern lens and camera, but that’s really not the point. DxO PureRAW example four – High-quality file Finally, let’s look at an example where you’d probably assume PureRAW can’t provide so much in the way of improvement. This picture is of a professionally made-up model at Leica’s launch event for the full-frame 24MP full-frame SL, photographed using the SL 24-90mm f/2.8-4 ASPH zoom, a no-compromise optic that costs over £4000. It’s taken at f/5.6, which is perhaps the lens’s sharpest aperture, using studio flash. Technically, the raw file is practically flawless, and it’s difficult to pick much argument with Adobe’s rendition. However, the PureRAW version is visibly much sharper. Whether this is what you want with portraits is an entirely different matter. DxO PureRAW camera and lens support While DxO PureRAW works with a vast range of cameras and lenses, there are a few exceptions. The most glaring and unfortunate is that the firm has never supported Fujifilm’s X-Trans colour filter array, so users of the excellent APS-C X-system cameras will have to live without it. Some very old raw files might not work either; for example, I was unable to persuade it to recognise Canon’s original CRW format from the early 2000s. At the other end of the scale, DxO can take a little while to add the latest lenses to its database; at the time of writing there’s no profile for the 10-month-old Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG DN OS.'

      value: Andy Westlake tries out a versatile option for carrying your kit in our Vanguard VEO BIB F33 Bag-in-Bag review
    - type: conclusion
      value: The Vanguard VEO BIB F33 is one of the larger bags of this type that you’ll find. With its square shape, it’ll fit nicely into a case or backpack, and it offers good protection for your kit. I particularly appreciated the way it allowed me to carry around a significant quality of kit in an innocuous looking backpack. The option to carry it with its own strap is a handy bonus too; just don’t rely on doing so for a long time.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Vanguard’s Bag-in-Bag (BIB) range comprises padded inserts of various sizes for holding camera kit, which allow you to use your favourite shoulder bag, backpack, or roller case as a camera bag. Previously these bags were very basic, but the firm revamped them in late 2022 with radically improved construction and functionality. With dual top and front openings, the Vanguard VEO BIB F33 is a one of the firm’s larger offerings, and designed to be carried inside a backpack. Vanguard VEO BIB F33 Bag-in-Bag at a glance: At nearly 32cm square and 20cm deep , this is a fairly sizeable bag that’ll accommodate plenty of kit. It comes with lots of dividers that you should be able to arrange to suit your needs, and which don’t occupy excessive space thanks to their nice slim profile. In terms of capacity, it’ll take a full-frame DSLR or mirrorless camera and five lenses , including a large telephoto zoom. I fitted in a Sony Alpha A 7 IV with Sigma 100-400mm zoom and Newell vertical grip attached, plus 16-35mm f/4 , 24-105mm f/4 , 50mm f/1.4 and 90mm f/2.8 macro lenses, along with a small flash unit . Vanguard VEO BIB F33 Bag-in-Bag key features: As an additional trick, the BIB F33 comes with a detachable strap that can be used in one of two ways. Clipped to D-rings either side at the top, it allows you to carry the bag either on your shoulder or across your body . Clipped to loops at the base and fed through another large loop at the top, it works as a basic backpack . However, as the bag can easily reach 6kg fully laden and the strap is entirely unpadded, this is very much a short-term solution, and not something you’d want to do all day. I found it tolerable in backpack mode for a half-hour walk, but distinctly uncomfortable as a shoulder bag for even a short time. Unsurprisingly, by the far the best option is to carry it inside a proper backpack. There’s also a well-padded carry handle on top. Just as we’d expect from Vanguard, construction quality is very high, with tough, waterproof nylon exterior fabric and generous padding all round. I’m not convinced the zip openings would stand up to being exposed to a downpour, though, but that’s one reason why ‘proper’ bags cost more. It’s also worth noting that you won’t find any external pockets for personal items or a water bottle. If you like the idea of this kind of insert bag, but it’s not the right size, Vanguard’s VEO BIB range includes 11 bags of three types of design. There are three in the top-loading T series, which are designed for shoulder/messenger bags; four in the F series; and four in the Divider series, which are designed for Vanguard’s Supreme tough cases. Prices range from $35 to $220 / £30 to £180.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The Newell NP-FZ100 USB-C onboard battery isn’t cheap, and it’s fair to question why you’d pay extra compared to the manufacturer’s original. But buying one of these is almost like getting two top-quality spares at once. If you’re anticipating a heavy day’s shooting, use this one from the start, recharge it from a power bank, and you can use it again later. Overall, the sheer usefulness of built-in USB-C charging may well be worth the premium to many users.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Newell NP-FZ100 USB-C onboard battery is a replacement camera battery with an extremely handy trick. It has a built-in USB-C port, which means you can top it up directly from any suitable power source such as a powerbank, without needing a charger. Any photographer who’s found themselves desperately conserving the last of their battery life at the end of a day will surely understand the attraction. Newell NP-FZ100 USB-C onboard battery at a glance: This particular NP-FZ100 model is compatible with a range of Sony cameras. These include full-frame Alpha 7-series models from the third generation onwards, including the latest Alpha A7R V ; the Alpha 1 and Alpha 9 series; the APS-C Alpha 6600 ; and FX-series cinema cameras such as the FX30 . Newell also makes USB-C charging batteries for higher-end Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm and OM System models. I suspect some readers will be wary of the idea of using any third-party battery in their camera. It’s easy to assume that they’ll inevitably be inferior to the camera makers’ originals, which is usually the case with cheap offerings from online marketplaces. But we’re not talking about cheap here – indeed Newell’s USB-C batteries are a little pricier than the manufacturers’ originals. Notably, the firm is sufficiently confident in their quality to promise a 40-month warranty . Newell NP-FZ100 USB-C onboard battery key features: I’ve been using this battery regularly in my Sony Alpha 7R IV for about 8 months now, and it behaves much like the standard Sony battery – just with the additional benefit of being really easy to recharge on the go . In my experience, it provides pretty much the same lifespan as the Sony battery with a mix of shooting stills and video, playing back images, and copying a few across to your phone for sharing. It’ll then recharge in about the same time afterwards. Once charged, it holds power reliably for weeks with no internal drain. For a more quantitative comparison, I measured how long the Newell NP-FZ100 USB-C battery would support video recording at the A7R IV’s highest setting of 4K 30p and 100Mbps. It came within a couple of minutes of matching a Sony NP-FZ100, with both lasting almost exactly two hours. Crucially, the Newell battery isn’t picky about needing a high-power USB source to replenish. It’ll charge perfectly happily from a standard 1A USB-A powerbank output, going from near-empty to 50% in about an hour. A full charge takes three to four hours . Just be aware that you can’t always go by the charge status LED, as with some power sources it won’t ever go green, even when the camera’s battery meter reads 100%. Newell USB battery chargers Newell also makes a variety of high-quality chargers. I like its compact FDL-USB-C series model, which charges two batteries at once, with a status display detailing progress. It has both a USB-C input port and a built-in USB-A cable. It’s available for a wide range of battery types for £29.'

      value: Andy Westlake tests Rode’s updated compact on-camera microphone, the Rode VideoMicro II
    - type: conclusion
      value: With the VideoMicro II, Rode has reinvented its basic on-camera mic, with an array of useful improvements that justify its higher price. As a simple, compact, lightweight, analogue microphone that offers very decent sound, it’s difficult to beat. If you want to improve your audio with a small on-camera microphone that works effectively with the minimum of fuss, it comes highly recommended.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Rode VideoMicro II is an update to the firm’s hugely popular, and much-imitated, compact on-camera microphone, the Rode VideoMicro . Compared to the original, it gains some significant spec upgrades, and comes with a wider range of accessories. Clearly, the aim is to provide an even more user-friendly package that’s better suited for use with smartphones as well as cameras. Naturally, though, this comes with an increase in price. Rode VideoMicro II at a glance: As before, this is a small, lightweight unit which is designed to pick up sound primarily from in front of the camera, and then output it as dual-channel mono (in other words, with the same signal recorded to both left and right audio channels). Its frequency response is specified as 20Hz-20kHz, extended from 100Hz-20KHz before. It’s a purely analogue design – there’s no digital output over USB. Rode now describes the sensitivity pattern as supercardioid , in contrast to the original’s cardioid. This means it should reject ambient sounds from the sides more effectively, but be slightly more sensitive directly to the rear. This is a sensible choice for those who may wish either to hold a conversation from behind the camera, or to commentate on what’s in front of them. Rode VideoMicro II key features: In design terms, the most striking change is the new Helix anti-shock mount , which aims to isolate the microphone from camera operational noises. It’s a real practical advance over the original’s Lyre mount, as it’s more compact and the mic is no longer prone to drooping forwards under its own weight. As this mount design holds the microphone further forward on a camera’s hot shoe, it’s also better for shooting video using the viewfinder, as the cable is no longer prone to bumping against your forehead. As the icing on the cake, it looks like the mount should be rather more robust, too. A new straight, flat 3.5mm TRS audio cable is supplied for connecting to a camera. This design works better with cameras whose microphone ports are situated some distance from the hot shoe, where the previous coiled cable could get over-stretched. You also get a TRRS smartphone cable in the box (which previously was an optional extra), although with most phones, you’ll still need a 3.5mm USB-C or Lightning audio adapter. Both cables can be tucked into slots on the shoe mount to stop them from rattling around. In use, the Rode VideoMicro II delivers high quality sound that’s a dramatic improvement over most camera’s built-in microphones. It’s much better at picking up voices either in front of, or behind the camera, while the furry windshield is impressively effective at suppressing wind noise outdoors. The audio quality is a clear advance over its predecessor, too, with increased sensitivity and extended bass response providing extra clarity and depth to vocals. It is, however, also worth considering Rode’s next model up, the the Rode VideoMic Go II . This offers increased versatility, including digital USB audio output for smartphones and computers, plus adjustable settings via the Rode Connect app. It’s somewhat larger, at 15cm long and 96g in weight, but not too much more expensive, at $99 / £89.'

      value: Andy Westlake tests a large, sturdy and yet relatively affordable aluminium tripod in our 3 Legged Thing Charles 2.0 review
    - type: conclusion
      value: There’s nothing very flashy about the 3 Legged Thing Charles 2.0, with its matte black finish and utilitarian design. But it does the job it’s designed to do, and does it well. If you want a large, robust tripod and are happy carrying around something this size, it’s a solid option for serious landscape photographers at a competitive price.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'While many tripods now make a virtue of being as small and lightweight as possible, the 3 Legged Thing Charles 2.0 goes in completely the opposite direction. It’s a large and fairly heavy unit which, with its 3-section aluminium-alloy design, almost feels like a throwback to an earlier age. But there’s good reason for this, as where tripods are concerned, size and weight equate directly to stability, especially when shooting outdoors with heavier cameras and lenses. The Charles 2.0 is therefore designed to appeal to photographers who shoot subjects such as landscapes and astrophotography. 3 Legged Thing Charles 2.0 at a glance: The benefit of those long legs is, of course, height; even in its most stable configuration with the centre column retracted, this tripod will lift a camera to 1.5m, which isn’t far off eye level for me as a six-footer. At its maximum extension, it’ll get to over 1.9m. That gives plenty of leeway when you need it, for example when shooting on sloping ground. Each of the legs can be set independently to three different angles, and they reverse fold to reduce the packed length. However at 61.2cm when folded, it’s still pretty sizeable. For low-level shooting, the centre column can be removed, and the head platform transferred onto the central spider to get down as low as 23cm. Alternatively, the centre column can be inverted and the camera slung underneath, although this is always an awkward way of working. 3 Legged Thing Charles 2.0 key features: All three legs can be unscrewed, and any one of them attached to the centre column to make a similarly huge monopod. However, it’s worth noting that none of them has a foam or rubber grip, and aluminium alloy is notoriously uncomfortable to handle in cold weather. Turning our attention to the Airhed Pro ball head , this has separate locks for the ball and the panning base. I found that the former gave no real control over friction, going from locked to completely loose in a fraction of a turn. So you must remember to keep hold of your camera whenever you undo it, to avoid expensive mishaps. On a more positive note, though, the head allows precise adjustment, and then locks down firmly without the slightest shift in composition. While the ball lock screw is captive, the pan lock control isn’t. But thankfully, it has a very long way to unscrew before it’ll fall out. At 2.4kg including the head, this is a lot heavier than most tripods now on the market, but not unduly so given its height. However, if you’re expecting to carry it around a lot, it’s worth considering the firm’s carbon-fibre Winston 2.0 version instead. This is the same size and is rated to support the same load, but 390g lighter. It’s not that much more expensive, at $400/ £280 for the legs and $500/£339 for the kit. I tested the Charles 2.0 with a Nikon Z8 and Nikkor Z 100-400mm lens, which it handled with ease. However, while it’s sturdy and will clearly support much heavier kit, it visibly doesn’t dampen vibrations as quickly or effectively as a carbon-fibre tripod would. It’s important to wait a couple of seconds for everything to settle down after adjusting the camera, and then use some kind of remote release. Optional Footwear 3 Legged Thing offers a range of optional screw-in footwear in place of in place of the standard rubber feet, for use on different surfaces. Clawz are for snow or ice, Heelz for hard surfaces like concrete, and Stilletoz for soft ground. Finally, Vanz are hybrid long spikes/rubber feet. Prices range from £40 to £60 per set.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: Kingston’s XS2000 range of pocket-sized SSD drives are ideal backup and working drives for photographers and filmmakers on the go. Available in four capacities, the 2TB model should provide ample storage for most users. While achieving maximum potential speeds requires a specific USB 3.2 Gen. 2×2 port, the XS2000 still offers reliable and fast performance on other computers. While faster and more expensive USB 4 options are now available, the Kingston XS2000 is a competitive option that provides good value for its specifications.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Kingston’s XS2000 range of SSD drives are genuinely pocket-sized storage devices that offer incredible speeds to photographers and filmmaking wishing to work on the move. I tried the Kingston XS2000 2TB SSD drive, which should offer enough storage space for most photographers to back up a significant amount of their photo or video projects for use on the move or as additional temporary storage. The same drive is available in four capacities, 512MB, 1TB, 2TB and an impressive 4TB. Kingston XS2000 2TB SSD at a glance: Kingston quotes the drive as having a maximum potential speed of 2,000MB/s for both read and write, which is impressive, but it does come with a caveat. To obtain the fastest speeds, you must have a computer that states explicitly it uses USB 3.2 Gen. 2×2 . Many computers have bypassed USB 3.2 2×2 and will be either the older USB 3.2 or the newer USB 4, which is faster but not compatible with USB 3.2 Gen. 2×2. So the XS2000 will work, but not to its full potential. Kingston XS2000 2TB SSD key features: I tried it with my Macbook Air M1, which is USB 3.2 Gen 2, so the drive has a theoretical maximum of 1,200MB/s. Using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test, I achieved a read speed of 673MB/s and a write speed of 561MB/s. Even at these speeds, the software showed I could use the drive to record up to 12K raw video footage at 24fps. On my PC, I used CrystalDiskMark 7 on the motherboard’s USB 3.2 port and achieved a read speed of 944MB/S and a write speed of 1035MB/s. I added USB 3.2 Gen. 2×2 card via a PCI port on my motherboard, specifically for this review, and got a read speed of 1588MB/s and a write speed of 1461MB/s – both of which are impressively fast. It is worth noting that results will vary depending on your computer’s specifications, and other reviews have been able to get much closer to the quoted maximum read and write speed. Capacities and pricing Kingston offers the XS2000 SSD drive in 500GB, 1TB, 2TB and 4TB capacities. All are the same physical size and offer the same read/write speeds via their USB 3.2 Gen. 2×2 connector. In the US, they can be bought from Kingston’s website for $74.99, $114.99, $214.99 and $499.99. Meanwhile, UK RRPs are £86.99, £122.99, £228.99 and £369.99 respectively. This counts as competitive value for an SSD of this specification.'

      value: Andy Westlake examines a colour calibration target for both photo and video use in our Calibrite ColorChecker Passport Duo review
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Calibrite ColorChecker Passport Duo at a glance: The Calibrite ColorChecker Passport Duo is a pocket-sized calibration target that aims to help you achieve perfect colour . Designed for hybrid users who shoot both still and moving images , it includes photo-centric elements of the firm’s existing ColorChecker Passport Photo 2, while adding a pair of targets from the ColorChecker Passport Video that are specifically designed to aid a video production workflow . But this brings a significant increase in price over either, to $199 / £199 . So is it worth the money? Calibrite ColorChecker Passport Duo key features: As with previous versions of the ColorChecker Passport, you get a sturdy black plastic casing measuring 12.5 x 9 cm that will fit easily into a camera bag or pocket, and which folds open to reveal a set of four calibration targets. For stills, there’s a pale grey white-balance card , along with a standard 24-colour target . The latter can be used either as a simple visual reference tool, or to create a colour profile for your camera using Calibrite’s accompanying software. The resultant DCP file can then be used in imaging programs such as Adobe Camera Raw or Lightroom . Turning our attention to the video section, firstly there’s a 24-patch target , including a row of six primary colours (yellow, red, magenta, blue, cyan, and green). These are designed to align with Vectorscope colour visualisation displays; when your white balance is correct, you should see a centred star pattern, with six arms pointing out symmetrically. A further six panels aim to represent a broad range of skin tones . Then there’s a greyscale across two rows, with extended highlight and shadow coverage (i.e. brighter whites and deeper blacks). The fourth target is a three-step greyscale with white, mid-grey (40 IRE), and deep black panels. This provides a simple way of checking exposure using a waveform display, as you get three horizontal lines representing highlights, mid-tones and blacks. One thing to look out for here, though, is that the black target has a glossy finish, so can be prone to picking up reflections (you can see this in the opening image at the top of this review). Camera Calibration software Creating a camera profile is straightforward. Shoot the 24-colour target in raw, then convert to DNG. Drag this file into the Calibrite ColorChecker Camera Calibration software, and it’ll do the rest automatically. Creating a profile takes a little while, but the resultant DCP file can be used by a range of different image processing programs. Any profiles you create will also appear alongside other camera colour profiles in Adobe software, which I find more a logical way of working than the Presets created by the rival Datacolor Spyder Checkr Photo . You can also create a dual-illuminant profile, using raw files shot under daylight and artificial light. This should give more consistent results when processing files shot under different lighting conditions. It’s worth noting that the software works with all Calibrite or X-Rite classic 24-colour targets; you don’t specifically need the Passport Duo.'

      value: A long-time Instax Mini 8 user, Isabella Ruffatti tries out the new Instax Mini 12 and finds out how it compares.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'I’ve had my Instax Mini 8 for six years now, since my first year in university, and used it first to document my everyday life and recently for more ‘serious photography’ . When Fujifilm released its latest Instax model, the Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 , I was curious to see how it had upgraded the camera, especially as the Mini 12 only has two modes compared to the Mini 8’s five modes. The latest model boasts automatic exposure and flash control, and a handy selfie mirror. Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 at a glance: INSTAX UP! App When this camera was announced, an accompanying app, the INSTAX UP! App , was released too. It can be used to scan, store, edit and organise your instant photos (mini, square, and wide). You can also share your images directly to social media I was quite happy with the results from copying my prints using the app. It was like having OneDrive (which I used to scan things previously) and Adobe Lightroom in one app. In some cases, further tweaking was necessary, as the app does not always detect the edges of a print accurately (which can be time-consuming when you’re scanning 20 prints in one go, as I was). Also my phone (an iPhone 8 Plus) got hot and went from 40% to 14% in around twenty minutes. Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 key features: Fujifilm Instax Mini 12: Camera body and design The Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 is smaller and lighter than the Instax Mini 8 , something that I did not notice until I put it into a camera bag I bought for the Mini 8, and it looked like me in ill-fitting jeans. The design is also boxier – and relatively slippery . As someone who’s ever anxious about dropping my camera (which has only ever happened once or twice, but that’s anxiety for you), this took some getting used to. Fujifilm Instax Mini 12: The shooting experience Despite the upgrades, the shooting experience with the Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 felt largely the same (like a random, but fun, science experiment). I did find that the Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 was easier to shoot with and did not feel the loss of the many modes of the Mini 8, which gives you the option to select a different mode depending on the lighting conditions around you. This is a good idea in theory, but in practice, I saw very little difference in my results, and I found myself manually using flash for almost every photo. The Mini 12’s results were still fairly random, but I expected this given the minimal settings available. Fujifilm Instax Mini 12: The final product All the images I took using the Close-up mode came out blurry , though to be fair I may have been too close. I still would not say that the camera lends itself to close-ups, as on one occasion I tried shooting my Sylvanian families figurines and they came out looking as though they were in a negative (and the Psycho soundtrack rang in my ears). That said, this camera really shines in taking selfies and portraits and took some nice travel snapshots from afar too.'

      value: Eizo monitors have an excellent reputation but they don’t come cheap. Angela Nicholson takes a look the Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X to find out if it’s worth the asking price.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X at a glance: The Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X is a 27-inch monitor with a viewable area of 596.2 x 335.3 mm and a native resolution of 3840 x 2160 (4K) . This makes its pixel pitch 0.155 x 0.155 mm, which helps to ensure a clear, sharp view of images and video. As a 10-bit display , it can show up to 1.07 billion colours, which means that colour gradations are smooth. Eizo states that it’s able to reproduce 99% of the Adobe RGB colour space that’s frequently used in photography, and 98% of the DCI-P3 standard used in digital cinema. It can also be set to one of nine display modes including AdobeRGB, sRGB, BT.2020, BT.709, DCI-P3, PQ_DCI-P3, HLG_BT.2100, Calibration (CAL), SYNC_SIGNAL and User, all of which can be customised.  BT.2020 is a popular choice in broadcasting while HLG (hybrid log-gamma) and PQ (perceptual quantization) are designed for displaying and editing HDR (high dynamic range) content. Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X key features: Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X: Set-up Large computer monitors are cumbersome and usually awkward to handle, but the Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X comes with its stand attached and it has a handle to make it easy to lift into place. With it positioned on a desk, the next step is to connect it to the power and a computer. This task is made easier by the fact that the stand allows the screen to be rotated through 90° clockwise. This means that the connection ports that normally face downwards can be switched to face sideways for easier access. Although it has HDMI and display ports , the CG2700X also has a USB-C port that can act as a display port and offer power delivery. It means that you can connect modern laptops and computers quickly and use the monitor to supply the laptop’s power. The stand supplied with the monitor is height-adjustable across a range of 15.5cm .  It also allows the screen to be tilted up through 35° or down through 5° so you can find a comfortable viewing position. As I mentioned previously, the screen can be rotated through 90° clockwise to give portrait orientation images more room. Eizo supplies a pre-assembled hood that attaches magnetically. It snaps smartly into place when the monitor is in landscape orientation but must be removed if the screen is rotated into portrait orientation. A row of touch-tensive buttons on the bottom right edge of the monitor give you quick control over its key settings, but the ColorNavigator 7 interface is a more attractive option. Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X: Calibration All monitors need to be calibrated to ensure that they show colours accurately, and the CG2700X has a calibration system built-in . This comes in the form of a calibration device that rotates down from inside the top of the screen surround to cover a small section at the top of the display. It works with Eizo’s free ColorNavigator 7 software which should be downloaded, installed and used before the monitor is used for any colour-critical work. Although there’s a calibrator built-in, the ColorNavigator 7 software allows you to use an alternative device if you wish. When the integrated system is used, a series of colour rectangles are displayed under the calibrator while it takes measurements before creating the profile. The software only takes a couple of minutes to run though the calibration process and it can be set to operate automatically at regular intervals at a time of your choosing.  Conveniently, the monitor is calibrated for all of the available display modes at the same time so if you switch from viewing an image in Adobe ARG to sRBG, there’s no need to recalibrate. ColorNavigator 7 is easy to use but it also has plenty of features for advanced users. It can even be used to control a collection of monitors in a network to ensure they all show colours in the same way. Eizo ColorEdge CG2700X: Working in portrait orientation The stand supplied with the CG2700X feels solid and well-made, and it’s easy to rotate the monitor between landscape and portrait orientation. If you’ve shot a lot of portrait orientation images, it might be helpful to rotate the screen to accommodate them. However, the computer also needs to be told to rotate the display in order for the images to be the right way around and the editing software panels are likely to need rearranging to make the best use of the 9:16 screen. Consequently, it’s best to process all your portrait orientation images in a batch rather than continually switch between orientations.'

      value: Andy Westlake tests a compact, high quality stereo audio recorder in our OM System LS-P5 review
    - type: conclusion
      value: The OM System LS-P5 combines pocket-friendly portability with extremely high-quality sound capture and recording. It’s complete overkill for simple purposes like voice notes, but should be a handy tool for videographers requiring top-notch audio.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'OM System LS-P5 at a glance: When the Olympus camera division split off to form OM Digital Solutions , the firm’s audio recording business was part of the deal. Its first product under the new brand, the OM System LS-P5 , is a successor to the Olympus LS-P4. This means that it’s a compact, high-quality stereo audio recorder, which uses a third microphone for extended bass response. However, it now sports an updated microphone system designed to cope with louder sounds. It also benefits from enhanced smartphone remote control via Bluetooth, along with a host of other tweaks that make it a more practical device for capturing video soundtracks, or making high-quality field recordings. OM System LS-P5 key features: Physically the new model looks much as before, with three microphones at the front, a small square dot matrix display, and the same button layout. Its Tresmic II system provides zoomable stereo output, ranging from a wide 180° soundstage to focusing narrowly in front of the device, shotgun-style. You can record in qualities up to 96KHz / 24-bit , using either the lossy MP3 format, lossless compressed FLAC , or uncompressed WAV . In place of the LS-P4’s sliding USB-A plug, there’s now a micro-USB port for charging the batteries and connecting to a computer (it’s a shame this isn’t USB-C). You also get a conventional tripod socket , eliminating the need for an annoying adapter, and it’s well placed so the recorder doesn’t jut out behind the camera when mounted on its hot shoe. The 3.5mm stereo input and output sockets have moved onto the left side, which is more convenient for wiring the device to your camera. About the only thing that might count as a downgrade is that the body is now plastic, rather than metal. But this helps keep the weight down to 78g , with the OM System LS-P5 measuring a pocket-friendly 112 x 37 x 16mm . The kit’s quite sparse, with just the batteries and a short USB cable supplied. The onscreen menus and controls now look distinctly dated, but this is partially offset by the new app. As well as recording with the built-in mic, you can plug in an external microphone such a Lavalier unit. You can also output audio to your camera via the headphone socket, while simultaneously recording on the device itself and monitoring via Bluetooth headphones . However, the latter suffers from a distinct delay (latency), which isn’t necessarily a problem if you’re just checking sound levels, but is disconcerting during recording. Most importantly, audio quality is excellent. Voices are clear and distinct, while with ambient sounds, the device deals with noisy traffic or quiet birdsong with equal aplomb. However, wind noise can be picked up very easily outdoors, so it’s a shame no windshield is included (third party options are available online for about £23). For on-camera use, you’ll probably want to add an anti-shock mount, too. Smartphone control via the DVR-Remote app Using the DVR.Remote app, you get extensive remote control from your phone via Bluetooth. The main screen provides the recording and sound level controls, with large, clear meter displays. You can also add index marks, rename files, change the recording quality, and zoom the microphone, all without having to touch the device.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: With its unusual design and $499 / £499 price tag, the Vanguard VEO 3+ 303CBS is a tripod for serious photographers who know exactly what they need. It lets you position your camera practically anywhere and at almost any angle you like, and will then hold it firmly in place. Naturally, there are limits to what is sensible. But as long as it’s used with a good dose of common sense regarding what’ll be stable and what won’t, this is one of the most versatile tripods you could wish for.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Vanguard VEO 3+ 303CBS at a glance: With many tripods now aiming to be as compact and travel friendly as possible, it’s refreshing to come across one that’s a bit different. The Vanguard VEO 3+ 303CBS is the largest and sturdiest model in the firm’s range of versatile tripods with tilting centre columns . It employs three-section carbon fibre legs with twist locks to deliver an impressive maximum height of 1.77m , and comes in a kit with a well-matched ball head. Unashamedly built with stability and versatility in mind, this tripod should be particularly interesting to landscape and macro photographers , who will often find themselves shooting on uneven ground and looking to fix their cameras in awkward positions to enable interesting compositions. To this end, the legs can be independently set to three different angles, including almost completely flat, while the centre column can be tilted and rotated to practically any angle you choose. The supplied BH-250S ball head is impressively hefty and includes a friction adjustment control to deal with different-sized loads. It also employs a dual panning design, with both a rotating base and a rotating Arca-Swiss type camera clamp. I found the latter to be especially handy for fine-tuning composition with the column set horizontally. Overall, the head complements the leg set perfectly, with the combination offering an unmatched level of versatility. Vanguard VEO 3+ 303CBS: key features The tripod is supplied in a comprehensive kit with a full set of accessories. Vanguard VEO 3+ 303CBS in use: Given all the adjustments that are available, this tripod has more controls than most. But once you’ve worked out what they all do, it’s straightforward to use . All the locking knobs and levers are large and easy to operate, even when you’re wearing gloves, and they’re sufficiently well differentiated from each other in design that you shouldn’t find yourself unlocking the wrong movement by accident. Crucially they’re also all captive , so won’t fall out and get lost out in the middle of a field. With legs that are 3cm in diameter, the VEO 3+ 303CBS will support a sizeable load. I tested it using a Sony Alpha A7R IV and Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG DN OS lens together weighing approximately 2kg, which it handled with ease. Even in its most stable configuration, with the centre column down, it’ll reach 1.5m in height, which is handy when shooting outdoors in windy conditions. The ability to go considerably higher gives plenty of useful leeway for setting the camera to eye level even if you’re shooting on sloping ground. Inevitably, the trade-off is portability; you’ll need to be prepared to lug around a tripod that weighs over 2.5kg and is almost 80cm long when folded. That’s much the same weight as Manfrotto’s 055CXPRO4 , which is similar in height and also has a centre column that can be set horizontally (although not to intermediate angles). However, the Manfrotto folds rather shorter thanks to its 4-section legs, which I’d love to see Vanguard match with a future model. The VEO 3+ 303 range Vanguard also sells the VEO3+ 303 design in an aluminium version, and as a legs-only option without the head. The 303AT aluminium leg-set costs $299 / £299, while the 303ABS aluminium ball-head kit is $399 / £399. The carbon fibre legs on their own (303CT) cost $399 / £399, and finally, the BH-250S will set you back $149 / £139 separately.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: With a proven track record of exceptional image quality from the 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor, the X-S20 builds on this success by providing a camera that is both highly skilled for stills photography, as well as videography. If you already have the X-S10 and are primarily a stills photographer, then the X-S20 may be overkill for you, but for the budding or experienced videographer, vlogger, and live streamer, the X-S20 hits it out of the park, with a cracking set of video features that really takes it to the next level. You can start off in the Vlog mode, and work your way up to more advanced video needs, and you’ll find that the X-S20 continues to give you advanced video features including raw video output. For those that want a high-quality streaming camera, this is set-up and ready to go straight out of the box! The main question will be whether the price, and particularly the small electronic viewfinder, makes the X-T5 a better bet for stills photographers. If you’re a glasses wearer, and/or primarily like to shoot with an electronic viewfinder, then the somewhat small EVF on the X-S20 is perhaps the only negative I could find. For some this will be a deal-breaker, for others, it will be a non-issue, particularly if you’re a videographer and going to be using the screen only.

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Introduced with a new ultra-wide-angle XF 8mm f/3.5 lens , the 26.1MP Fujifilm X-S20 offers high-resolution video recording, at up to 6.2K at 30p, 4K at 60p, and FullHD at 240fps. Designed to be suitable for all types of users, whether that’s content creators, videographers, or stills shooters. The X-S20 is priced at: $1299 / £1249 body only, £1349 (with 15-45mm lens), £1599 (with 18-55mm lens), and available 29th June 2023. Fujifilm X-S20 Features – A wolf in sheep’s clothing… The X-S20 follows on from the Fujifilm X-S10 , and is Fujifilm’s mini-DSLR styled camera, designed to be easy to use, but feature packed, with in-body image stabilisation (IBIS), a top mode dial, and dual command wheels. This is in comparison to the X-T series, which feature more traditional shutter, ISO, and exposure compensation controls. The X-S20 sits above the X-T30 II , but below the X-T5, and with a larger grip it is suitable for a wide range of shooting, including using larger lenses, whilst maintaining a relatively compact size that makes it suitable for travel and video use. One area where the X-S20 misses out, compared to the X-T5, is in weather-sealing, as the X-S20 is not weather sealed. Introduced with a body-only RRP of £1249, this is a 25% price increase over the body-only RRP of the X-S10, which was £949/999 when introduced. The camera uses the same battery as the X-T4 / X-T5 (and X-H2/s) cameras, giving an improved battery life compared to the X-S10, this gives up to 800 shots with economy mode enabled, or 750 shots on normal mode. The 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor features a back-illuminated (BSI) design, and is joined by the X-Processor 5 for improved power efficiency. At first glance, the design looks very similar to the X-S10, but on closer inspection I found the grip to be ever so slightly larger, so slight, that you’d barely notice. The top shutter release button and surrounding on/off switch has been altered slightly and is slightly larger, with updated top buttons for ISO and Q buttons. The camera weighs in at 491g (with battery and memory card), and as expected, continues to offer five-axis in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) ,which is said to give up to 7.0 stops of image stabilisation. (Tested with the XF 35mm F1.4 R lens). This gives it an advantage over the X-T30 II, which lacks IBIS. AI based subject-detection auto-focus has been added, which Fujifilm say is equivalent to the X-T5. This detects a wide variety of options, including animals, birds, automobiles, motorcycles and bikes, airplanes and trains. It can also detect insects and drones! 6.2K/30p video is recorded at 4:2:2 10-bit, internally, and there’s a 3.5mm microphone / headphone jack on the side. An optional tripod grip, the Fujifilm TG-BT1, is available. Key Features at a glance: Improved battery life is just one of the new updates found in the X-S20, and the battery is charged in-camera using the provided USB Type-C cable, and AC power adapter (USB). Enhanced AI based subject detection auto-focus is available, as mentioned. This can be manually selected in the menus or will automatically detect the subject when the camera is in Auto mode. You’ll also find face and eye detection, as expected, however this is in a different menu, and does need to be manually selected, unless you’re using the Auto mode. Subject detection can be set to animals, birds, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, airplanes, trains, insects and drones. You’ll need to select birds for insects, and airplanes for drone detection. Phase detection focus works down to -7.0 EV* (with an XF 50mm F1.0 lens attached), or down to -4.0 EV* using contrast detection (using the same lens), according to Fujifilm’s own testing. All these other features come as standard with the X-S20 When I say standard, I mean, they’re they the same features you get with every new X-series camera, the incredibly popular Film Simulation modes , with 19 provided on the X-S20. These include Provia, Velvia, Astia, Classic Chrome, PRO Neg Hi, Pro Neg Std, Classic Neg, Nostalgic Neg, Eterna/Cinema, Eterna Bleach Bypass, Acros (+ Ye/R/G Filter), Black and White (+ Ye/R/G filter), and Sepia. There are options for film grain effect, as well as Colour Chrome Effect, and Colour Chrome Blue. Dynamic range options include DR100, 200 and 400, as well as HDR modes up to HDR800+. The HDR mode combines a number of shots to improve dynamic range, but results can look unrealistic at times. Using the in-body image stabilisation system dust can be removed from the sensor, using ultra-sonic vibration. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are built-in, and this works in combination with the new Fujifilm XApp . Video features at a glance: As the video features are significantly updated, it’s worth having a closer look at these here: The new Vlog mode is designed for recording yourself, as well as giving quick on-screen access to product priority focus, as well as a background defocus mode, face/eye detection, self-timer, IS mode, and high-speed
        mode. Fujifilm X-S20 Vlog mode quick access settings let you shoot face/eye detection, product priority mode, as well as background defocus mode. Photo Joshua Waller USB-Type C supports webcam use , without the need of additional software, and you can use film simulation modes while live streaming or in online meetings (should you wish). In addition to this 4K/60P resolution live streaming is supported , and works straight out of the box, with no need for a capture card or any additional software. A range of frame rates are available, including (29.97, 25.00, 24.00, 23.98 at 6.2K) and this can be recorded internally to SD card. The camera also records DCI-4K, 17:9, 4K 16:9, and FullHD (17:9/16:9) at resolutions from 23.98 up to 59.94p. High-speed video recording is available at FullHD (17:9/16:9) resolution at 100p, 120p, 200p, and 240p. An additional video resolution of 5.2K 16:9 is available if using HDMI raw output. FullHD video is recorded with no crop, or a 1.29x crop with high-speed FullHD. CINE / 4K video has a 1.18x crop (above 29.97fps), with no crop at 4K 29.97fps (8-bit only). 6.2K video has no crop. Switching on DIS, Digital Image Stabilisation adds a further 1.1x crop, when available (4K/FullHD only). Video recording time is said to be up to 95mins (FullHD, actual), or up to 150min (FullHD, continuous, with external power). There are four Custom settings on the mode dial (C1, C2, C3, and you guessed it, C4). These can be set to be either stills or movie, and then you can save custom settings for each of these, whether you want these to be setup for video or stills is up to you. On the back, there are two screw holes, plus a hidden (covered) connection, and this lets you connect the optional cooling fan that was introduced with the X-H2s. When recording a red tally surround / red frame indicator is shown on the screen, and there’s also an orange tally light on the rear of the camera, so the person behind the camera can see the recording status even when the screen is facing forwards. If the screen isn’t facing forwards, then a front tally light can also be switched on. These can all be switched on/off as needed. The new auto subject detection function detects a subject and tracks it with continuous AF. This works when shooting stills and video. Fujifilm X-S20 Handling The X-S20 features dual-command dials in the usual position, both front and back, making these easily reachable for adjusting settings. Unlike some Fujifilm cameras these don’t push in, and therefore can’t be clicked in to adjust additional settings. There’s a third command dial on the top left of the camera, and this is used for adjusting the Film Simulation mode on default settings (except in the Filter mode, where it is used to choose the different toy/effect filters) – this can be customised to your choosing. In fact almost every button can be customised (excluding the Drive, Playback, Menu and Disp. buttons), so that you can setup your camera exactly how you desire. You can use the Q (Quick) menu button to gain quick access to common settings, but most of the time this may not be needed, as there are a variety of external buttons and dials available. The menu system is logically laid out, but can take some time to master and navigate, simply due to the vast array of options and settings available. There is also the slight annoyance whereby an option will become greyed out, and no longer available for selection, but the camera will not explain why the option is greyed out. This is something I’ve seen on other cameras, whereby the camera will explain why an option is unavailable, so it’s a shame it’s not available here. There are also a vast number of options, and it might be time for someone to add the ability to search the menu system with an on-screen keyboard. In terms of build quality and construction the camera is, for the most part, made out of plastic. This fees very sturdy in almost all areas, with perhaps the only potential weakness found in the pop-up flash, which can bend slightly when open and squeezed. As the flash is unlikely to be used in this way, this is of very little concern. The rubber surround around the electronic viewfinder (EVF) is not particularly deep, and in comparison to the deeper eyecups on even budget DSLRs, this feels a little like a cost cutting. Luckily for those who wear glasses and want to use the EVF more regularly, there are optional eyecups available from third parties, as well as dioptre adjustment. However, the viewfinder does provide very accurate colours, and can be particularly useful to use when shooting in very bright sunny conditions. The 3inch screen features an increased resolution of 1.84m-dots when compared to the X-S10 . The  touch-screen can be tilted forwards, and adjusted to almost any angle you can think of. It provides a good view, with accurate colours, although there were times when it was difficult to see the screen clearly in very bright sunny conditions, and this
        can make it more difficult to judge the exposure accurately. There are options to increase the brightness in the menus, and this helps with visibility. Auto-focus The X-S20 features the AI based auto-focus system from the X-H2, X-H2s, X-T5 series, but with additional subject detection, this can be turned off if needed, but can detect a number of different subjects when in use. Using the AUTO mode enables a new auto subject detection AF and scene detection feature that is designed to automatically detect the subject as needed, automatically switching between people and animals, planes, trains and automobiles, and the other subjects the camera can detect. The camera will also automatically choose the best film simulation (seemingly randomly), as well as the best dynamic range settings. This means your photos can look wildly different from shot to shot, and whilst you can switch off the automatic film simulation, you can’t switch off the automatic dynamic range settings. The reason why this is worth mentioning is that in all the other modes, you still have to manually switch between either face detection OR subject detection , and then when you do select subject detection focus, you have to manually set the subject you’d like the camera to focus on. This is a real shame, as you never know when you’re suddenly going to see an animal appear, and this can result in you missing the shot. It would be amazing if you could simply set subject detection to automatic, in all camera modes, and not just the Auto mode. Apart from this slight complication in using the cameras new subject detection AF system, the auto-focus is generally very reliable, very quick, and for the most part does what you want it to, as long as you’ve got it on the right settings. If you don’t have it on the right settings, then you can miss shots, or miss the focus point.

The exposure system can be relied upon, and although tempting to adjust exposure compensation to adjust the look of an image, it is generally rarely needed. The only time when image colour and dynamic range was unpredictable was when the camera was set to Auto mode, as this switches on Auto Film Simulation, as well as auto dynamic range options, and this meant that shots could vary wildly from one to the next. Contrast is quite high on default settings, with the Film Simulation by default set to Provia/Standard. The levels of contrast can be adjusted by altering a variety of settings, including the Film Simulation, the dynamic range options, as well as the highlight and shadow tone curves. For a softer look, Astia is a great option, but for more people the default settings work really well. Auto white balance can be relied upon, giving great results time and time again. You can, of course, use any number of the preset white balance modes, but with auto white balance offering Auto, Auto white priority, and Auto ambience priority, it’s easy enough to quickly setup the camera to your own personal preferences. Low-light performance Even when shooting in dark conditions, the noise performance of the camera is impressive. Shooting at ISO640 gives very low levels of noise, as can be seen above. It’s not until you get to ISO3200 that you start seeing noise more clearly. However, we found that noise was very well managed, and isn’t an issue. The image below is a test of both low-light performance, as well as being a challenging shot to take due to the vast differences in bright and dark areas. This is the JPEG image straight from the camera with no further processing. As we go higher up the ISO range, noise does increase, as is to be expected. Using ISO12,800 gives an image with noticeable noise, particularly when viewing the image at 100%, however, we’d still be happy to use this ISO speed, as the results still look good. Higher than this and we might want to avoid using the images, but your needs may vary. Video quality Video quality is very impressive, with sharp detailed footage, as well as pleasing colours, accurate focus, and good exposure control. Image stabilisation is a little weak on default settings, using just IBIS and OIS (with the 18-55mm lens), and therefore we’d need to use the additional Digital Image Stabilisation (DIS), or a gimbal or tripod to get more steady footage. This also means that video footage can look quite wobbly when walking and talking to camera. When using the Vlogging mode , it appears as though you have to choose product priority focus before you start recording, which is frustrating if you wanted to switch
        back to face detection half way through the video. Wind noise can be an issue when using the built-in microphones, but this could easily be remedied with a ‘dead cat’ or an external microphone setup. The ability to plug the camera straight into a USB Type-C socket and for webcam use , is impressive. Particularly as you don’t need to install any software, and you can select resolutions up to 4K, with 60fps available. This will make this a perfect option for anyone who wants to live stream on Twitch or YouTube. Value for money To simplify alternative camera recommendations, we are looking at how much alternative cameras cost that offer in-body image stabilisation, as this is going to make a big difference to the quality and stability of video recorded when vlogging. Therefore, these are some of the closest alternatives we’ve found, including the Canon EOS R7 , Panasonic Lumix GH5 II , and OM System OM-5 . The Canon EOS R7 is priced at £1449 body only, which is noticeably more than the X-S20, but does offer weather-sealing. In terms of compact APS-C lenses suitable for vlogging, the Canon EOS R7 offers almost none. The Panasonic Lumix GH5 II is available for £1199 body only, and features IBIS, as well as a range of video features, but is quite a lot larger than the X-S20. The OM System OM-5 is priced at £1199 body only, for just a little bit more, the X-S20 is perhaps more feature packed in terms of video, and goes beyond the resolution for both stills and video, although the OM-5 does offer weather-sealing. The GH5 II and OM-5, as part of the Micro Four Thirds lens ecosystem, offers a vast range of lenses, compact, small, premium, take your pick. If you don’t need IBIS, for example, you’re going to be using the camera primarily on a tripod or other support, then this opens up your options further, so have a look at the best cameras for video . If you mainly want a camera for photography, then there’s the cheaper Fujifilm X-S10 , or the more expensive Fujifilm X-T5 to look at.'

      value: Canon's entry-level RF-mount model is designed as a simple, easy to use family camera. Andy Westlake takes a look at what it offers - and what it doesn't
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Canon EOS R100 is the entry-level model in the firm’s RF-mount range of mirrorless cameras. It’s designed to be a simple, easy-to-use family camera that’s compact and lightweight. We actually thought Canon had announced its entry-level model back in February, when the EOS R50 appeared with the same sensor and processor as the more expensive EOS R10 , but in a much simpler body derived from the older EOS M50 Mark II . Now Canon has figured out how to make a camera that’s cheaper still, at £670 with the 18-45mm kit zoom, compared to £900 for the EOS R50. Canon EOS R100 at a glance: So how has Canon achieved this feat of affordability? Essentially, it’s gone back in time and re-used the innards of the EOS M50 Mark II – which aren’t much different from the original EOS M50 from 2018. And it’s put these in a body design that strongly resembles the R50 but is even simpler, with a fixed rear screen. The result is a camera reminiscent of the firm’s older, very basic entry-level DSLRs such as the Canon EOS Rebel T7/ EOS 2000D . So what do you get – and what do you miss out on? Canon EOS R100 – features Firstly, while the sensor specs look much the same at first sight – a 24MP APS-C -sized unit – here you get a slightly slower top sensitivity of ISO 25,600 compared to ISO 32,000 on the R50. You also get the older Digic 8 processor, which essentially means that the R100’s core imaging components are now five years old. Let’s be clear, though, the EOS M50 / Mark II were still capable of giving very nice results, and we can expect much the same from the EOS R100. Just perhaps not quite as nice as the EOS R50. The older processor has one obvious drawback – it’s not beefy enough to run the sophisticated subject detection autofocus algorithms that are on all of Canon’s other recent cameras, which are capable of focusing specifically on people, animals or vehicles. Instead, the EOS R100 just makes do with f ace and eye detection . If you buy into the idea that this is a simple family camera that’ll mainly be used for taking pictures of people, that might not be a huge loss. Another penalty of the older sensor and processor comes with regards to video . Specifically, 4K recording is available at 25fps, but only using a substantial 1.6x crop of the sensor. This is a serious drawback when you take into account that Canon’s widest matched RF-S lenses offer only an 18mm wideangle view (equivalent to 29mm on full-frame). Once that crop is applied, this jumps to 46mm equivalent, which isn’t very wide at all. In fact, it’s extremely limiting. In 4K, you also don’t get Canon’s Dual Pixel AF, so are limited to the slower contrast detection, which is prone to producing disconcerting ‘wobbling’ during recording. This means that for decent video AF performance, you’re practically limited to using Full HD. As a result,  Canon is downplaying the EOS R100’s video features and has only fitted a fixed, rather than articulated LCD screen. If you consider yourself a ‘creator’, the message is that you should buy an EOS R50 instead. Canon EOS R100 – Design tweaks Looking at the top of the camera, there are some small but important differences compared to the EOS R50. Most notably, the R100 lacks an ISO button beside the shutter button, which feels odd for a camera that’s supposed to be tailored towards shooting still images. On a more positive note, you get Canon’s standard hot shoe that’ll accept a wide range of flashguns, as opposed to the EOS R50’s multi-function shoe that’s more suited to video sound-recording accessories, and which requires a £60 adapter to use a flash. Note that the EOS R100 appears to have only a mono microphone in front of the hot shoe. Another area where the EOS R100 differs from the R50 lies with regards to connectors. On the side of the handgrip, you get the same USB-C port for charging and connecting to a computer, and micro-HDMI for video output. There’s also a 3.5mm stereo mic input for higher quality sound. But the EOS R100 actually gains a feature here, with a 2.5mm wired remote release port. It feels like we’re getting slightly mixed messages, given the loss of the ISO button. Turning our attention to power and storage, here the EOS R100 uses Canon’s familiar LP-E17 battery, which is the same as the M50, M50 Mark II and R50. It also has a single SD card slot in the same compartment as the battery. This is a resolutely conventional approach for this kind of camera. Canon has made a point of including all of its interface features that are designed to help inexperienced users understand how to use the camera. You get a Guided UI, with descriptive cues for what the various controls do, complete with onscreen examples. There’s also Creative Assist, which provides a set results-driven adjustments (for example using terminology such as lighter/darker in place of exposure compensation). Canon EOS R100: First Impressions Canon has clearly brought the EOS R100 to market with the aim of it being one of the
        simplest, cheapest and most user-friendly mirrorless cameras available. Its £670 price tag with the 18-45mm kit zoom may look high to those used to sub-£500 DSLRs like the EOS 2000D, or the indeed the better-featured EOS M50 Mark II that’s £650 with its 15-45mm kit zoom. But it’s actually pretty affordable compared to cameras like the Fujifilm X-T30 II , Nikon Z50 and Sony Alpha A6100 . It’s also worth bearing in mind that Canon tends to launch entry-level cameras at prices that look rather high, but which come down over time. Unsurprisingly, my initial concerns about the Canon EOS R100 relate pretty much directly to the corners that have been cut to achieve its price point. Arguably the best EOS R50’s standout feature compared to its competitors is subject detection, but that’s missing here. Likewise, the R50’s saving grace in terms in terms of usability is its excellent touch interface, which you don’t get here. Instead, changing settings on a shot-by-shot basis will likely require a lot of tedious button-pressing. The EOS R100 just doesn’t look like it’ll be a very pleasant camera to use. That’s before we even start thinking about Canon’s disappointing RF-S lens range. The even bigger question, though, is whether anyone needs a small, light, simple family camera for taking pictures of special occasions without having to fuss around with complicated settings. Surely that’s what their smartphone does already…'

    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Canon EOS R50 is a 24MP entry-level mirrorless camera from Canon, using the Canon RF lens mount. It offer 4K video and high-speed shooting, as well as a compact size, but is it one of Canon’s best mirrorless cameras ? Find out in our full review. Canon EOS R50 at a glance: The Canon EOS R50 is an entry-level mirrorless model with a 24MP APS-C sensor. It’s aimed at those buying their first standalone camera having previously used a smartphone for photos and video. In many respects, it can be seen as a simplified version of the Canon EOS R10 , sharing the same sensor and processor, and offering a broadly similar specification. However, it’s even smaller and lighter , and has a much simpler, beginner-friendly design. If the EOS R50 looks vaguely familiar, that’s because it’s essentially a re-worked version of the EOS M50 Mark II , but with an RF mount, rather than EF-M. If you needed any confirmation that Canon’s older EOS M-series APS-C mirrorless system has reached the end of its life, this is it. The R50 is also effectively a successor to the EOS Rebel SL3 / EOS 250D ultra-compact DSLR, with Canon’s future now firmly set on the RF mount alone. Available in a choice of black or white finishes, the EOS R50 costs $679 / £789.99 body-only , $799 / £899.99 with the RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM zoom, or $1029 / £1049 in a dual-lens kit adding the RF-S 55-210mm F5-7.1 IS STM telezoom. This makes it rather more expensive at launch than either the EOS 250D or EOS M50 Mark II, which each cost around $699 / £699 with their respective kit zooms. In terms of the competition, it’s up against the likes of the Fujifilm X-T30 II , Nikon Z 50 , and Sony Alpha 6400 , all of which are similarly featured, if somewhat older designs. So how does the EOS R50 stack up against its competitors, and is it one of the best cameras under $1000 / £1000 you can buy? Canon EOS R50: Features Canon has built the EOS R50 around the same 24MP APS-C sensor as used by the EOS R10. This offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-32,000 , which is expandable to ISO 51,200. The camera employs a simple shutter mechanism that offers a choice of an electronic first curtain mode, with a fastest speed of 1/4000sec , or a silent, fully-electronic option which extends to 1/8000sec. In either case, the longest user-selectable speed is 30 seconds, with bulb mode also available. Despite its entry-level positioning, the EOS R50 boasts subject detection AF , which has previously only been seen on rather more expensive cameras. This means it can recognise and track focus specifically on certain subject types – people, animals and vehicles – which should count as a significant advantage over its competitors. It’s speedy for its class, too, being capable of shooting at 12fps , rising to 15fps with its electronic shutter. As we’d expect for an APS-C camera at this level, there’s no in-body image stabilisation. This means you have to rely on optical stabilisation instead, which is built into most (but not all) of Canon’s RF lenses. Likewise, you get a single card slot and a relatively small battery. Video can be recorded at 4K and 30fps with digital stabilisation, and unlike on the EOS M50 Mark II, this uses the full sensor width without a crop. Vertical video is supported for social media, and the camera can be used as a plug-and-play webcam. You get a built-in microphone socket for higher-quality sound, but no headphone socket to monitor audio. Smartphone connectivity is supplied by built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth , with Canon’s Camera Connect app providing a comprehensive set of options. You can use your phone either as a simple shutter release via Bluetooth, or as a comprehensive Wi-Fi remote control with a live view feed and the ability to change many camera settings. Then after shooting, you can browse through your images and copy your favourites for sharing. It’s also possible to geotag your images using your phone’s GPS data, and to auto transfer every image you shoot to your phone. In-camera raw conversion is available for tweaking your mages before sharing them, but only with Canon’s basic, results-oriented ‘Creative Assist’ interface. Canon EOS R50 key features: As its name implies, the EOS R50 is essentially an RF-mount reworking of the older EOS M50 design, with much the same layout. Canon EOS R50 compared to the Canon EOS R10 While the EOS R50 has a lot in common with the EOS R10 , it’s a much simpler camera, particularly in terms of control layout. The EOS R10 boasts a second control dial and Canon’s handy M-Fn button for changing secondary settings; a focus joystick and AF-ON button on the back; plus an AF/MF switch and DOF preview button on the front. It’s also more configurable, with two user customisable C positions on the mode dial. You get a fully featured hot shoe and a wired cable release port on the R10, too. In spec terms, the R10 offers quicker burst shooting (15fps with the mechanical shutter, and 23fps with the electronic)
        and can make use of the faster UHS-II SD cards to keep up. Its AF system is more sophisticated, with various AF use-case setups selectable in the menu for different shooting scenarios. This underlines the EOS R50’s positioning as a camera for beginners , with the EOS R10 aimed at more experienced photographers. Cann EOS R50: what lenses can you use? The EOS R50 directly accepts Canon’s RF-mount lenses , including both full-frame RF lenses and APS-C format RF-S optics. It can also be used with EF or EF-S DSLR lenses via the Canon Mount Adapter EF-EOS R ($99 / £119), or cheaper third-party alternatives from the likes of Viltrox. But Canon’s EF-M lenses for the older EOS M system can’t be used. Perhaps the biggest criticism of Canon’s RF system is the paucity of APS-C lenses. When the EOS R7 and R10 were launched last year, many observers assumed Canon would re-work its existing EF-M optics into RF mount, which would give a nice compact lens range for relatively little effort. But sadly, that hasn’t turned out to be the case, with the company instead releasing new designs that represent a step backwards from their EF-M counterparts. As a result, the EOS R50 is far less well-served in terms of lenses than either the EOS M50 Mark II or the EOS 250D that it supercedes. Nikon Z50 users are barely any better off, but both Sony and Fujifilm have much more extensive APS-C lens line-ups. The EOS R50’s standard kit lens is the RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM , which is relatively compact and lightweight to match the camera. However, its 29-72mm equivalent range and dim maximum aperture make it creatively limiting. There’s also a twin-lens kit that adds the RF-S 55-210mm F5-7.1 IS STM telephoto zoom (which equates to 90-335mm in full-frame terms). But without doubt the nicest companion to the EOS R50 is the RF-S 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM , an all-in-one zoom with a 29-240mm equivalent range. Unfortunately this costs $499 / £549, which is a big fraction of the camera’s price. If you’d like a native RF-mount wideangle zoom, that’s just too bad – at the time of writing, there isn’t one. Among the full-frame RF lens line-up, a few could be a nice match, including the RF 35mm F1.8 IS Macro STM , RF 50mm F1.8 STM , and perhaps the RF 100-400mm F5.6-8 IS USM . But most look too bulky and expensive for the EOS R50. Unfortunately, Canon has effectively blocked third-party makers from making RF-compatible lenses, so you can’t look to the likes of Tamron, Samyang or Sigma for alternatives, either. Canon EOS R50: Build and handling In terms of design, the EOS R50 borrows heavily from the EOS M50 Mark II, with a similar layout and control set. Canon is very good at making small bodies that handle well , and that’s exactly what we get here. The grip may be rather small, but it’s surprisingly comfortable in your hand, with a well-defined resting space for your thumb. Despite the body’s plastic shell and light weight, it doesn’t feel excessively cheap. The larger RF mount brings subtle changes in shape and styling, though, with more rounded shoulders and a curvier flash housing. The viewfinder eyepiece sticks further out the back, too. Where EOS M cameras used a control dial encircling the shutter button to change exposure settings, the R50 reverts to Canon’s standard vertically embedded dial, bringing the design language into line with the rest of the EOS R range. Physical controls are pretty minimal , with the back of the camera mostly taken up by the articulating screen. On the top, you get the shutter button, control dial, exposure mode dial, ISO and video record buttons, and the power switch. On the back, there are just exposure lock and AF area selection buttons; a 4-way d-pad with a central ‘SET’ button; and Menu, Info and Playback buttons. All these buttons are very small indeed, with the latter three also flush against the camera’s back, making them difficult to locate by touch when you’re using the viewfinder. The directional buttons on the d-pad are assigned to specific functions, with the up key used to set exposure compensation, and the left and right keys controlling AF/MF and drive modes respectively. You’re not allowed to reconfigure the d-pad to move the focus point directly, so have to press the AF Area button first, which is rather long-winded. Instead, it’s much easier to use the touchscreen to set the focus point, both when using the both rear screen and the viewfinder, but the latter has to be enabled in the menu. Other functions can be accessed quickly from the Quick Control screen by pressing the Q button. Canon has provided a good degree of customisability , certainly rather more than used to be the case on cameras at this level. The ISO, video record and d-pad buttons can all be reassigned to the user’s preference, and autofocus activation moved from the shutter button to the AEL button on the back. You can also customise the Quick Control menu, and build a My Menu to give quicker access to your most-used settings.
        This gives beginners plenty of growing space as they get to know the camera and its features. Given the relative lack of buttons, the touchscreen also becomes an important control point, with Canon’s excellent touch interface extending to every facet of the camera’s operation. It works especially well with the Q menu for changing multiple settings quickly. Overall, the EOS R50 is quite nice to use, as entry-level cameras go. But its lack of buttons and dials is likely to be frustrating for more advanced users, who really should be looking at the EOS R10 instead. Canon EOS R50: Viewfinder and screen There’s nothing much new about the EOS R50’s viewfinder, as it has much the same specifications as those on the EOS R10 and EOS M50 Mark II (and indeed, the original M50 before that). It’s a 2.36m-dot unit with 0.59x magnification , which means it’s distinctly small even in comparison to the R50’s entry-level peers. Then again, it’s still larger than the EOS 250D’s optical viewfinder. It’s also a bit dim , which can make it difficult to see in bright light. Canon previews colour processing and exposure across a +/-3 EV range, which gives a good idea of how your images are going to turn out. You can overlay useful shooting aids including gridlines, an electronic level, and a live histogram. Via the ‘Display simulation’ menu item, you can also get the camera to preview depth-of-field with native RF lenses, although this is of limited usefulness with the small-aperture kit zooms. But it could be genuinely valuable when using large-aperture primes. Also included is Canon’s ‘OVF sim view assist’ setting. This aims to replicate the experience of using a DSLR’s optical viewfinder, with neutral colours and boosted shadow detail. But on the EOS R50, it doesn’t have a great deal of effect compared to the larger, brighter EVFs on Canon’s higher-end cameras, so I didn’t find it as useful. The screen is the same 3in, 1.62m-dot fully articulated touchscreen that we’ve seen on other recent Canon cameras, including the EOS R10 and indeed the entry-level full-frame EOS R8 . This is no bad thing, as it’s decently bright, detailed, and colour accurate . With its side-hinged design, the screen is great for shooting at creative angles, be that waist- or ground-level or overhead. Unlike the screens on many of its rivals that only tilt in one dimension, it’s equally useful when shooting in portrait format. You can also position the screen so it faces forwards for self-recording, or fold it in against the camera’s back for protection. Canon EOS R50: Autofocus If there’s one area where cameras have advanced dramatically over the past few years, it’s with regards to autofocus , and specifically subject recognition . Having developed a highly sophisticated system for its flagship EOS R3 back in 2021, Canon has now trickled the technology down through the rest of its range, right to the EOS R50. Naturally given its low-end positioning, it doesn’t gain all the bells and whistles found on higher-end models. But it does get all the core essentials that make this such a useful feature, no matter what your skill level as a photographer. Thanks to Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF system, the EOS R50 can focus quickly and accurately anywhere within the image area . If you prefer to position the focus point manually, a wide variety of sizes are available, including three user-customisable rectangular areas. Alternatively, you can just leave the camera to decide on the focus point itself. This is where subject detection comes into its own. Like other recent Canon cameras, the EOS R50 is capable of recognising people , animals and vehicles , and then tracking and maintaining focus on them as they move around the frame. Unlike with some manufacturers’ systems, you don’t have to specify the subject type in advance, but can leave the system set to Auto detection. Alternatively, you can set the camera to focus specifically on the subject type you want. Once the camera detects a subject, it will outline it in blue, and then follow it as it moves around the scene. If the camera can’t recognise a suitable target, there’s also a conventional tracking mode that takes its cues from the colour and pattern of whatever you initially focus on. Just as with other recent Canon models, this all works exceptionally well, leaving you free to concentrate on framing the subject while the camera takes care of focusing. It’s impressive, and very welcome, to see such a capable and yet easy-to-use subject detection system at this price point. Without doubt, it’s the EOS R50’s biggest selling point over its rivals. Canon EOS R50: Performance As we expect from Canon, in use the EOS R50 is a slick and polished performer with no annoying quirks. It powers on near-instantly, and responds snappily to both the physical controls and the touchscreen. The shutter, while clearly audible, isn’t too intrusive, and you can switch to the electronic shutter in situations that require the camera
        to be silent. However, this does need to be used with caution, due to potential image-quality compromises from rolling shutter distortion and banding under artificial light. With the same sensor and processor as the EOS R10, the EOS R50 performs near-identically in most respects. Canon’s metering is, as usual, strongly linked to the focus point. This means your subject should never be badly under or overexposed, but you may need to apply exposure compensation if it should look much darker or lighter than average, or you’re in danger of losing highlight detail. This is relatively easy to see in the viewfinder. Auto white balance is usually well judged, which combined with Canon’s punchy colour rendition, means that JPEG files look really nice straight out of the camera. If you want to see the maximum amount of detail in your images, you’ll need to switch to the Fine Detail picture style, which uses more refined sharpening than the Standard option. Continuous shooting performance is really quite impressive, given the price. In my tests, the EOS R50 achieved its specified shooting speeds of 12fps with the mechanical shutter and 15fps with the electronic shutter. While the buffer is small – just 8 frames in RAW, and 17 in JPEG – it clears very quickly. This means you can shoot a lot of short bursts in rapid succession, as long as you use a fast SD card. While battery life is nothing to brag about, it’ll probably be just fine for many users. Canon has adopted a robust approach to power saving, with the viewfinder or LCD dimming and the refresh rate slowing dramatically after just a couple of seconds of inactivity. As a result, the promised 310-shot life isn’t wildly optimistic, especially if you regularly shoot bursts. Spare batteries are relatively affordable and easy to find, and the battery can also be topped up in-camera using a powerbank while you’re out and about. Just be aware that that It’s picky about needing a 3A USB-C supply, and unlike with many other cameras lower-power USB-A units won’t work. The 24MP sensor is capable of recording easily enough detail to make a sharp, detailed 16″ x 12″ / A3 print , even on close examination. If you shoot raw, you’ll find that there’s scope to lift up to three stops of additional shadow detail from the files at low ISOs. However, just as I observed with the EOS R10, if you go much further you’ll run into blotchy colour noise in darker tones that’s difficult to suppress. This is below par for modern sensors. Frankly, though, the biggest disappointment is the 18-45mm kit zoom . It’s reasonably compact in size, and sharp enough, but every time I used it, I found myself wishing it were that bit wider and longer. Indeed, anyone stepping up from a smartphone will be used to having a wider lens. Canon seems to think the EOS R50 should be a good choice for vlogging, but the lens really isn’t wide enough for that purpose. The f/4.5-6.3 maximum aperture is disappointing too, either for low-light shooting or trying to get any degree of background blur. Sadly, it’s pretty much the dictionary definition of creatively uninspiring. Turning our attention to video , here the EOS R50 benefits from all the same positives in terms of reliable metering and attractive colour output. But the big problem comes with stabilisation, if you wish to shoot hand-held. Electronic stabilisation is turned off by default, leaving you reliant on in-lens stabilisation alone. As this can’t correct for roll around the lens axis, you end up with footage that’s very jittery and pretty unwatchable. Enable the standard electronic stabilisation, and things look little better, at the expense of a 1.1x crop. There’s also an ‘enhanced’ option with a 1.4x crop, but then you get nothing resembling a wideangle view at all. For best results, you’ll really need to use a tripod or gimbal. Canon EOS R50: ISO and Noise With the same sensor as the EOS R10, the R50 gives much the same image quality . You get good-looking files at low ISO settings, with good levels of detail and barely any noise, even when viewed close-up onscreen. Noise starts to creep in at ISO 800, and by ISO 3200, fine detail gets noticeably degraded. At higher settings, image quality deteriorates progressively, with detail blurring away and shadows blocking up. I’d consider ISO 12,800 the limit of usability, at least using conventional (as opposed to AI-based) noise reduction. At ISO 25,600 both colour and detail deteriorate dramatically, while ISO 32,000 and ISO 51,200 are pretty horrible, and really best avoided. Below are 100% crops from our standard test scene, shot in raw and converted using Adobe Camera Raw at default settings. Click on any to see the full-size image.'

      value: The new OM SYSTEM OM-5 is the latest 20MP mirrorless camera from OM Digital Solutions - but does it do enough to impress Joshua Waller?
    - type: conclusion
      value: Whilst the saying goes ‘If it aint broke, don’t fix it’ the same could easily be said of the new OM-5. The camera looks almost identical to the E-M5 III, apart from the labelling, and you’d be forgiven for overlooking this camera if you’re already familiar with the E-M5 III. Whilst the OM-5 isn’t being marketed as a “ vlogging camera ” it would be quite easy to see how this camera could be an excellent choice for vloggers (and video makers, as long as the lack of a headphone socket isn’t too much of an issue). Especially as the camera has an impressive, if not the best, in-body image stabilisation, and the best range of lenses available. Of course, there are those that think “full-frame” is the be-all and end-all, but for people who value lightweight and travel rather than a sore back at the end of the day, then the OM-5 is worth its weight in gold. With an unmatched lens range, you really can have your cake and eat it.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The OM System OM-5 is the second new camera under OM Digital Solutions, the company formed after Olympus sold the imaging division. It’s one of the smaller mirrorless cameras available, and has a vast range of equally small Micro Four Thirds lenses available, but can it deliver quality images? Introduced in November 2022, the OM-5 sits neatly as a replacement for the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III , but with several updates that make it an even more appealing camera. Priced at $1199 / £1199 body only, the camera sits above the E-M10 range, and offers an IP53 weather-sealed camera body making it an ideal choice for those who want to travel light, and not worry about the weather. It’s worth remembering that the E-M5 has always been Olympus’ mid-range, lightweight, but high-speed weather-sealed camera, and this puts the new OM-5 up against the likes of the Canon EOS R7 (30fps, $1499 / £1350 body only, weather-sealed), Fujifilm X-T4 (30fps cropped, $1549 / £1549 body only, weather-sealed), and in some respects the Sony Alpha A6600 (11fps, £1399 / £1450 body only, weather-sealed). OM System OM-5 At a glance: OM System OM-5 Features The OM-5 uses the same 20MP sensor as the E-M5 Mark III, with phase-detection AF, and an ISO range of ISO 200 to 6400, which can be extended down to L64/100 (Low), and up to ISO 25,600. You’ll notice the OM-5 has a very similar camera body and control system as the E-M5 Mark III. However, the updates include improved weather-sealing, improved image stabilisation, as well as a number of features inherited from the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III / OM System OM-1 , including Starry Sky AF (for astrophotography ), built-in LiveND (up to ND16), and other video updates. How does the OM-5 compare vs the E-M5 Mark III: There’s more too, including custom AF target mode, MF assist, up to 4 custom modes (called by buttons), and MyMenu has been added.  There is now no video recording time limit, a red frame is shown during video recording, and support for a wireless remote control (RM-WR1) has been added. Autofocus uses on-sensor phase detection, with 121 AF points, and there’s improved face and eye detection AF, as well as up to 10fps continuous shooting with AF. However, the camera does not feature the same subject detection AF features as the E-M1X and OM-1. Starry Sky AF has been added, and is designed for autofocusing accurately on stars at night. You can use the OM-5 as a webcam, simply by using the USB cable provided in the box, without any need for software or a capture card. In-camera battery charging is also included, although there will be those sad to see that the USB port hasn’t been updated to USB-C, as it’s still a MicroUSB connection. ProCapture can shoot at 30fps using an electronic shutter. This isn’t new to this model, but is worth mentioning as it can give you the edge over cameras without this, and you can also shoot up to 10fps with continuous AF. High-speed shooting: Using ProCapture you can take up to 14 shots before pressing the shutter release button, however the fairly limited buffer when shooting at 30fps may be a limiting factor. Thankfully when shooting at 10fps, the buffer is much more capable. Fast shutter speeds are available, with up to 1/8000s using the mechanical shutter, or 1/32,000s using the electronic shutter. Video recording… Video has been updated to include OM-Log400, vertical video recording support, and a red record frame. The OM-5 can record unlimited 4K 30, 25, and 24fps at a resolution of 3840×2160 (UHD) at 102Mbps, or C4K at 237Mbps. High-speed video can be recorded at 120fps at Full HD resolution. You can also use the time-lapse shooting mode to create 4K videos in-camera. The movie mode has options for auto ISO speed (upper and lower limit) which can be used in manual movie mode, as well as timecode, to name just a selection of the options. OM System OM-5 Key Features 1 – Handheld Hi-Res – A handheld high-res mode can be used to give 50MP images automatically generated in-camera, or 80MP using a tripod (this was tripod only on the E-M5 III ) 2 – Built-in ND – LiveND lets you use a built-in (digital) ND filter for up to 4 stops, giving you an ND16 equivalent filter. 3 – Image stabilisation – In-body Image Stabilisation (IBIS) has been improved, with up to 7.5 stops when using a compatible Sync IS lens. 4 – Weather-sealing – The camera body now has an IP53 rating, the best in class, and you can register to extend the warranty to an impressive 5-years! 5 – Unlimited video recording – The camera can record unlimited 4K video, with support for vertical video, as well as a red record frame displayed on screen when recording OM System OM-5 Build and Handling The design of the body mirrors that of the E-M5 Mark III , with very little changed between the two apart from the labelling, with OM System emblazoned on the top triangle, which like it or not, is here to stay. The OM System OM-1 was the last camera to feature the Olympus branding. Handling for
        a smaller mirrorless camera is good, thanks to a large rear thumb grip, and a deep enough front grip. It’s a great balance between keeping the camera small, whilst also providing enough grip, however if you want a larger grip, then the OM-5 is compatible with the same optional grip from the E-M5 III. There are a number of external buttons, giving quick access to exposure compensation and ISO settings, plus a rear AEL/AFL button that can be used for back-button focus. The 4-way controller (with middle OK button) can be used to move the focus point (on default settings), but the lack of a joystick control is a little disappointing in today’s market. A super-control panel gives quick access to other settings, so that you can try and avoid going into the menus. Ah the menus…. The menus remain the old style of Olympus menus which can take some time to get used to, and unfortunately the OM-5 does not benefit from the new menus introduced on the OM-1. If you’re familiar with the Olympus menus, then you do (eventually) get used to them, but it can still take time to try and find where a feature is hiding. One big improvement made here though, is with the introduction of a MyMenu section which will give you quicker access to your favourite settings – this was sorely missing from the E-M5 III, especially as it featured on the E-M1x and following E-M1 III. The video options are all kept in a video section, so at least these are easy to find. You get side access to the memory card slot, which supports UHS-II cards, and there is a microphone socket, as well as remote socket and microHDMI. However there is no headphone socket (although you can use the LS-P5 audio recorder, which has Bluetooth headphone support). The camera uses the same BLS-50 battery as the E-M5 III , and this is also used in a variety of other cameras, including the E-M10 series, and PEN E-P7 . Spares are readily available, and highly recommended, as battery life is relatively short (but fairly typical for compact mirrorless cameras ) at 310 shots per charge. USB charging is now available, but not USB power, so in order to charge the camera you will need to switch it off. The battery compartment is lockable and features a rubber seal to keep moisture out. Viewfinder and screen: The electronic viewfinder (EVF) has a resolution of 2.36m dots , and a magnification of 0.69x, which is better than some others on the market ( Fujifilm X-S10 0.62x, Canon EOS R10 0.59x we’re looking at you), but not as good as others on the market (Fujifilm X-T4, X-T5 etc). However, considering the price, this is reasonable, and the electronic viewfinder gives a clear view with good colour reproduction that also matches the rear screen. There is dioptre adjustment for glasses wearers. You can also use the simulated “OVF” (S-OVF) setting to give a more neutral view, similar to the effect you’d get looking through an optical viewfinder. The screen is a 3inch, vari-angle, touchscreen, with 1037K dots , which is the same screen we saw on the E-M5 III. The screen is good, with accurate colour reproduction, and good viewing angles as well. However, it’s a shame this hasn’t been updated, as we’ve seen 1.62m dot screens on cheaper cameras such as the X-T30 II. With the screen tilted out, and away from the camera, the eye-sensor is automatically disabled, so that it doesn’t accidentally switch to the EVF. The touchscreen can be used to set the focus point (in stills and video), and can also operate the Super Control Panel, as well as scroll through photos in playback. However, it cannot be used in the main menus. Auto Focus Phase detection AF gives 121 cross-type points covering the majority of the frame, with customisable AF areas available, as well as a number of preset areas. Face and eye-detection, and subject tracking is available; however, the camera doesn’t inherit the more advanced subject detection AF from the E-M1x and OM-1. Focus is rapid, and performs well even in lower light conditions, and is very accurate, with face and eye detection AF working extremely well. Olympus were one of the first companies to introduce this with the E-M5 in 2012, so it’s no surprise that this works extremely well. It can make an extremely useful difference using this when shooting portraits, compared to a more traditional DSLR camera. Continuous AF tracking prioritises focusing accuracy rather than frame rate, so this can slow the continuous shooting speed down, however this can be adjusted if you’d prefer to prioritise shooting speed. Manual focus can be quickly selected using the rear switch, and with a central button, this can be used as a back-focus button on default settings. Manual focus has all the usual features and benefits that you come to expect on mirrorless cameras including focus peaking, magnified view (up to 14x), and focus assist. OM System OM-5 Performance and Image Quality Olympus cameras have consistently produced some of the nicest colour reproduction out there , and the
        OM System OM-5 is no different, producing images with beautiful colour straight out of the camera with great JPEG processing. This has a lot to do with the camera’s excellent auto white balance (AWB) performance, which is extremely reliable, and rarely needs altering. The camera gives you the option to “Keep warm colour” which gives the majority of images a pleasing tone, and if you instead want to take product shots with a white background, then simply switching this off means you’ll have one of the best cameras available for product shots . It’s relatively quick and easy to setup a custom white balance setting as well, and you’ll find a good number of useful presets including sunny, shade, and cloudy, amongst others. There are several colour modes available , including Vivid, or Natural, which are great starting points, and depending on your own personal preferences you can simply leave the camera on these settings, and get great results. You can also adjust a variety of settings including contrast, sharpness, saturation, gradation, plus highlight, midtone and shadow. Should you wish to adjust the look further, or you can shoot JPEG + raw and then adjust the raw files to your heart’s content. Beyond this, there are a vast number of Art Filters available, should you wish to apply a specific creative look. Dynamic range captured in JPEG images is good, and the camera does a good job of balancing between light and darker areas in images, with a reliable metering and exposure system helping here. For those used to the look of HDR images from smartphones, you can recreate this look using the camera’s built-in HDR mode that takes a number of shots and combines them (in-camera) to produce a JPEG image with increased dynamic range. The camera offers both a relatively normal looking HDR option (HDR1), and a more artistic and boosted looking HDR option (HDR2). Personally, I found the JPEG results to be perfectly cromulent, and would simply use the raw file to recover highlights on the rare occasion it needed extra dynamic range. The camera’s shutter sounds genuinely nice , it’s on the quiet side of the scale, but not too quiet, and has a more premium sound compared to the E-M10 III. Whilst this is of course subjective, there’s a definite air of quality that I associate with the “snick” sound of the OM-5 shutter, in comparison to the “clack” sound found on both the E-M10 III, and Sony A7 III. It is also quieter than the shutter sound on the Panasonic Lumix G9 . Handheld high-res mode lets you shoot 50MP images and is surprisingly effective considering how easy it is to use this feature. Once you’ve found the setting at the end of the list of drive modes, you can shoot handheld, with the camera combining 8 shots in-camera, and using the tiny differences between them to capture extra resolution. This gives you images with visibly improved detail. If you want even higher resolution images, then you can shoot up to 80MP when using the camera on a tripod . As with other camera’s high-res multi-shot modes, any movement in the scene could cause image artefacts. The OM-5 has a variety of photography centric capabilities , including LiveND , which lets you use the built-in electronic ND filter, with up to 4 stops, meaning you can shoot smooth waterfalls and rivers without having to carry any additional filters with you. On the Bulb (B) mode setting, you’ll also find the camera’s Live Time, Live Composite, and Live Bulb modes that let you see the exposure develop on the screen in real time, so you know when to end the exposure, without having to use guess work. If you shoot low-light, night photography , or long exposures, once you’ve used this, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. For astrophotography, the Starry Sky AF takes some of the pain out of focusing accurately on stars. Image stabilisation – The built-in in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) is especially useful for keeping the ISO speed low and capturing images where you wouldn’t normally without the stabilisation system. As long as your subject is suitable (and doesn’t move) this can be extremely useful. I was able to get sharp images when shooting in low-light, at 45mm (90mm equivalent), with a shutter speed as slow as 1 second. However, depending how steady you are, you might manage even longer than this. ISO and Noise When looking at the JPEG images from the camera on standard settings, the noise performance is generally good up to and including ISO 1600, and ISO 3200, with stronger noise appearing at ISO 6400. My own personal preferences mean that I’d be happy to use up to ISO 6400, but would try and avoid ISO 12,800, and particularly ISO 25,600. However, your own needs may differ. With such effective image stabilisation, it’s possible to keep the ISO speed lower. Video Recording Performance The camera has been updated (or warmed over) in terms of video recording, giving a number of useful updates including vertical video support, a red recording frame
        around the screen, and unlimited video recording, until your battery runs out, or your card fills up. I tested this, and recorded over 1 hour and 30+ minutes, non-stop, until the battery went flat , at 4K 24p, 102mbps video, with no issues whatsoever. Unlike other cameras, there were no issues with “overheating” and no need for additional cooling. Perhaps a benefit of the smaller sensor size offered by this camera? When recording 4K video (at 24fps, 102mbps), the camera can record continuously but splits the files into 5minutes and 20seconds each, with each file roughly 3.5-3.6GB in size. There’s also webcam support, but at a surprisingly low resolution of 720p. However, it’s likely that this will look much better than many laptop webcams which are still surprisingly (mostly) 720p and awful on most Windows laptops. For those that want to use the OM-5 for higher resolution webcam use, you’ll need to use the microHDMI out and a capture card. Image stabilisation during video recording is incredibly impressive , and OM System continue to offer some of the best image stabilisation of any camera system. This makes it possible to record video that looks far more professional than the usual wobbly hand-held footage, as the stabilisation system gives the impression of using a gimbal, particularly when using IS and Digital stabilisation. There are options to use IS + Digital, IS only, and the option to switch this off. There are a variety of video options including 4K (UHD) at 30/25/24fps, as well as CINE 4K at 24fps, however, the bitrate for these is fixed at 102mbps (4K), or 237mbps for CINE 4K. For some reason the camera only gives you bitrate options when recording Full HD video. It’s a mystery, as the menu gives the impression that you should be able to change this, but it’s greyed out, and only available for Full HD. High-speed Full HD video can be recorded at frame rates up to 120fps, however, this will disappoint those that want 240 or higher frame rates. The lack of a headphone socket will also be a disappointment to the more serious videographers, and in answer to this OM System does offer the LS-P5 audio recorder , which has Bluetooth headphone support. However, this won’t be suitable for all, and does add to the expense of the system (around $249 / £219). With built-in Bluetooth, why haven’t we seen any cameras with built-in Bluetooth headphone support? Value for Money If you look at the cameras available on the market, it’s clear there are a number of entry-level models that don’t feature in-body image stabilisation (IBIS), and for brevity, we’ll skip these, as these don’t feature weather-sealing either. But step up a level, and you can start looking at cameras in a similar price point as the OM-5, starting with the Fujifilm X-S10 , which slightly less than the OM-5 body only, and includes IBIS, but no weather sealing. The next option would be the Canon EOS R7 , which is $1399 / £1349 body only, and offers IBIS, and weather-sealing when using with a weather-sealed RF-mount lens. However, you’ll find that there are currently no weather-sealed APS-C lenses available for this camera, so to get this benefit you need to buy large, expensive full-frame lenses. Another option is the Fujifilm X-T5 , which is $1699 / £1699 body only, with IBIS, weather-sealing, and a good range of X-Mount lenses. However, it’s interesting to note that you’re having to look at a camera that is noticeably more than the OM System OM-5 before you’re finding something with similar levels of features. This makes the OM System OM-5 impressive value for money, at $1199 / £1199 body only, and the range of Micro Four Thirds lenses on offer makes it an even more appealing system.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: For owners of Canon’s entry-level DSLRs who already own a few EF and EF-S lenses, the EOS R10 could be a tempting option for a mirrorless upgrade. However, more advanced users should gravitate towards the EOS R7 instead. But photographers who aren’t already invested in the brand would probably be best served by the Fujifilm X-S10 , which is an equally engaging camera that’s backed up by an extensive range of lenses, all designed for APS-C. For those looking for a more affordable option, Canon also offer the entry-level Canon EOS R50 . What’s strange here is that Canon could boost the EOS R10 at a stroke by reworking its existing EF-M optics with the RF mount, just as it’s clearly done with the 18-150mm zoom. It would then have the basics covered and could boast of a much larger lens range than its arch-rival Nikon. The fact that it hasn’t gone down this route suggests that the firm is still struggling to admit to itself that its future logically lies with the RF mount alone. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait much longer for Canon to sort itself out and make the EOS R10 a viable choice for many more users.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'The Canon EOS R10 is a mid-range APS-C mirrorless camera. It should be attractive to both newcomers who’ve previously used a smartphone for their photography, and those currently using Canon’s APS-C DSLRs who are interested in stepping up to mirrorless . Does it deliver the goods, and how does the lens range stack up? Canon EOS R10 at a glance: In May 2022, Canon introduced two APS-C mirrorless cameras based on the RF lens mount, as previously used by its full-frame mirrorless models. The EOS R10 is the junior of the two, being smaller, lighter and less expensive than the Canon EOS R7 . In effect, it’s a mirrorless successor to the upper-entry-level EOS 850D DSLR , and a clear step above the firm’s popular EOS M50 Mark II , which uses the older EF-M mount. Looking at the pricing, the Canon EOS R7 costs $899/£900 body-only , $999/£1,000 with the basic RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM kit lens, or $1,279/£1,250 with the RF-S 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM zoom. This means it competes squarely with three other APS-C mirrorless models, the Fujifilm X-S10 , Nikon Z 50 , and Sony Alpha A6400 , all of which sell for around the same $1,000 / £1,000 mark with a kit zoom. All these cameras offer similar feature sets, although the Fujifilm X-S10 notably includes in-body image stabilisation, which the others lack. While it looks likely that the appearance of the EOS R7 and R10 marks the beginning of the end for Canon’s 10-year-old EOS M system , it’s just the start for the new APS-C RF line-up. This means that, aside from the three kit zoom lenses available, all the other RF lenses are designed for full-frame, which makes them larger, heavier and more expensive . As yet, there are no native APS-C RF-mount wide-angle lenses either, aside from the manual-focus Laowa 10mm f/4 . Thankfully you can use Canon’s EF-S DSLR lenses , or their third-party equivalents, via a mount adaptor. However, it’s important to note that there’s no way of using EF-M mount optics. Overall, lens availability is very much the EOS R10’s Achilles’ Heel. Canon EOS R10: Features Like the EOS 850D and EOS M50 Mark II before it, the EOS R10 is built around a 24.2MP sensor that provides a sensitivity range of ISO 100-32,000 , extendable to ISO 51,200. It also supports Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF for fast, accurate autofocus anywhere in the frame. With the latest DIGIC X processor on board, impressively the camera also gains the firm’s latest AI-based subject-detection AF system , borrowed from the high-end EOS R3 . This means it’s capable of specifically recognising humans, animals, and vehicles , tracking them as they move around the frame and homing in on ever finer details as they get closer – for example the body, face and then eyes. You even get use-case settings for tuning the focus tracking for different scenarios, which was previously the preserve of pro-level EOS DSLRs. This sophisticated autofocus system is backed up by impressive speed, with the EOS R10 capable of shooting at 15 frames per second using its mechanical shutter, complete with continuous AF. Switch to the silent electronic shutter and this increases to 23fps , although with a risk of rolling-shutter distortion when shooting fast-moving subjects, or banding under artificial lighting. The buffer isn’t huge, at 29 raw files at 15fps, or 21 at 23fps, but this is par for the course at this price point. If you’re happy to shoot JPEGs, the buffer increases dramatically to 70 shots at 23 fps, or 460 at 15fps, which is more than most users are ever likely to need. Files are recorded to a single card SD card slot , which can take full advantage of faster UHS-II type cards. Raw files can be recorded in Canon’s C-RAW format, which enables smaller file sizes with no perceptible loss of quality. There’s also the option to record high dynamic range images in the HEIF format , instead of JPEGs. This looks a nice idea in principle, but at the time of writing, HEIF doesn’t enjoy sufficient support to make it a truly viable option. As expected, both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are on board for connecting to your smartphone, via the free Canon Camera Connect app for Android or iOS. You can browse through your images on either the camera or phone, and then copy them across for sharing. It’s also possible to use your phone’s GPS to geo-tag your images while shooting. There’s both a simple Bluetooth remote release (which is surprisingly useful), and full remote control via Wi-Fi, complete with a live view display. This is all easy to set up and connect and works very well. Canon EOS R10: six key points Canon has made an SLR-shaped body that handles nicely given its compact size. Canon EOS R10: Build and Handling Superficially, Canon has styled the EOS R10 much like one of its small DSLRs. At 122.5 x 87.8 x 83.4mm and 429g , the body is compact and lightweight, to the extent that it’s smaller than the EOS 250D DSLR , and not dramatically larger than the EOS M50 Mark II. But the firm has incorporated a good-sized
        grip and plenty of external controls, which means it’s much more enthusiast-friendly than you might think, given its petite size. With its EOS R cameras, Canon has taken the opportunity to redesign the control layout to work better with the smaller mirrorless body and electronic viewfinder. Thankfully, the firm has learnt from its mistakes with its early models and not skimped on providing the controls enthusiasts expect. As a result, the EOS R10 now feels like a mature design with its own distinct identity. It’s a clear evolution, and improvement, over similar sized cameras Canon has made in the past. The handgrip is taller and deeper than usual for a camera this size, offering plenty to wrap your fingers around. As a result, I found the EOS R10 was comfortable to carry in one hand even with a sizeable lens on board. The body may be relatively lightweight, but it still feels reasonably solid and well-built. However, it doesn’t make any claim to be weather-sealed, so I’d avoid using it in heavy rain. For those who prefer back-button focusing, the AF On button is perfectly placed just to the left of your thumb’s resting position. By default, a half-press of the shutter button also activates AF, but you can disable this if you want to use the AF On button only. Alternatively, like most of the camera’s controls, you can reassign the AF-On button to another function. Unfortunately, though, you can’t configure AF-On to activate servo AF while also having the shutter button set for one-shot AF, which could be really handy. Canon’s M-Fn button is on hand for easily changing key shooting settings the camera held up to your eye, namely AF mode, white balance, ISO, drive mode, and flash exposure compensation. The latter three can also be set directly using the d-pad buttons on the back. In addition, the onscreen Q menu gives quick access to further settings, which can be changed using either the physical controls or the touchscreen. As usual with Canon, the touch interface is excellent, covering every aspect of the camera’s operation, including the entire menu system. Many of the controls, including the dials, buttons and Q menu, can be customised to suit your preferences. The video record button is placed prominently on the top plate, in a position where it’s easy to press for vloggers pointing the camera back towards themselves at arm’s length. Somewhat idiosyncratically, Canon has placed a lock button alongside it which disables some, but not all, of the controls. I found this a nuisance rather than a benefit and would have liked to be able to re-allocate it to something more useful instead, such as ISO. Despite these few quibbles, though, I found the EOS R10 to be a lovely little camera to shoot with, and every bit as enjoyable as the Fujifilm X-S10 or Nikon Z50. Existing Canon DSLR users should feel completely at home, after just a little familiarisation. However, there’s one major caveat, and that’s the viewfinder. Canon EOS R10: Viewfinder and screen One of the sacrifices made to achieve the EOS R10’s petite size is a tiny viewfinder, which provides 2.36m-dot resolution and 0.59x equivalent magnification . This is noticeably smaller than its direct competitors, which is disappointing for a £1,000 camera. It’s probably the weakest aspect of the whole design. Thankfully, the viewfinder does a good job of previewing how your images should turn out, in terms of both colour processing and exposure across a +/-3 EV range. This helps you to judge whether you might need to apply any exposure compensation to preserve highlight detail. Depth-of-field is previewed the old-fashioned way, by pressing a button on the front of the camera. Unlike on APS-C DSLRs, it’s a genuinely useful tool, as the viewfinder doesn’t go dark and the effect is clear to see. If you prefer, you can engage the opaquely named ‘ OVF sim. view assist ‘ mode, which provides neutral colour rendition and lifts shadows in a bid to mimic a DSLR optical finder. This can be particularly useful when you’re shooting in high-contrast bright sunlight, so I assigned it to a custom button (the down key on the d-pad). Below the viewfinder is a 3in, 1.04m-dot fully articulated touchscreen. Thanks to its side-hinged design, this can be set to almost any angle, including facing forwards for vlogging, or folded inwards against the body for protection. It’s also useful for high or low-angle shooting with the camera turned 90° to portrait format, which makes it more versatile than the tilt-only screens on the Nikon Z 50 and Sony A6400. As with the viewfinder, you can customise the information displays and cycle through them using the Info button. Options include gridlines, a dual-axis electronic level, and a useful RGB live histogram. Unlike some other cameras, you’re not forced to cycle through all these on separate displays but can combine them on a single screen if you like. It’s extremely well thought out and easy to use; it’s just a shame the viewfinder isn’t
        that bit bigger. Canon EOS R10: Autofocus Autofocus systems have progressed dramatically over the past few years, and the EOS R10 goes far beyond anything offered by either its DSLR or EOS M predecessors. Even when setting the AF area manually, some 4,503 points are available, arranged across all but the extreme edges of the frame. In comparison, the EOS 850D is limited to 45 points clustered in the centre of the frame. On some cameras, navigating through all these AF points would be slow and clunky, but Canon has got the response of the joystick just right, so you can traverse from one corner of the frame to the other rapidly and accurately. It’s also unusually easy to select between focus area sizes, by pressing the AF Point and M-Fn buttons in succession. Along with spot, 1-point and expanded area modes, Canon allows you to define three custom rectangular AF zones of almost any size you please. This can be useful when your subject will only appear in a specific area – for example, runners on a racetrack. Then there’s the AI subject detection system, which is lifted practically wholesale from the EOS R3. It’s capable of recognising humans (eyes, face, head or body), animals (including dogs, cats and birds) and vehicles (cars or motorbikes). Select between the three options in the Q Menu, and the camera will simply get on with outlining the requisite type of subject in the viewfinder and tracking it around the frame. This works impressively well, picking up subjects even when they’re very small, and progressively homing in onto the most important point. For wildlife shooters, the animal detection recognises birds and mammals without having to change settings, which makes it much less frustrating than Sony’s system. Switch to continuous AF, which Canon calls Servo, and the camera’s conventional tracking system also comes into play. This recognises any subject you focus on by shape, colour and pattern, and then tracks it if you recompose, or it moves around the frame. It’s impressively reliable, to the extent that some users might find it preferable to positioning the focus area manually. Unfortunately, with Canon unable to supply any RF-S telephoto zooms with the camera for review, I couldn’t test the AF system as fully as I’d like. Instead, I tested the camera with the RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM, along with the RF 35mm F1.8 IS STM Macro and RF 85mm F2 IS STM Macro . The latter two employ extending barrel designs, which never gives the quickest AF as a lot of glass has to be moved back and forth. But even so, they did a decent job of following subjects that moved in a fairly leisurely fashion. In general, the EOS R10 focuses quickly and decisively, in either one-shot or servo AF modes,  with the on-sensor hybrid AF being inherently accurate. Both the conventional tracking and subject detection modes work really well, allowing you to concentrate on composition rather  than having to adjust the focus point. One note of caution, though: I found that when the detected subject was distant and small within the frame, the camera had a distinct habit of focusing on the background instead. I also tested some old EF-mount DSLR lenses via a mount adapter, which focused just as well as they ever did on DSLRs, if not better. This could be a crucial factor for existing Canon users looking to migrate to mirrorless, as you won’t usually get the same performance if you adapt EF lenses to other camera brands Canon EOS R10: Performance In practical use, the EOS R10 turns out to be a snappy, responsive camera that consistently delivers fine images. It starts up almost the moment you flick the power switch, and then responds instantly to both the physical controls and the touchscreen. The shutter isn’t the quietest by any means, so bystanders will definitely be aware when you’re shooting. However, it’s not hugely intrusive, and you can switch to the silent electronic shutter if necessary. Battery life is nothing to write home about, but spares are easy to find, both from Canon and inexpensive third-party suppliers. It doesn’t take very long to top up using a powerbank, either. Canon has strongly linked the metering to the focus point, with the camera clearly aiming to ensure that whatever is underneath it will be well exposed. That’s not a terrible strategy, but it does mean that you’ll have to apply exposure compensation if the subject should be either lighter or darker than average. Luckily, the viewfinder makes this easy to judge accurately. The auto white balance system is very reliable, which makes for consistently good-looking JPEG files, thanks to Canon’s warm, punchy, attractive colour rendition. You won’t often be able to improve upon it during raw processing. This means that for scenes which don’t need significant tonal adjustments, out-of-camera JPEGs look just as good as processed raw files. In high contrast situations where you wish to avoid clipping highlight detail to pure white, you can engage Highlight
        Tone Priority mode. Using the standard D+ option, this preserves an extra stop of highlight detail while raising the minimum ISO to 200. Canon also recommends engaging this setting if you wish to use the HDR PQ shooting mode, which records in the HEIF format rather than JPEG. In principle, it then allows the additional dynamic range to be displayed in a perceptually natural fashion on HDR screens, and you can clearly see how this works in when playing back your images. However, I was unable to persuade any of my other devices to recognise the HEIF files properly. At the other end of the dynamic range scale, when shooting at low ISO settings it’s possible to boost shadow detail by about three stops before noise becomes problematic. Go much further, though, and you’ll see blotchy green and purple noise in dark areas that’s difficult to suppress. This performance is slightly sub-par these days: other APS-C sensors do better, including Fujifilm’s 26.2MP chip in the X-S10. Unfortunately, the RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM kit zoom is a real disappointment. It’s sharp enough, but the 29mm equivalent wide end is much narrower than the kit zooms sold with competing cameras, or indeed the main cameras in most smartphones. It’s restrictive for subjects such as landscapes or architecture, and really not wide enough for arms-length vlogging. This is compounded by the short telephoto end and dim maximum aperture. In terms of creative potential, it’s one of the most boring lenses I’ve ever used. I’d recommend the 18-150mm kit instead, despite its £250 premium. This is especially galling when you consider that Canon makes the wider EF-M 15-45mm f/3.5-6.3 IS STM for its EOS M system cameras, and it’s no larger or heavier. Nikon’s Z 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 VR also puts Canon to shame here, as it manages to be wider, brighter and smaller than the RF-S 18-45mm. Canon EOS R10: Video performance When it comes to video, the EOS R10 is capable of delivering good-looking footage, with decent levels of detail and all the same benefits of Canon’s fine white balance and colour rendition. However, with no in-body image stabilisation and digital IS disabled by default, hand-held footage is reliant on lens-based IS. But this can’t correct for roll around the lens axis, so the video looks jittery to the point of being almost unwatchable, especially if you’re panning. This means you really need to turn on Digital IS , which makes things look better at the cost of a 1.1x crop – this is the setting used in the short sample video above. The ‘ Enhanced ’  mode is even more effective, but with a 1.4x crop it gives visibly less detail and makes the kit zoom look even narrower, at 40-100mm equivalent. This might be OK for casual video clips, but for more serious shooting, you’ll need to use a tripod or gimbal. Canon EOS R10: ISO and Noise In terms of image quality, the EOS R10 gives much the same results as its 24MP Canon siblings, including the EOS M50 Mark II and EOS 850D. It delivers nice files at low ISO settings, with plenty of clean fine detail. When viewed close-up onscreen, noise starts to become visible at ISO 800, and by ISO 3200 it’s beginning to degrade fine detail noticeably. Beyond this, image quality deteriorates progressively, with detail blurring away and shadows blocking up. I’d still be happy shooting at up to ISO 12,800, but by ISO 25,600 both colour and detail have deteriorated dramatically, while ISO 51,200 is barely usable at all.

    - type: conclusion
      value: It’s tempting to compare the Canon EOS R3 to the Nikon Z 9 and Sony Alpha 1, and then dismiss it on the basis of its resolution. Why spend the best part of £6000 on a 24MP camera, when you could get double the pixel count elsewhere? But judging a camera, and particularly a specialist one, by its resolution alone is like judging a car purely by its top speed. What you really need is enough to get the job done, at which point other attributes become equally, if not more important. Which is a roundabout way of saying that, if 24MP is enough to get the job done, the Canon EOS R3 is an intoxicatingly brilliant camera to shoot with. It boasts one of the most sophisticated autofocus systems around, but makes it remarkably easy to use, allowing you to change settings quickly to suit the situation. There’s no doubting the value of eye control focus, especially now that it works together with subject detection. It’s a technology that I could never quite get to work properly on the 35mm film EOS 3, but with the EOS R3 it’s much more reliable, which makes it immeasurably more useful. It’s not just the autofocus system that’s impressive, either. This is a ludicrously fast camera that handles brilliantly and delivers excellent image quality, not only in raw, but also JPEG files direct from the camera. It’s something of a low-light demon too, giving perfectly usable results at very high ISO settings, while including excellent in-body stabilisation. As a result, it’ll nail the shot in conditions where other cameras would struggle. Of course, even for most enthusiast users the EOS R3 is overkill. You can buy the brilliant EOS R6 II for considerably less ($3513/£2799, and spend the money saved on some very nice lenses. But for Canon users who demand the ultimate speed and autofocus performance, it’s the camera to get.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Canon EOS R3 at a glance: The Canon EOS R3 was revealed as being ‘under development’ in April 2021. Five months later in September 2021 it was formally introduced into Canon’s ever-evolving EOS R lineup. Take up of the camera was initially so good, many photographers found it extremely difficult to get their hands on one. Today, the EOS R3 is readily available in most reputable camera stores and online, with like-new and excellent condition used examples fetching around $5934/£4729 and $5646/£4499 respectively. Hire prices for the EOS R3 typically start from around £150 per day excluding VAT. To recap, the EOS R3 is Canon’s super-fast, action-focused, professional full-frame mirrorless camera, but is it the best Canon mirrorless camera ever? Indeed, the firm says this is the fastest and most capable camera it’s ever made , being capable of shooting at 30 frames per second in full resolution 24MP raw. It can also record 6K raw video at 60 frames per second. But arguably its most exciting feature is a new twist on an old Canon technology, eye-control focus . This means the camera can detect what the user is looking at in the viewfinder, and then autofocus on it. This futuristic-sounding feature was found on several of the firm’s film SLRs in the 1990s, but the big difference lies in the way it now works in concert with subject recognition technology. With a body-only price of £5879 , the EOS R3 clearly isn’t aimed at the average enthusiast. If this is well out of your budget, but you still fancy a full-frame camera, have a look at some of the other best full-frame cameras available. As its price suggests, the EOS R3 is designed for professional sports and news photographers who demand speed and reliability along with rugged build and intuitive operation. At this price, it exists in the same rarefied space in the pro market as the Sony Alpha 1 and Nikon Z 9 . It’s perhaps less of an all-rounder than these other two big-hitters, but its remarkable speed and autofocus system make it an extremely impressive offering, nonetheless. Canon EOS R3: Features Canon has built the EOS R3 around an all-new 24.1MP full-frame stacked CMOS sensor , which offers a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-102,400 that’s expandable to ISO 50-204,800. The stacked architecture brings remarkable speed, including a world-record top shutter speed of 1/64,000sec , and the ability to combine flash with the silent electronic shutter at a sync speed of 1/180sec. The shutter lag is just 20ms , which is so short that Canon offers a menu option to lengthen it to match its DSLRs. That headline top shooting speed of 30fps is achieved using the electronic shutter, with a buffer of 150 14-bit raw files . Switch to the mechanical shutter and the speed drops to a still-impressive 12fps , but now with a vast 1000-shot raw buffer. Canon also claims that image distortion due to rolling shutter effects is almost completely eliminated, while flicker suppression is able to combat colour banding effects under LED lighting. Canon’s choice of 24MP resolution stands in contrast to the Sony Alpha 1 and Nikon Z 9, which employ 50MP and 45MP sensors respectively. But the firm believes this provides the ideal balance between image quality and file size for pro shooters who need to be able to transmit files back to their news desks as quickly as possible. Let’s not forget that the EOS R5 already offers 45MP at 20fps for those who want both speed and resolution. Autofocus is based on Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF II technology, where every sensor pixel is split in two to enable phase detection anywhere in the frame. No fewer than 4779 focus points are available, and the system is specified to operate in incredibly low light levels equating to -7.5EV with an f/1.2 lens. Canon has also updated its subject recognition system, so it’s now capable of recognising vehicles such as cars and motorbikes for motorsports photography, in addition to humans and animals. A detailed AF settings menu includes an array of Servo AF presets to deal with different scenarios, much like on the EOS-1D X Mark III pro sports DSLR. The really big news, though, is Canon’s re-introduction of Eye Control AF. This employs an array of infrared LEDs to determine where you’re looking in the viewfinder, which is indicated by a circular blue cursor. The camera then uses this information to select a subject for tracking when the shutter button is held half-pressed. The system must be calibrated to each individual photographer’s eye, but thankfully, this is a straightforward process. As is becoming increasingly standard, 5-axis in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) is built in. This works together with optically stabilised lenses to provide up to 8 stops of stabilisation, according to CIPA standard ratings. There’s no IBIS-based high-resolution multi-shot mode, but given the camera’s target audience, that’s no great surprise (or loss). Two card slots are provided for recording files: one accepts
        super-fast CFexpress type B media, while the other takes more affordable UHS-II SD cards. You can use them at the same time in backup mode, sequentially, or record different file types to each. It’s good that Canon doesn’t force you into only using expensive CFexpress cards, but the flipside is that if you want to use the two slots in backup mode, you’ll be limited by the speed of the SD. Power is provided by the same chunky LP-E19 battery as used by the EOS-1D X Mark III DSLR. It slots into the vertical grip and is rated for 860 shots using the LCD, or 620 with the EVF. This may sound low compared to a pro DSLR, but in reality, you can get many times more when shooting high-speed bursts using the electronic shutter. Pro-level connectivity is included for rapid file transfer, including 5GHz Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, and a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port. The EOS R3 is compatible with both Canon’s Camera Connect app, and a new Mobile File Transfer app for sending files to an FTP server via mobile networks, which could be an invaluable tool for news shooters. For this purpose, the camera is MFI certified to support wired connection to an iPhone. Canon EOS R3: Video features Video recording capabilities are just as impressive as for stills. The EOS R3 can record 6K raw at up to 60fps; DCI 4K at up to 60fps; and 4K UHD at up to 120fps. Canon promises up to 6 hours of video capture, raw video can be recorded internally, and both Canon Log 3 and PDR HQ are available for extended dynamic range. Conventional 3.5mm stereo microphone and headphone sockets are built in, but slightly disappointingly, the HDMI port isn’t full-size. Canon has also included a new multi-function hot shoe that allows wireless connection of a microphone, with the ability both to accept a digital audio input and to supply power to the connected device. This works with Canon’s DM-E1D directional stereo microphone (£399) and the Tascam CA-XLR2d-C adapter (£525) that enables connection of two XLR microphones. There’s also a remarkably small ST-E10 off-camera radio flash controller which costs £159, and an AD-E1 hot shoe adapter (£59) that’s required to maintain weather sealing with Canon’s existing Speedlites. Canon EOS R3: Key features Canon EOS R3: Build and Handling One area where the EOS R3 stands out is with regards to its handling. It has a similar design to the EOS-1D X Mark III pro DSLR, with an integrated vertical grip for portrait-format shooting. Being mirrorless, it’s rather smaller and lighter, although it still weighs in at over a kilogram. As usual with a pro camera, its body is covered with buttons and dials that give fingertip access to the most important settings, with the key shooting controls replicated across the two grips. In your hand, the weather-sealed magnesium alloy body provides the same kind of robust, bomb-proof feel as its DSLR cousin, while the distinctively textured rubberised coating offers excellent grip. However, Canon says it’s not quite built to 1D standards, which is why it gets the ‘R3’ moniker. Given that Nikon’s Z 9 offers top-spec build for less money, this feels like a slight let-down, but the EOS R3 is noticeably less heavy in return. In terms of control layout, the EOS R3 closely resembles the EOS-1D X Mark III. So you get Canon’s familiar electronic dials behind the shutter button and on the back for changing exposure settings, along with a joystick for setting the focus point, and a large AF-ON button beneath your thumb. But the R3 also benefits from Canon’s latest design thinking, including an extra control dial under your thumb that’s used to change the ISO. Like on the EOS R5 and EOS R6 II , this dial can be used to shift the ISO setting temporarily when Auto ISO is engaged, which can be really useful. With the EOS R3’s raison d’etre being its sophisticated autofocus system, unsurprisingly many of the buttons are given over to controlling it, eliminating any need to dive into menus. Press the AF area selection button on the shoulder, and you can cycle through AF area modes via the small M-Fn button beside the shutter release. A button on the front turns subject tracking on and off, while the Set button in the centre of the rear dial toggles eye control focus. As on the EOS-1D X Mark III, the AF-ON buttons double up as ‘smart controllers’, allowing you to move the focus area by dragging your thumb across their surface. It’s all extremely well thought-out and impressively quick to use, especially when compared to the Sony Alpha 1. Pretty much every physical control is customisable to suit your preferences, and you can also save up to three custom exposure modes for different shooting scenarios. Inexplicably, though, if you save camera settings to the C2 or C3 slots and then attempt to recall them, you’ll find they’re greyed out and inaccessible. It turns out you have to enable them separately in the menu, which makes no sense. As usual for Canon, the entire user interface, including the main menus,
        can also be operated quickly and easily using the touchscreen. Here the onscreen Q menu provides an alternative means of changing many of the major settings, without lots of button-pressing. Notably, this is the easiest way of switching the subject recognition system between people, animals and vehicles, or turning it off completely. Have a look inside the Canon EOS R3: On display at The Photography Show 2021, Canon showed the internal construction of the Canon EOS R3, and the tough looking magnesium alloy shell: Canon EOS R3: Viewfinder and screen The EOS R3 is equipped with a 5.76m-dot viewfinder that offers 0.76x magnification and a choice of 60fps or 120fps refresh rate. It also provides a blackout-free view in burst mode, with a flickering frame around the edge providing visual feedback during continuous shooting. You can overlay lots of useful additional information in the viewfinder display, including gridlines, levels, and an RGB histogram. Pressing the Info button cycles through display modes, allowing you to switch easily to a clean, uncluttered view. By default, Canon previews colour and exposure, but not depth-of-field; instead, this is done the old-fashioned way, by pressing a button on the front of the body. However, a full-time depth-of-field preview option is available in the menu if you prefer. There’s also an opaquely named ‘OVF sim. view assist’ option that aims to mimic the experience of using an optical viewfinder, which can be handy in high contrast conditions. Unfortunately, it can’t be toggled on and off using a function button. On the back you get a stunning 3.2in, 4.2m-dot fully articulated touchscreen, which can be set to face in almost any direction for shooting at awkward or unusual angles. It can also be turned inwards against the body for protection against splashes or scratches. It’s perhaps not as quick and easy to reposition as the Nikon Z 9’s 3-way tilting screen, but it’s vastly better than the Sony Alpha 1’s unit, which only tilts up and down. Canon EOS R3: Autofocus Once you’ve got the hang of how the EOS R3’s AF system works, it’s phenomenally capable. Naturally, it’ll focus on static subjects in an instant and with unerring accuracy. But the real magic happens when you start shooting moving subjects, where the combination of subject recognition and eye control gives an experience unlike any other camera. I got an impressively high proportion of in-focus ‘keepers’, and not just with high-end telezooms such as the RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM , but also with the relatively small and affordable RF 600mm F11 IS STM and RF 800mm F11 IS STM primes. For more options have a look at the Best Canon RF lenses for wildlife photography . You can choose practically any AF area size from a small spot to the entire frame, including three flexible zone settings where you can define the AF frame’s height and width. This is particularly useful if you know your subject will only appear within a defined area, such as a cars or runners on a racetrack. When there are multiple possible subjects, the ability to choose between them just by looking at one on the viewfinder is incredible. After a while, it becomes such an intuitive way of shooting that you almost forget it’s even happening. Canon’s subject recognition is likewise extremely impressive. It’s uncanny how the AF system can recognise the requisite type of subject instantly, and then track it as it moves around the frame. Even if you’re looking at an animal that’s distant and small in the frame, chances are the camera will pick out and focus specifically on its head or even eye. I was also impressed by how staggeringly well the AF system works in low light. In fact, it continues to recognise and track subjects in conditions where it’s almost too dark to even see, let alone take pictures. I watched mandarin ducks and a heron foraging in a shaded pond well after dusk, in light so low that it required ISO 51,200 at least, and the camera was still reliably tracking and focusing on their eyes. Naturally, the autofocus system isn’t perfect, either with regards to subject recognition or eye control. For example, it’ll pick up planes when set to detect animals, as they look quite like birds. And while eye control works brilliantly in many situations, I found it’s not so great with subjects such as birds in flight that move quickly and erratically, so you don’t know where to look in the viewfinder. In such cases, the conventional wide AF area settings tend to be a better choice. But this is where I really appreciated how easy Canon makes it to change settings quickly to suit different situations. Canon EOS R3: Performance With the EOS R3 essentially expected to take on the same kind of jobs as pro DSLRs, it’s got to perform to the same standard. In almost every respect, it achieves this; it starts up pretty much instantly when you flick the power switch, and then responds instantly to all the controls. It’s just as snappy when you’re using the
        touchscreen as the physical controls. However it does take a moment to wake up from its standby mode, so it’s worth getting into the habit of half-pressing the shutter button as you raise it to your eye. While the mechanical shutter is quiet and unobtrusive, the electronic shutter is completely silent. I couldn’t find any significant disadvantage with using the electronic shutter, either; there’s neither rolling shutter distortion, nor banding under artificial lighting. It seems Canon could have left out the mechanical shutter completely, like Nikon did with the Z 9. As the specs suggest, the EOS R3’s continuous shooting capability is impressive. In my tests, it matches Canon’s specified 30 frames per second for 150 frames in raw. However, if you switch to the cRAW format, which gives smaller files, the buffer practically doubles to about 300 frames. Drop the shooting speed to 15fps, and it’ll keep on going indefinitely (or at least, until your memory cards fill up). When it comes to battery life, everything comes down to how you use it. If you shoot the occasional single frame using the mechanical shutter, chances are you’ll get something close to the 620-shot CIPA rating. But if instead you fire off lots of high-speed bursts using the electronic shutter, you’ll get many times more than that. In my experience, getting 10,000 shots from a single charge isn’t out of the question. Just as with the EOS R5 and R6, Canon’s in-body image stabilisation works very well, especially in tandem with IS lenses. Using the RF 24-70mm F2.8L IS USM, I found it’s possible to get sharp shots hand-held with shutter speeds as slow as 1 second, and even longer if you’re prepared to tolerate a little pixel-level blur. At the other end of the scale, you can also hand-hold long telephotos confidently at slower shutter speeds than you might expect; I got perfectly usable images from the lightweight RF 600mm F11 IS STM at 1/50sec. Of course, with this camera you’ll often be trying to keep shutter speeds high to avoid unwanted motion blur. The EOS R3 is fully compatible with EF-mount SLR lenses via Canon’s Mount Adapter EF-EOS R. However, to get the most out of the camera, you’ll need to use Canon’s matched RF lenses. For more options have a look at the Best Canon RF mount lenses. In contrast, Sony E-mount users have access to a much wider range of lenses. When it comes to image quality, the EOS R3 barely puts a foot wrong. In typical Canon fashion, exposure and auto white balance are close to perfection, while the camera’s JPEG colour rendition is really attractive, too. This is important from a pro camera, as it means JPEG files can be sent to a news desk and used directly, with little need for any adjustments. Canon’s noise reduction is pretty effective as well, and I’d be quite happy shooting JPEGs at sensitivities as high as ISO 25,600. Shooting raw brings more flexibility of course, particularly in terms of dynamic range. Not so long ago, high-speed cameras often lagged behind in this respect, but the EOS R3’s low-ISO raw files are extremely malleable. At ISO 100 you can push shadows by at least four stops before noise becomes at all problematic (of course, there’s not a lot you can do about highlights that are clipped to pure white). This doesn’t necessarily persist at higher ISOs, though; instead you can run into blotchy low-frequency colour noise in dark tones that’s difficult to suppress. Adobe Camera Raw doesn’t do as good a job at suppressing high-ISO noise as Canon’s in-camera processing, although it is better at retaining detail. But you can get the best of both worlds using AI noise reduction software such as DxO PureRAW, which gives much better files in the ISO 6400-25,600 range, and perfectly passable results at ISO 51,200, maybe even a little higher. This just leaves the thorny topic of resolution. At 24MP, the EOS R3 lags behind the its similarly priced peers pro-focused, the Nikon Z 9 and Sony Alpha 1. With this type of camera, in practice this generally translates into a reduced ability to crop into files while retaining good levels detail, for example when photographing distant animals. On the other hand, it does make file handling much more manageable. Some users may well prefer Canon’s approach. Canon EOS R3: ISO and Noise While the EOS R3 may not offer as high a pixel count as some of its peers, it still delivers crisp, highly detailed files. There’s barely any visible noise or loss of detail at ISO 3200, and it’s only when you hike the sensitivity to ISO 12,800 that fine detail obviously starts to blur away. But I’d still be entirely happy shooting at ISO 25,600, while even ISO 51,200 isn’t out of the question when it’s necessary to get the shot. However, ISO 102,400 is decidedly ropey, and I’d avoid the extended ISO 204,800 setting, if at all possible.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: 'When Canon first revealed it had put the imaging guts of the EOS R6 Mark II into the EOS RP body, I had my reservations, even considering the lower price. After a couple of weeks shooting with the Canon EOS R8, those fears haven’t entirely been allayed. On the positive side, you get the same amazing autofocus system and excellent image quality as the EOS R6 Mark II, and that’s really impressive at this price. But you also get the same operational flaws and irritations as the EOS RP, which means that some will find it frustrating to use. Clearly, Canon has designed the EOS R8 so it treads on the EOS R6 Mark II’s toes as little as possible. As a result, you don’t get weather-sealing, in-body image stabilisation, or a second card slot, and you have to live with a small battery and much-simplified controls. I could live with most of that, although I’d be loath to spend so much on a camera without IBIS. But this does make the EOS R8 look decidedly under-specified for the price. However, perhaps the bigger irritation is that with the EOS R10, Canon has shown it can make a body that’s still simple, but much more pleasant to use. In contrast, the R8 seems to be designed for beginners. But it’s not clear why they’d pay so much for a full-frame camera. While the EOS R8 isn’t aimed at advanced users, if you’re willing to dive in and change a few menu settings, configure the C modes, set up a My Menu, and customise the Q menu, it can be made to work quite well. And to be fair, it’s much better than the EOS RP, thanks to its amazing autofocus. But at this price level, I’d take a fully featured high-end APS-C model instead, such as the wonderful Fujifilm X-T5 . However, here’s the thing with the EOS R8: you just can’t argue with the results. Quite simply, it delivers great images shot after shot. Rarely have I come across a camera that I’ve enjoyed using so little, and yet has impressed me so much with the pictures it produced. I’m sure many Canon users will be delighted with it.'
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Canon EOS R8 a glance: At the end of 2022, Canon introduced the EOS R6 Mark II , which we found to be a superb all-rounder for serious enthusiast photographers, with a 24.2MP full-frame sensor and advanced subject-detection autofocus. Now, the firm has taken the same sensor, image processor and AF system and placed them inside a smaller and simpler entry-level body based on the current EOS RP . The resulting camera, the Canon EOS R8 , doesn’t officially replace the RP, but instead sits above it in the firm’s line-up. Weighing in at just 461g – 24g lighter than the RP – the EOS R8 is Canon’s lightest full-frame mirrorless body yet. Like its predecessor, it’s also one of the most affordable full-frame cameras at launch, at $1499 / £1699 body-only. This places it in a similar price bracket to rather older models from other manufacturers, such as the Nikon Z 5 ($1349 / £1399) and Panasonic Lumix S5 ($1400 / £1400). However, the EOS R8 is rather different in concept to these veterans. It’s one of the few full-frame models to lack certain features that we’ve come to consider standard in enthusiast-focused cameras, including in-body image stabilisation and an AF-area joystick. It also makes do with an unusually small battery. Essentially, you’re getting an entry-level camera body with a full-frame sensor and a cutting-edge autofocus system inside. It’s a curious combination, but how does it stack up in practice? Canon EOS R8: Features While the EOS R8 borrows the EOS R6 Mark II’s sensor and processor, and many of the same systems, it’s important to understand that you’re really not getting a mini version of that camera. Instead, Canon has done as much as possible to differentiate the two, so that the R8 isn’t too tempting to enthusiasts who want to buy the higher-end model. The body design is much simpler, as are key internal components such as the shutter. No matter how close any side-by-side spec comparison may look, the two are very different beasts. Let’s take a tour through what the EOS R8 has to offer. Its 24MP full-frame sensor provides a standard sensitivity range of ISO 100-102,400 , which can be expanded by a stop in either direction at the expense of compromised highlight range at ISO 50, and excessive image noise at ISO 204,800. The shutter offers speeds from 40-1/4000sec using an electronic first curtain design, with no fully mechanical option available. The top speed can be extended as far as 1/16,000sec using the silent electronic shutter, but with the usual risk of subject distortion from rolling shutter effects. Autofocus employ’s Canon’s Dual-Pixel CMOS AF technology, which splits every sensor pixel into left- and right-facing segments, allowing phase detection anywhere in the frame. Impressively, the firm has included exactly the same sophisticated subject recognition system as in the EOS R6 Mark II. This can focus specifically on humans, animals, or vehicles , and you don’t necessarily have to define the subject type in advance, but can let the camera automatically choose between them instead. With vehicles, a ‘spot detection’ option refines the camera’s attention to the most important part. Burst shooting is available at 6 frames per second using the mechanical shutter, with the camera capable of sustaining this speed almost indefinitely. Switch to the electronic shutter, and the EOS R8 can attain an impressive 40fps for up to 100 CRAW images. There’s also a specialist ‘Raw Burst’ mode, which runs at 30fps and can continuously buffer up to 15 images before you fully press the shutter button. Canon’s CRAW format is worthy of mention at this point, as it exploits visually lossless compression to give considerably reduced file sizes. As a result, you can fit more files onto a card and shoot longer bursts before the camera slows down. It’s a relatively unsung feature that brings real practical benefits. Compared to the EOS R6 Mark II, though, you have to give up several desirable features. The camera uses the small LP-E17 battery, which is rated for just 220 shots per charge . Thankfully spares are easy to find, and relatively affordable at $60 / £54 (cheaper third-party options are also widely available). There’s also just a single SD card slot , but that’s only to be expected at this price, and has never really bothered me. Perhaps the most glaring omission is in-body image stabilisation, which means you have to rely on in-lens optical stabilisation instead. With telephoto lenses, that’s no disadvantage, but it isn’t as effective with wideangle lenses or when shooting video. Thankfully, most of Canon’s RF lenses are optically stabilised (although not all of them). Videographers can engage electronic stabilisation, too. On this note, you get 4K 60p recording from the full sensor width, or Full HD up to 180fps , with no hard limit to the recording time. This is a considerable advance over the EOS RP, which only recorded 4K video at 30fps with a 1.6x crop. Canon has also included its clever
        pre-recording function which can buffer either 3 or 5 seconds of video before the record button is depressed, so you shouldn’t miss unpredictable moments. Electronic stabilisation is available at two levels, but the ‘enhanced’ option comes with a significant crop of around 1.6x. Headphone and microphone sockets are built in, while Canon’s latest multi-function hot shoe accepts digital audio inputs from a select accessories. Canon’s usual comprehensive connectivity options are available via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth . Using the Camera Connect app, it’s possible to use your smartphone as either a simple wireless shutter release, or a comprehensive remote control with a live view display and full control over camera settings. Then you can browse through the images on your camera and copy your favourites across for sharing, even if the camera is switched off and tucked away in your bag. You can also use your phone to geotag your images as you’re shooting, and update the camera’s firmware without having to connect it to a computer. Canon EOS R8 – Key features Canon has re-used the EOS RP body design, but with significantly advanced technology inside Canon EOS R8: What lenses can you use? With this being Canon, we have to consider lenses. The EOS R8 can be used either with the firm’s RF mount lenses , or with EF-mount DSLR lenses via the Mount Adapter EF-EOS R ($100 / £119). This makes it a tempting option for existing Canon DSLR users looking to switch to a mirrorless camera. However, there are no third-party RF-mount lenses available, as Canon has apparently blocked their production. This stands in stark contrast to Sony’s decision to open up the E mount, which means there’s a huge range of lenses available to fit its A7-series cameras. Nikon is now also starting to open up its Z mount to third-party makers, while the L mount is supported by Leica, Panasonic and Sigma. To go with the EOS R8, Canon has produced a new compact, lightweight RF 24-50mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM kit zoom, which adds a $200 / £200 premium to the kit price. This lens features a collapsible design, optical image stabilisation, and a minimum focus distance of 0.3m. However, like similar zooms from Nikon and Sony, its limited focal-length range and slow maximum aperture mean that you end up losing most of the perceived benefits of the full-frame sensor. It’s cheap and convenient, but extremely limiting in creative terms. Canon does, however, make a range of relatively compact, lightweight and affordable RF lenses that should be a nice match to the lightweight EOS R8 body. These include the RF 24-105mm F4-7.1 IS STM standard zoom (which I’d choose ahead of the 24-50mm), RF 15-30mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM ultra-wide zoom, and the uniquely compact RF 100-400mm F5.6-8 IS USM telephoto zoom. These three zooms offer a combined range of 15-400mm, yet together with the EOS R8 they weigh less than 2kg, which is unprecedented for full-frame. Affordable primes include the RF 50mm F1.8 and RF 85mm F2 IS Macro STM . Canon EOS R8: Build and Handling When you first pick up the EOS R8, it really is striking just how light the body feels. It’s notably slim and low in profile , while being wide enough to incorporate a good-sized grip without cramping your hand up against the lens mount. Unsurprisingly, the exterior is entirely plastic, and Canon makes no specific claims regarding weather-sealing. Design-wise, the R8 is near-identical to the RP, however there’s now a still/movie mode selector on the top left. The power switch has moved across to the right, and along with the usual ON and OFF positions, it has a LOCK option that disables the control dials and / or the touchscreen. I’ve used Canon cameras with this feature for decades and am still not sure why you’d ever want to use it, but thankfully you can disable it in the menu. Controls are sparse, to say the least – this is distinctly an entry-level design. There’s just about enough on board to cover the basic camera settings, but not really anything else. As a result, if you want to use any of the EOS R8’s more advanced features, you’ll end up spending an unseemly amount of time in its menu. Existing Canon users should find the layout familiar enough, though. You get two control dials to change exposure settings, one each under your forefinger and thumb, and there’s an additional dial on many RF lenses. The d-pad on the back is used to position the AF area; this works OK, but it’s painfully slow compared to the EOS R6 Mark II’s joystick, as you can only move the focus area horizontally or vertically, and not diagonally. In the camera’s default setup, you also have to press the AF area selection button first, but I reconfigured this so the d-pad moved the focus point directly. You can also use the touchscreen to position the focus point, which is great when you’re composing using the screen, but won’t work for everyone for viewfinder shooting. Secondary settings are accessed via the M-Fn button , which is placed just behind
        the shutter release. Pressing it cycles through pairs of settings, which are then adjusted using the front and rear dials. Here you can change white balance and metering; drive and focus modes; flash exposure compensation and ISO; and picture style and AF area setting, all without taking the camera away from your eye. This works really well, it’s just a shame the M-Fn button is so tiny. Most of these settings can also  be accessed via the onscreen Q menu , along with useful additional options such as the subject detection mode and image aspect ratio. This works particularly well when you’re using the screen, as it’s quick to select and change settings by touch. Indeed, Canon’s excellent touch interface extends to every aspect of the camera’s operation, which also helps to offset the lack of buttons and dials. The Q menu can also be customised, which can give quick access to otherwise buried features such as the Silent Shutter or Raw Burst modes. All the controls are, in principle, customisable, which means you could assign your favourite functions to them directly. The problem is that all the buttons already do something useful, although in stills mode, it makes sense to repurpose the video record button. I resorted to building a custom My Menu of all the features I wanted to be able to access easily. Along with the conventional set of exposure modes, you also get Canon’s clever Flexible Program (Fv) mode. This effectively frees you from the constraints of thinking in terms of traditional modes – program, shutter priority, aperture priority, or manual – and lets you adjust the aperture, shutter speed, ISO and exposure compensation as you see fit, on a shot-by-shot basis. However, for this mode to work best, you need to assign a button to quickly reset each setting to Auto as required. Out of the box, this is done using the d-pad. But this is incompatible with moving the AF area directly, so I assigned the record button instead. One strange flaw with Fv mode is that when you use it to set the shutter speed, aperture and ISO all manually, the metering scale in the viewfinder becomes inactive, unlike when the camera is set to Manual mode. So far, so good, but once you try to do much else, the EOS R8 rapidly becomes frustrating, with many of the same irritations that I noted when I reviewed the EOS RP. For example, to engage magnified view for accurate manual focus, you have to press the AF area button, then Info to zoom in. This is easy enough when you’re using the screen, but awkward during viewfinder shooting. Unlike almost all of Canon’s other cameras, there’s no depth-of-field preview button, either. This is annoying as unlike DSLRs, mirrorless cameras can provide an entirely accurate preview in a useful fashion. For some people, the EOS R8’s simplicity will undoubtedly be a breath of fresh air. But personally, I wish Canon had used a body design more like the APS-C Canon EOS R10 , which is about half the price. It boasts an AF joystick on the back, plus a focus mode switch and depth-of-field preview button on the front. As a result, I found it much more pleasant to use. Canon EOS R8: Viewfinder and Screen Canon has re-used much the same viewfinder as in the EOS RP, with 2.36m-dot resolution and 0.7x magnification . It’s not quite as nice as the EOS R6 Mark II’s 3.69m-dot unit, but it still does its job perfectly well. You can display all the expected shooting aids, including gridlines, an electronic level, focus peaking, and a live histogram (in a choice of luminance or RGB). Canon previews exposure and colour processing by default, which gives a good idea of how your images will turn out and whether you need to apply any exposure compensation. If you want to preview depth-of-field, though, you’re out of luck – at least at first sight. The camera normally holds the aperture wide open all the time, and there’s no button for depth-of-field preview. You can assign it to one of the camera’s buttons, but only if you can find one you don’t need for something else. Help is at hand, though, in the shape of the obscurely named ‘ Display simulation ’ menu setting. If you change this to ‘ Exposure+DOF ’, the camera gives a full-time depth-of-field preview. I used this all the time, but the drawback is that in dim light, the viewfinder can get noisy, and its refresh rate slows right down. It also only works with native RF lenses, and not adapted EF optics. If you’d prefer the electronic viewfinder to give a neutral, unprocessed view that looks more like the optical viewfinder of a DSLR, this can be enabled via the ‘ OVF Sim View Assist ’ setting. This can be particularly useful in dark or high-contrast conditions, where dark areas of the scene may otherwise be difficult to make out. On other cameras, I like to set a function button to toggle it on and off, but unfortunately that’s not really an option on the EOS R8. Beneath the viewfinder is a 3in, 1.62m-dot fully articulated screen (a boost in resolution compared
        to the EOS RP’s 1.06m-dot display). Again, it’s accurately profiled in terms of colour, closely matching the EVF. The side-hinged fully articulated design allows the screen to be placed at almost any angle, which aids with shooting from high or low angles, and in either landscape or portrait orientation. Canon EOS R8: Autofocus With exactly the same subject recognition setup as on the EOS R6 Mark II, the EOS R8 boasts one of the most sophisticated and effective AF systems of any mirrorless camera, let alone at this price. Compared to the four-year-old EOS RP, it’s a vast upgrade. For photographers coming across from Canon DSLRs, it’ll be a barely fathomable step forwards, with its near-magical ability to understand what your subject is, and how best to maintain focus on it. Thanks to Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF sensor, the EOS R8 can autofocus rapidly and accurately anywhere in the frame . You get a choice of multiple focus area sizes, including three ‘flexible zones’ which allow you to define the width, height and position of the active AF area. This can be useful when you know your subject will be constrained within a particular area of the image – for example, performers on a stage. Alternatively, you can allow the camera to choose the focus point automatically across the entire frame. However, the camera’s real superpower lies with its subject detection AF , which will identify and track focus on specific types of object. Canon’s selection options are more intelligent than some other brands, in the way they allow you to narrow down the kinds of subject that the camera will focus on. In the Q Menu, you can select between People, Animals, Vehicles, Auto, or Off. This means that wildlife shooters, for example, don’t have to choose between animals, insects and birds – the camera can understand them all at the same time. The onscreen help also makes clear that the camera will still detect people when set to its animal or vehicle modes, because Canon realises that pets have owners and cars have drivers. This is much more user-friendly compared to Sony’s excessively picky selections, for example. There’s also a conventional subject tracking mode, which will stick to a subject based on colour and pattern and follow it as it moves around the frame. This is entirely independent of the subject detection setting and can function at the same time. It’s useful both for subject types that aren’t recognised, and when the recognition system fails. So if you enable a combination of servo AF, auto subject detection, and subject tracking, then you can pretty much just point the camera towards your subject, and allow it to acquire and maintain focus, either as the subject moves or you recompose your image. I tested the EOS R8’s autofocus primarily using the lightweight, affordable Canon RF 100-400mm F5.6-8 IS USM telephoto zoom which costs just $649 / £699. What impressed me most was just how high a hit-rate of in-focus shots I got, despite the lens’s small maximum aperture and consumer-level positioning. With large, predictably moving subjects such as vehicles, it got things right essentially all the time. Even with small, fast-moving wildlife, the camera usually tracked focused accurately, just as long as I was able to keep the subject in frame. During burst mode shooting, it occasionally shifted its attention onto the background instead, but not very often. For what is ostensibly an entry-level full-frame model, it’s an excellent performance. This tracking performance can, to a degree, offset having to use the d-pad to move the focus area; in many situations you can just start with a central AF point, and then focus and recompose. However, in scenes where you have multiple possible subjects and need to select one specifically, or in situations where you want to take several images without repeatedly recomposing, you do still have to specify the focus area manually. Canon EOS R8: Performance As we’ve come to expect from Canon, when you head out to take pictures with the EOS R8, you’ll find it to be a snappy performer that works extremely well . In my hands, it churned out sharp, well-exposed images shot after shot. Unlike some of its rivals, it delivers consistently attractive JPEGs straight out of the camera that I was perfectly happy to share directly, without any further tweaking. The camera is ready to take pictures almost the moment you flick the power switch, with no sign of the start-up delays that I found occasionally afflicted the EOS R6 Mark II. It’s not as quiet as its sibling, though, with the shutter emitting a distinctly audible clack. This isn’t  particularly obtrusive in normal use, but you wouldn’t want to use it during a church service. Continuous shooting performance is solid, but by no means spectacular. Using the electronic first curtain shutter and with a UHS-II SD card, I found the EOS R8 could fire off bursts at 6fps for at least 120 frames before slowing down when shooting in CRAW + JPEG, complete
        with AF tracking. If you’re happy to shoot in either CRAW or JPEG alone, it’ll keep on going indefinitely. Switch to the electronic shutter and it ups its game considerably further, with a choice of 40fps , 20fps or 5fps modes available. Strangely, though, the camera doesn’t display the actual frame rate you’ve chosen, and there’s no apparent option to shoot in the 10-12fps region, which I find is often a happy medium. At top speed, it’ll keep going for almost 2 seconds (77 frames in my tests), while continually adjusting focus. There is some risk of rolling shutter distortion with the electronic shutter, though, which is most likely to show up when panning. As expected from the specs, the battery life isn’t great , although for many users it may well be good enough. In practice, the exact number of shots you’ll get from a charge depends entirely on how you shoot. When shooting wildlife with plenty of long bursts, I once achieved well over 400 frames, but more usually got much closer to the rated 220. In general, I found myself recharging the battery after every shooting session. You can also top it up from a powerbank on the go, but like other Canon models, the EOS R8 is picky about requiring USB-C power supplies. An older USB-A output powerbank won’t work. Canon’s metering is generally very reliable, and the accurate viewfinder preview means that you can easily tell when you might wish to apply exposure compensation, for example to preserve highlights. As the metering is quite strongly linked to the AF point, this is more likely to be necessary if you focus on an unusually light or dark area of the scene. While you’ll get the most from the EOS R8 using native RF lenses, it also works flawlessly with EF-mount optics . I tried it with a range of lenses, including the classic Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro and my old Sigma 17-35mm f/2.8-4 EX DG HSM ultra-wide zoom. Both worked at least as well as they have on any DSLR – and probably better. With its 24MP sensor, the EOS R8 can capture easily enough detail to produce prints up to at least A3 (11.7 x 16.5”) in size that will look critically sharp when viewed up-close. Auto white balance is extremely well judged, to the extent that I rarely found myself adjusting it to any great extent when processing raw files (although occasionally, I chose to warm them up a touch). Canon’s colour processing is punchy and attractive, which means your images look great direct from the camera. Of course, many photographers prefer to shoot raw and process their images later, and here they’ll find that there’s plenty of dynamic range to play with, too. When shooting at ISO 100, you can expect to pull about four additional stops of detail out of shadow regions, which means you can expose to retain the highlights and then easily pull out detail in darker areas. However, if you go much further, you’ll encounter some pixel-level cross-hatching artefacts, which appears to be due to Canon applying noise reduction to raw files. Video quality is likewise very good, with high levels of detail and all the same benefits of Canon’s excellent white balance and colour. However, the lack of in-body stabilisation is telling if you shoot hand-held. If you attempt to rely on in-lens stabilisation alone, your footage will be spoiled by rolling motion around the lens axis, so it’s necessary to use some electronic stabilisation. However, I didn’t find the Standard mode particularly effective, while Enhanced comes with a significant crop. As a result, you’ll probably be best off using a tripod. As tends to be the case, the camera’s built-in mics deliver acceptable sound quality, but are easily overwhelmed when shooting outdoors in even mildly windy conditions. Canon EOS R8: ISO and Noise While the EOS R8’s 24MP sensor is a slight step back in pixel count from the EOS RP’s 26MP, in practice the difference is just 4% in linear resolution, which is trivial. Unsurprisingly, detail resolution is much the same as its 24MP rivals. The camera delivers very clean images at low ISOs, and extremely usable results a moderately high settings, too: I’d have absolutely no hesitation in using ISO 3200. Likewise high-ISO image quality is as good as we’d expect from a modern full-frame sensor. So while noise has an increasing impact on fine detail and colour, I’d still be quite happy shooting at ISO 25,600, and would even consider ISO 51,200 usable at a pinch. But the highest settings are best avoided. Below are 100% crops at each ISO setting from our standard studio scene, shot in raw and processed using Adobe Camera Raw.

      value: Tim Coleman reviews the Nikon Z30, a camera made specifically for vlogging and the cheapest Nikon mirrorless camera you can buy. But how good is it?
    - type: conclusion
      value: While all cameras can vlog, there is no doubt that a conscious effort has been made to design the Nikon Z30 with vlogging in mind. Superfluous features like a viewfinder are omitted, and the fruit is a streamlined camera at a price point appropriate for its beginner-level audience. The Z30 offers more to vloggers than its Nikon counterparts, the Nikon Z50 and Z fc, or even the best smartphones . Packaged with the impressive 16-50mm lens, it also represents a decent straight-out-the-box alternative to the Sony ZV-E10 . All-in-all the flip touch screen, wide-area continuous AF, tally lamp, generous handgrip and over-sized record button make for a pleasant self-shooting experience, while we like being able to charge the camera on the go and during recording. Regarding image quality, there’s little to choose between modern APS-C sensors these days, but it’s a sensor format with enough distinction from small sensor smartphones. In the Z30, outright image quality truly impresses, including its 4K video and flat colour profile. Where’s the rub? Well, without image stabilisation, run-and-gun self-shooters might need to dress the Z30 with a gimbal or bank on an uncertain arrival of a new ultra-wide-angle lens to give their shots room to breathe (or make do with the 16-50mm and no electronic stabilisation). A headphone jack is a glaring omission, too. It’s an uncomfortable feeling to shoot video without being able to audibly monitor sound. Otherwise, the Z30 holds a good account for itself. It handles well, has lovely image quality and a compelling price point.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Nikon Z30 at a glance The Nikon Z30 is Nikon’s cheapest mirrorless camera. It’s an APS-C model that joins the range just below the existing Nikon Z50 and Z fc , but while it shares a lot of the technology in these cameras, it has no viewfinder. The Z30 is aimed not so much at stills photographers, but vloggers, who will probably be more interested in the vari-angle rear screen. Whether it deserves to be considered amongst the best Nikon mirrorless cameras is a moot point because of its basic beginner-level features, but its ease of use and, especially its cost, make surely one of the best cameras for beginners , especially those looking for the best cameras for vlogging . If you’ve previously been tempted by Nikon’s other DX-format cameras but it’s mainly video that you’re interested in, this could be the camera for you! Cameras with a vlogging twist are nothing new, and the new Nikon Z30 steps into the beginner-level ring pitted against the likes of the Sony ZV-E10 and the Panasonic Lumix G100 . Let’s not forget that most vloggers don’t even bother buying a camera and use their smartphones instead. To that crowd, the Z30 promises better quality and creative versatility. This is also the third Nikon mirrorless camera with APS-C sensor, after the Nikon Z50 and Nikon Z fc. These three cameras utilise the same 20.9MP APS-C sensor and 4K 30p video recording capability. All are capable of vlogging, so just what makes the Z30 the vlogging camera? Well it’s not the vlogging accessory kit that is available, because this kit works just fine with the Z50 and Z fc too. No, we’re talking physical differences, so let’s unpack the Z30’s take on design and refresh on its performance and image quality capabilities. Nikon Z30 Features Most cameras these days shoot 4K video, but dig a little deeper and what’s on offer does vary. For example, the Z30’s 4K 30p and HD 120p slow motion video is taken from the full width of the sensor, meaning there is no crop. Most other competing cameras incur a crop in 4K video. A video without crop is especially handy for wide-angle shooters such as vloggers, who can use the full field of view of the lens. This is also helpful regarding the Z30 because the widest native lens DX in Nikon’s line-up so far has been the 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 VR kit lens which, although decent, is not ultra-wide, with its 24-75mm equivalent focal length. However, Nikon has since announced a Nikon Nikkor Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR wideangle zoom for this format, which helps to extend the somewhat thin Nikkor Z DX lens range and brings a PZ (Power Zoom) function that looks especially well suited to filmmaking. This was not available at the time of this review, which is carried out with the standard 16-50mm kit lens. At arm’s reach, the 16-50mm lens set to 16mm frames a self-shooter nicely. However, run-and-gun footage is shaky and if you add in-camera video stabilisation, which Nikon calls Electronic Vibration Reduction (E-VR), then a crop is introduced and the framing becomes a little tight. Sensor-shift in-body image stabilisation (IBIS) for video is more effective than E-VR and would not incur such a crop, but it is missing here. The kit lens does have optical stabilisation (‘Vibration Reduction’) but should not be confused with IBIS – it is designed for photos. That leaves run-and-gun vloggers ideally needing a gimbal or holding on to the hope of more Nikon Z APS-C lenses, especially the new ultra-wide-angle option. Yes, there is a sore lack of native APS-C lenses. There are almost as many cameras as there are lenses in Nikon’s APS-C mirrorless system, and that’s a worry. Still, Nikon has committed to a mirrorless future, and the 12-28mm DX wideangle zoom is a welcome addition. It’s not all about video. That APS-C CMOS sensor packs 20.9MP and an ISO 100-51,200 sensitivity, meaning it’s a sharp shooter for photographers in most conditions and promises that additional control over depth of field that a large sensor brings. In addition, the Z30 can be remotely controlled and images uploaded wirelessly through the Nikon Snapbridge app, while the USB-C port is the route for live streaming via the Nikon Webcam Utility software, for which you’ll need a computer. Good to know – key points Nikon Z30 Build and handling Every Nikon APS-C mirrorless cameras has the same sort of build quality, in that they feel solid in the hand but are not designed to be truly thrashed around. It’s beginner-level stuff. Where they differ is in design – three cameras and three flavours. First there was the mini-DSLR style Z50 which remains the largest of the three, with a pronounced grip. Then came the retro Nikon Z fc that painstakingly reimagined the legendary Nikon FM2. Both of these cameras have a built-in viewfinder. Now steps in the Z30 which has the most compact form factor and no viewfinder. A viewfinder certainly comes in handy for photographers, but is less relevant to vlogging because most video producers use a screen to
        compose the image instead. By not including a viewfinder, Nikon has been able to keep the size, weight and indeed cost down in the Z30. Kudos. While not as tall, the Z30 does have a particularly large and comfortable grip that provides a firm hold whatever position the camera is in. This is how camera grips are meant to be. Shooting photos at any angle, or turning the camera towards yourself to vlog, it’s a great grip. Nikon has made the top controls larger than normal. With the camera self-facing, there’s an easy search and find for the chunky video record button. It is also a sensible choice to split the two exposure control dials to front and rear. There’s more for the vlogging crowd, too. A new tally lamp on the front indicates to all around when the camera is recording. And unlike the Z50, the vari-angle touch screen flips out of the side for self-shooting. Video record times are not limited to 30 minutes in the way they are with the Z50 and Z fc, too. Nikon quotes around 120 minutes (or the battery or card limit). We also get built-in stereo microphones for enhanced in-camera audio that copes well in quiet spaces, plus a mic input to attach an optional external mic for better quality audio. Sadly, there is no headphone jack, so you won’t be able to monitor sound. Video producers shudder at the thought of bad audio and there’s simply no way of knowing how the video sounds on location other than using your actual ears. On-screen audio levels don’t paint the full picture. Nikon Z30 Viewfinder and screen As is obvious from the pictures, the Z30 does not have a viewfinder. Nor is there an optional electronic viewfinder that could slip into the hot shoe. This very fact makes the Z30 design more video-centric than the Z50 and Zfc. So, we rely solely on the 3in 1.04m-dot vari-angle touch screen. It boasts a bright display and flips out to the side without knocking the microphone port and offers touch focus functionality, playback and menu navigation. Combined with Nikon’s sticky wide-area people tracking AF, the screen works a treat for self-shooters. All-in-all, no complaints in this regard. Autofocus Autofocus is another like-for-like feature in Nikon’s APS-C mirrorless cameras. It’s the same 209-point phase/ contrast detection hybrid AF that promises a similar performance to the Nikon Z6 II and Z7 II. For vlogging – a genre that demands decent continuous autofocus – the wide-area with people tracking AF is the best bet, whereby autofocus is reliably sticky. For self-shooting, the camera switches to a selfie mode and tracked subjects are indicated clearly with red and yellow boxes. So not only is autofocus reliable, but solo shooters are given on-screen confidence. For regular photography of non-defined subjects, there’s a little more work on the user’s part in order to get the best results. Overall for photo and video, the Z30 autofocus is highly competent, though we prefer the performance and versatility of the Sony ZV-E10. Its dedicated ‘Product Showcase’ AF mode for vlogging comes to mind. Nikon Z30 Performance Battery life is measured at 330 shots which is a little modest, but it’s possible to squeeze out more pictures than that, depending how the camera is used. The camera is charged via USB-C with the cable provided, but you won’t find a dedicated charger in the box. Unlike the Z50, the Z30 can be charged via its USB-C port even while the camera is recording video or live streaming. Super handy. That same USB-C port provides a reliable connection to the Nikon Webcam Utility software for livestreaming. Likewise, the Nikon Snapbridge app which is used to remotely control the camera and upload images, has a straightforward and reliable connection from our experience with an Android phone. These days, hassle-free connectivity is bafflingly still not a given experience, so kudos to Nikon for making it a reality in the Z30. With regards to high-speed shooting, the ‘extended’ 11fps mode can capture up to 30 raw & JPEG pictures in a single go, all with continuous auto focus and auto exposure. The regular continuous high mode offers 5fps and a longer burst. For both modes, you’ll need patience to get shooting at full speed again. It’s what we expect from a beginner level camera in 2023. Nikon Z30 Image quality Those familiar with the image quality of the Z50 and Z fc already know what the Z30 is capable of. We have the same 20.9MP APS-C CMOS sensor with ISO 100-51,200 native sensitivity and 4K 30p video recording with no crops given. For photography and video, we have confidently used the Z30 up to ISO 6400, where the image remains sharp and clean, making the Z30 a versatile shooter. The adverse impact of noise muddying detail and compromised contrast is more evident in the ISO settings above ISO 6,400. Nikon offers a solid choice of colour profiles and sensibly separates photo and video colour profile selections. That way, when you switch between photo and video you don’t need to reselect your colour profile
        every time, plus there’s a ‘Same as photo settings’ option. The Standard colour profile is a safe starting point for photography, while ‘Flat’ suits video shooters in that it is the closest you get to a Log profile, maximising the Z30’s dynamic range. You’ll need to grade Flat footage afterwards to bring out the contrast and vibrancy to taste, but it’s an easier process than some regular Log profiles. One observation we have about white balance and colour rendition regards the impact of autofocus. The Z30 seems to prioritise subject detection AF for its colour rendition. Beginners may not notice the difference so readily, but it’s entirely possible to see green and magenta shifts within moments in the same scene depending on face detection AF kicking in. Additional video can be viewed on Youtube, by following these links: 4K standard profile , 4K flat profile , Electronic Vibration Reduction OFF , and Electronic Vibration Reduction ON . We’ve bemoaned the lack of native lenses, but the 16-50mm kit lens is admirably sharp and as a manufacturer if you are going to get one lens right for a beginner level camera, it had better be the lens that comes in the box! Other than its limited maximum aperture, the 16-50mm performs very well.'

    - type: conclusion
      value: The Canon EOS R7 out-specs all of Canon’s APS-C DSLRs, plus its older EOS M-series mirrorless models. It does this in a lightweight body that handles very nicely, despite its small size. With high-speed shooting, advanced AF tracking, and good battery life, it would make for a great all-round camera, as long as you don’t mind the lack of lens choices, or are happy with using full-frame lenses on the camera. The Canon EOS R7 does a great job of giving high-speed performance and generally high image quality. However, with the EOS R7, you’re left with the choice of just three APS-C lenses, in comparison to over 40 X-Mount lenses for the Fujifilm X system, over 22 E-Mount (APS-C) lenses for the Sony system, and over 100 Micro Four Thirds lenses for Micro Four Thirds cameras. If you’re a Canon EOS RF system user, who wants a slightly smaller camera body, high-speed shooting, and want to use full-frame lenses with a 1.6x crop, then the Canon EOS R7 could make for an excellent second camera body. If you’re coming to the system with no existing lenses, then you need to make sure you’re happy with the lenses on offer from Canon, as there really is a limited choice, unless you use full-frame lenses. The rear command wheel is another interesting choice, where a standard, normal command wheel would have done the job and been much less awkward to use. It didn’t take us too long to get used to the command wheel, but if there was a standard rear dial, we wouldn’t have had to get used to anything, and we’d be able to pick up the camera and start using it straight away. The joystick being in the centre of this dial is also another annoyance that could have been avoided. The screen looks great, but the electronic viewfinder (EVF) feels a little bit like an afterthought compared to the resolution and magnification on offer in other cameras such as the Fujifilm X-T3/X-T4/X-T5. It’s not a massive issue as the EVF still looks good, and gives accurate colour and exposure information. Image quality is very good, but for the best results you’re going to need to use a full-frame RF lens or EF lenses with an adapter, and it’s a real shame that the only RF-S lenses are zoom lenses designed to be compact, rather than designed for optimum image quality. Overall, in our time with the Canon EOS R7, the camera performed almost flawlessly, with great results possible, with the only issues being the lack of lens choice. Whether you’re looking for a camera for stills or video, the high-speed and high-quality output of the R7 certainly makes for an appealing camera, however, without additional lenses it could easily feel limiting.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'In a long-expected move, Canon introduced two new mirrorless cameras at the same time, the Canon EOS R7 and Canon EOS R10 , followed up more recently by the entry level Canon EOS R50 . All three employ the APS-C sensor format, but use the same RF lens mount at its full-frame models. This means they’re not part of the EOS M system that Canon has used for APS-C mirrorless until now, and can’t use EF-M lenses on these cameras. Canon EOS R7 at a glance: Of these three APS-C EOS R models, the EOS R7 is the most advanced, boasting a higher resolution 32.5MP sensor, faster shooting, a larger viewfinder and in-body image stabilisation. As the numbering suggests, Canon sees it as a successor to the EOS 7D Mark II APS-C DSLR, which means it’s one of the most ambitious APS-C mirrorless cameras yet made, going head-to-head with the likes of the Fujifilm X-T4 and Sony A6600 . The launch of the Fujifilm X-T5 , however, has raised the bar for APS-C sensor resolution with 40 megapixels, so the EOS R7 is no longer the highest resolution camera in this class. But still, it is one of the best Canon mirrorless cameras and, provided the RF-S lens range continues to grow, perhaps one of the best mirrorless cameras all round, at least for enthusiasts. With more lenses (or via adaptors) the R7 could also be one of the best cameras for action and sports photography . The EOS R7 is available for $1499 / £1449 body-only or $1899 / £1799 with RF-S 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM zoom, its usual ‘kit’ lens. . Canon EOS R7 Features Canon has built the EOS R7 around an updated version of the 32.5MP sensor from the EOS 90D DSLR and mirrorless EOS M6 Mark II . In concert with the Digic X processor, this offers a standard ISO range of 100-32,000 that’s extendable to ISO 51,200. The R7 can shoot at 15 frames per second using the mechanical shutter – half as fast again as the EOS 90D – or 30 fps using the silent electronic shutter. Autofocus employs Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF II, with each pixel split into two to enable on-sensor phase detection. There are 651/5915 selectable focus points covering the entire image area, which are claimed to work in extremely low light equating to -5EV. The EOS R7 also inherits the intelligent subject detection and tracking system from the flagship EOS R3, which is capable of recognising humans, animals or vehicles. High-speed shooting: Shutter speeds go as fast as 1/8000s using the mechanical shutter, and up to 1/16000s using the electronic shutter. Video recording In terms of video, 4K 30p recording is available that’s oversampled from 7K, in 4:2:0 8-bit or 4:2:2 10-bit colour (HDR PQ or C-LOG3) and with no 30-minute time limit. There’s also a 1.8x 4K crop mode that can go up to 60fps, Full HD recording at up to 120fps, and a 4K time-lapse option. Vertical recording is supported, for social media use. 4K Fine (IPB) is recorded at 120Mbps, or 170Mbps with C-Log or HDR PQ on, going up to 340Mbps (4K crop, 60p). People, animals and vehicle detection and tracking auto-focus is available while recording video. Microphone and headphone sockets are built-in, with Canon Log 3 also onboard for easier post-processing. A switch on top selects between stills and video modes, with separate settings retained for each. Canon has also used the same new hot shoe as on the EOS R3 , which includes a digital audio interface and can supply power to connected devices. Canon EOS R7 key features: Canon EOS R7 Build and Handling Canon has squeezed this rich feature set into a body that’s smaller and lighter than the EOS 850D DSLR, yet still boasts a large, comfortable handgrip and a good array of external controls. It employs two electronic dials for changing exposure settings, with the rear dial unusually placed around the focus area selection joystick. My initial impression is that this arrangement works well enough, although it’s not obviously better than the horizontal rear dial on other EOS R bodies. Canon has kept the top plate uncluttered, with the mode dial and power switch joined by movie, IS and Fn buttons; the latter gives quick access to a range of secondary settings. On the front, a switch around the depth-of-field preview button selects between auto and manual focus, which is handy given that many of Canon’s more affordable RF lenses lack AF/MF switches, including the new RF-S optics. For viewing, you get a 2.36m-dot electronic viewfinder and a 3in, 1.62m-dot vari-angle touchscreen. Power is provided by Canon’s familiar LP-E6N battery, which promises 500 shots per charge using the viewfinder, and 770 with the LCD. Canon is promising a similar level of weather sealing to the EOS 90D, but disappointingly, neither of the RF-S lenses are similarly protected. The menus and controls follow the same layout and design as Canon’s other cameras, and for anyone who’s used a recent Canon EOS camera the menus and buttons will be immediately recognisable, apart from the rear command dial / scroll wheel. This surrounds a joystick
        controller, and seems an unnecessary design flare that doesn’t add much to the user experience. It can take a while to get used to this rear command wheel / dial, and we’d have much prefered a standard rear dial, and perhaps a third wheel. Viewfinder and screen: The rear screen gives a clear and bright view of the scene and menus, although at slightly under 3inches, it isn’t the largest screen around. The resolution of 1.62m dots helps make up for this, and as you can turn and tilt the screen to your heart’s desire, it helps with viewing the screen even when shooting outdoors in bright sunlight, and of course if ideal for vlogging and selfies. The electronic viewfinder is acceptable, in that is does a good job of showing you what’s going on, but with a resolution of 2.36m dots and an average size (1.15x / 0.72x), it’s nothing particularly special, and disappointing when compared to higher resolution EVFs found on other cameras such as the Fujifilm X-T4/X-T5. Dioptre adjustment can be found on the left, and there’s an eye-detection sensor so that the camera will automatically switch between the rear screen and EVF when needed. You can toggle the view, and a dual-axis electronic level and histogram can be viewed on the screen (and EVF). You can customise what’s shown on screen in the menus, and the Info button will toggle through the displays. A variety of grids can be selected, with all the usual options such as the “rule of thirds”. There’s an optical viewfinder simulation mode designed to give you a natural view of the scene, without additional processing, so the opposite of “what you see if what you get” which has become the norm on mirrorless cameras. You also get the choice of a power saving mode, or a smoother display, with a faster refresh rate of 120fps. I found the standard, 60fps power saving mode, perfectly adequate. Native RF-S lenses Alongside the EOS R7 (and R10) Canon introduced two new RF-mount lenses designed for the APS-C format. Firstly, the RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM is a compact, collapsible design that offers a 29-72mm equivalent zoom range. It is sold in a kit with the EOS R10 or on its own for $299 / £320. Meanwhile the RF-S 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM costs around $499 / £520 and offers a 29-240mm equivalent range – this is the usual ‘kit’ lens for the EOS R7. Both lenses include optical stabilisation and stepper motors for autofocus. It has to be said that these lenses are the most disappointing part of Canon’s APS-C RF announcement. The 18-45mm may be small and light, but its focal-length range and aperture is uninspiring to say the least, especially as the firm offers an equally compact 15-45mm f/3.5-6.3 in EF-M mount. The 18-150mm looks like it should be a nice travel lens, and could make a fine match with the EOS R10. But like the 18-45mm, its 29mm equivalent wide end looks out of touch in a world where competing cameras come equipped with 24mm equivalent zooms, especially as there’s no RF-S ultrawide zoom. Since then, only one more native RF-S lens has arrived – the Canon RF-S 55-210mm f/5-7.1 IS STM telephoto zoom. It’s a shame that buying a high-speed, high-performance compact camera, one is immediately faced with having to use full-frame lenses in order to get a good choice of lenses. None of these lenses really comes close to matching the ambition of the EOS R7, so let’s hope Canon comes up with some more interesting RF-S offerings soon. For EOS R7 owners to really get the most from the camera, I’d like to see something along the lines of 15-50mm f/2.8 and 15-80mm f/4 zooms, with weather sealing and premium optics. It would also make sense for Canon to make RF-mount versions of its EF-M lenses, which could give it a shortcut to a nice APS-C line-up. If you’re coming from a Canon EOS DSLR, then you’ll find there’s a range of EF-RF mount adapters available, and EF lenses perform well on the camera, albeit without the size advantage of native RF mount lenses. Canon EOS R7 Autofocus The EOS R7 offers an impressive 5,915 AF points (manually selectable), with 100% coverage both vertically and horizontally, and 651 AF areas when on automatic selection. The camera offers human, animal or vehicle tracking, and you don’t need to specify what type of animal you’re shooting, with the camera automatically detecting dogs, cats and birds. Vehicles will detect cars or motorbikes, but doesn’t mention trains or planes. Human detection will automatically detect eyes, face, heads and bodies. Focus works in low-light down to -5EV, and an AF assist beam can be switched on/off if needed. The camera has a dedicated section for the auto-focus options, with multiple cases (4) as well as auto. The cases can be customised to your own preferences. You can use the touch-screen to touch and drag the AF point if needed, but this can be switched off in the menus. Manual focus peaking options can be customised letting you set the peaking colour. You can also shoot at up to 15fps with continuous AF using
        the mechanical shutter, or up to 30fps with the electronic shutter. Focus performance was particularly impressive when set to tracking, with the camera successfully tracking and focusing on subjects, including humans. Fast moving subjects rarely seemed to phase the camera with shot after shot correctly focused on the subject’s face. Canon EOS R7 Performance and Image Quality Dynamic range on default settings gives acceptable results, in most situations, but there are times when the camera can produce images with blown highlights in JPEGs, and it can be difficult to recover these even from the raw files. Once you switch to the HDR (multi-shot mode) or HEIF images, you suddenly realise how much dynamic range is missing from the image, and if you’re used to shooting with a smartphone where every image is taken in HDR you’ll quickly wish for more dynamic range. You can of course shoot in raw for additional dynamic range, or use the previously mentioned HDR or HEIF modes. The camera supports HEIF images, and to shoot these, you need to switch on the HDR PQ mode, which lets you shoot a HEIF file (and raw file if raw is switched on). In-camera you can then convert this to a JPEG image, with increased dynamic range over a standard JPEG image. However, it’s worth noting that there is very little support for HEIF (.HIF) files even with the latest version of Adobe Photoshop (v23.4.1). The shutter sound is relatively quiet, similar to other mirrorless systems I had to hand, and quieter than a full-frame Sony A7 III. Using the electronic shutter and silent option you can shoot completely silently, and this can be switched on/off in the menus. Metering generally performs very well, with the camera giving well exposed images, which tend to give a brighter image than other brands, as is the normal case when using Canon cameras. If you’re used to Canon cameras this will be perfectly normal, but if you’re used to other camera, you can easily alter this with a turn of exposure compensation, or by using Highlight Tone Priority settings. Auto white balance (AWB) is exceptional, with the camera producing extremely pleasing colours in a wide variety of shooting scenarios. If you wanted to be a little fussy, then you might find colours a little too neutral (rather than warm that many find pleasing) but again this is entirely subjective, and can easily be adjusted by tweaking the “Picture Style” settings. Auto White Balance also gives the option of ‘Ambience’ priority or ‘White priority’ which will be useful for white background product shots. In-body image stabilisation performed admirably, with the camera producing sharp photos time after time. On default settings the camera would increase the ISO speed rather than let the shutter speed drop too low, helping keep images sharp. ISO and Noise Noise performance is particularly well controlled considering the sensor is both smaller than most other APS-C cameras (with a 1.6x crop rather than 1.5x crop), as well as a higher resolution than most other APS-C sensors, meaning the Canon EOS R7 has some of the smallest pixels of any APS-C camera currently available, barring the Fujifilm X-T5. The camera gives good JPEG results up to ISO12800, and you don’t really need to worry about noise until you go above this, with ISO25600 and above being particularly noise filled. As you’d expect, using ISO32000 and ISO51200 is to be avoided. Video The amount of scene included in the video (the crop factor) depends on what resolution and frame rate options you go for. This also has a knock-on effect on the quality of the image, as only 4K 30fps uses a 7K image downsampled to 4K, and switching to a higher frame rate results in a cropped image. Focus performance during video recording is good, with the camera quickly and accurately focusing on the subject. * Canon EOS R7 4K Fine 25p Sample video with 18-150mm lens at 54mm, handheld panning, with IS+DIS switched on (standard, not enhanced), IS on (DIS off), and IS switched off. Editing the video files is a pain-free process with video recorded at roughly 120mbps (4K Fine, 25p, IPB). You can also save custom video modes to three different custom modes found on the mode dial. 4K Fine (IPB) is recorded at 120Mbps, or 170Mbps with C-Log or HDR PQ on, going up to 340Mbps (4K crop, 60p). People, animals and vehicle detection and tracking auto-focus is available while recording video. FullHD high-speed video can be recorded at speeds up to 120fps, so for those looking for 240fps video, you’ll need to look elsewhere. Value for money The Canon EOS R7 offers good value for money if you consider it on it’s own, without comparing it to other brands. For example, if you compare it to the cheaper Fujifilm X-T3 , you’ll find that the X-T3 offers a higher resolution electronic viewfinder, CINE video recording, although lacks IBIS (in-body image stabilisation). Another alternative is the Fujifilm X-T4 , which does offer IBIS. The Fujifilm X-S10 is also another very
        competitively priced option, but while it does have IBIS, it has no weather-sealing. The other benefit the Fujifilm X-System, Sony E-Mount, and Micro Four Thirds systems have going for them is the vast array of lenses available, in comparison to Canon’s three RF-S lenses. Of course, you can use RF (full-frame) lenses on the EOS R7, however, this defeats the purpose of using a smaller camera system. In comparison, with the Fujifilm X-system and Micro Four Thirds system all lenses have been designed to be the optimal size for the system. Compared to the Canon EOS 90D , the EOS R7 offers quicker continuous shooting 15/30fps vs 10fps, is smaller and lighter, with significantly more focus points, as well as more advanced focus, but can not match the 1300-shot battery life of the EOS 90D, with 770 shot battery life (LCD). In comparison to the Canon EOS 7D Mark II – which Canon sees the EOS R7 as a replacement for – the R7 again offers faster continuous shooting (15/30fps vs 10fps), a higher-resolution sensor, 4K video, built-in Wi-Fi, a touchscreen and tilting screen, as well as more advanced focus (5915 AF points vs 65). It’s clear that we’ve come a long way since the 7D Mark II was released in 2014!'

    - type: conclusion
      value: As mirrorless cameras go Nikon’s Z6 II is a solid all-round performer that still has a great deal to offer enthusiast photographers. From landscapes, portraits, documentary and social photography the Z6 II finds itself right at home. For sports and wildlife the Z6 II will do a competent job with its improved AF. All of the updates from the original Z6 are real and welcome improvements, but you do have to question whether there is enough new on the camera to represent two years’ worth of progress. It could be argued that with its first-generation models, Nikon hit the ground running compared to the standing start that Sony had some years previously. Perhaps with the Z6 being largely praised as a solid start on Nikon’s full-frame mirrorless journey, there was less that needed updating compared to some of the big leaps forward we have seen in the past. However, it’s also worth noting that the original Z6 is now some £400 cheaper than its successor. So there is a question worth asking as to the value of the new features for those thinking of buying into the Z system for the first time, especially given the firmware updates that have improved the Z6 since its launch. There is no question in my mind that the Nikon Z6 II is a better camera and priced fairly, but I don’t think there is enough improvement to warrant the vast majority of Z6 owners to upgrade. However with the Z7 II now having up to 10fps continuous shooting and the same dual cards slots and AF performance, it may be an upgrade option for Z6 users.
    - type: excerpt
      value: 'Nikon Z6 II at a glance: It has been nearly five years since Nikon launched its first full-frame mirrorless cameras, the Z6 and Z7 . The company was roundly praised for these two cameras, which featured many of the features that its DSLR users have come to expect. They placed Nikon firmly in the full-frame mirrorless battle, which with the introduction of cameras from Canon, Panasonic, Sigma and Leica, meant that Sony no longer had that part of the market all to itself. It wasn’t completely positive news, though, with much of the initial criticism aimed at the fact that the pair lacked dual card slots, which for many photographers is a dealbreaker if the camera is to be used professionally. The autofocus also lagged a little behind some of its competitors, most notably from Canon and Sony’s equivalent models. With the Nikon Z6 II, these two criticisms were addressed. The Z6 II launched alongside its 45.7MP Z7 II counterpart, and Nikon has released a series of firmware updates for the Z6II. The main tweaks in the most recent update were added support for the iOS edition of NX MobileAir, improvements to focus-ring response when MF is selected. It also fixed an issue which occurred when the camera was powered via USB that resulted in the supply of power ending after 15 hours of continuous use. Not so long ago Nikon would have named this new camera the Z6s, with it having very incremental new features over its predecessor. But Nikon caught up with the naming convention adopted by most other brands by adding a numerical designation, which should make it a lot easier to work out the generation of the camera (Fujifilm X100 S,T,F,V anyone?). Before getting stuck in to our Nikon Z6 II review, don’t forget to check out our guides to the best Nikon mirrorless cameras to buy and the best Nikon Z mount lenses Features With the same 24.5MP full-frame BSI-CMOS sensor, the same 3.2-inch tilting screen and the same 3.690m-dot EVF, most of the new features of the Nikon Z6 II are to be found in the camera’s menu rather than on its body. Indeed the only physical change that is immediately discoverable is the very welcome addition of an SD card slot. This overcomes the ‘only one card slot’ criticism, and also removes another mild annoyance, which was the exclusive use of XQD cards. With the CFexpress format being physically the same size as XQD, Nikon updated the firmware in the original Z cameras to use both formats, which should future proof the camera for the next few years and provide owners with more options. However, the addition of an SD socket means affordable cards are within reach for everyone. The biggest difference between the Z6 II and its predecessor comes with the addition of a second EXPEED 6 image processor. This may not read like a headline feature, but it is this system that powers everything that the camera has to do. So naturally, doubling the potential processing power has a knock-on effect on the performance of the camera. The effect of the new processing system, and tweaks to the algorithms that make everything work mean that the Nikon Z6 II boasts faster and more accurate AF, a faster shooting rate and better low-light performance compared to its predecessor. Those interested in the Z6 II for video will be pleased that it builds on the high specification found in the original Z6. Full HD 1080p video can be captured at up to 120fps, whilst 4K is recorded at 30fps. The 4K footage is downsampled from 6K footage, which should provide a great amount of detail. The video was improved in February 2021, with a firmware update which added a 4K 60fps mode. However it has a 1.5x crop, meaning you’ll have to use a shorter focal-length lens than you would normally to achieve the same field of view. It can also only be recorded at this frame rate internally. External recording via HDMI allows for 10-bit footage to be captured, and there is a paid update for the camera which will allow for 12-bit export so that footage can be recorded in ProRes Raw or Blackmagic Raw via an Atomos Ninja V recorder. Focal Points Build and Handling With its Z series body design, Nikon has created a mirrorless camera as close to its DSLR line as it possibly could.  Externally, little has changed on the mark II from the original Nikon Z6, and the new camera is just 2mm deeper to accommodate the extra card slot and/or processor (which may need slightly more space for heat dispersal). All the hallmarks of a Nikon DSLR are present; the power switch located around the shutter button, the angular prism jutting out from the top plate, the mode dial on the top left of the camera and let’s not forget the distinctive red flash around the handgrip. As a result, the Z6 II should feel familiar in-hand to Nikon users, while for those coming from other brands, the button layout is typical of a contemporary camera. Without wasting time and words describing the details in minutiae there are a few small features that are worth flagging. Firstly,
        the top LCD display. In my mind this is such a key feature of an enthusiast and pro DSLR that it’s great that Nikon have carried this over to the Z6 and Z7 range, as it helps distinguish these cameras from the Z5 and APS-C Z50, which sit lower down on the Nikon ladder. However, despite my delight having the option to use this top-plate display, I don’t actually recall a time when I so much as glanced at it, such is the benefit of having all of the information on the rear screen and the viewfinder anyway. Next up we have both the familiar directional control pad and a small joystick. Both provide quick ways to navigate menus and make it easy to shift the AF point around. However I found the quickest way to shift the AF point is to make use of the touchscreen. Finally, the grip. As someone who has owned a Nikon F50, F80, D70 and D300 you do become accustomed to type of camera grip and, for me at least, this is something that Nikon always gets right. The Z6 II is no exception with a large, high profile, rubberised grip that any Nikon DSLR user will feel right at home with. Another welcome carry-over from the firm’s high-end DSLRs are two function buttons on the front of the camera, which can easily be pressed whilst holding the camera up to your eye. All of the sockets on the side of the camera are hidden behind rubberised covers. These aren’t hinged but are self-retaining. It takes a firm push to put the rubber cover snuggly back into position, which offers reassurance as to the weatherproofing of the camera. Combined with the solid magnesium alloy body, this should provide photographers with the trust they need to shoot with the camera regardless of the conditions. From an operational perspective, there is little to write about. The well-managed menu system is the latest version of that which has been found in Nikon DSLR cameras for years. Everything is logically placed, with clear labels and some attempts at colour coding, which all make it easy to find what you need. Combine this with a customisable My Menu, the top LCD, and a Quick Menu which can be displayed whilst shooting, and you have all the tools you need to make quick changes to settings. Viewfinder and Screen I found the large 3.2-in 2.1m-dot tilting touchscreen to be very crisp and clear, with menu and text looking particularly crisp. Some users will certainly be pleased with the lack of full articulation, with ‘we don’t want to take photos or film ourselves’ and ‘having a screen tilting at the side isn’t as natural as having it centrally’ being the two most common refrains. With the off-centre location they have a point; a centrally located tilting screen, such as that on the Z6 II does make adjusting the composition a more natural experience. Nikon may have missed a trick by not including a fully articulated screen, particularly with the camera having some interesting video capabilities. The more purist photographers out there will be pleased to hear that the electronic viewfinder has a decent 0.8x magnification and a resolution of 3.69m-dots, which puts it ahead of the Sony A7 III, and on par with the Canon EOS R6. As with the rear screen, I found the EVF to be bright and clear, and I had no problem with any lag or capturing what I wanted. That said, it obviously lagged the finesse of the current top of the range EVF with almost twice the numerical resolution and refresh rates of up to 120Hz. Autofocus With two processors comes the increased power to calculate autofocus movements. For me, it is these AF improvements that warrant the most attention when considering the Z6 II, as I think it is where there was the most room for improvement from the original model. Like the Z6, the Z6 II has 273 phase detection AF points that cover around 90% of the frame – basically everything except the very edges. On paper little has changed in terms of specification, so it is with the increased processing power, and presumably the new AF algorithm (which is available as a firmware update for the Z6), where the improvements will come from. In single AF mode, the Z6 II is as fast and snappy as I would expect it to be. I didn’t find any issues using it and I would happily say that it matches the competition. One situation that is noticeably better is when shooting in low light. The Z6 II can AF at -4.5EV, which is a stop lower than the Z6. It can also now shoot as low as -6EV in a special Low Light setting. Nikon claims these figures based on single spot AF and using a lens with a maximum aperture of f/2. Without doing any stringent testing of this, what I did find was when shooting street scenes at night I didn’t experience any hunting that you would except to get whilst occasionally framing the odd image. It is worth noting that the quoted -6EV matches the current ‘low-light King’ the Sony A7S III, which with only a 12.1-million-pixel full frame sensor, has much larger photosites for gathering light. So hats off to Nikon for this feat. Other improvements
        come with the Face and Eye Detection modes. More processing power increases the speed of recognition of these, and there is also Animal Eye AF, which came as a later firmware update to the Z6 and Z7. These modes are easily accessible from the ‘I’ quick menu where they can be chosen as companions to the Wide AF mode. This is much better than having them tucked away in the main camera menus or having to dedicate a custom button to switch Eye AF on or off. I found that the Eye AF worked very well. It felt about as quick to detect and lock on to faces and eyes as the competitor cameras, such as the Sony A7 III. Of course, being able to draw a box on screen around an eye is very different from actually being able to focus on it, but again the Nikon Z6 II performed well when faced with the challenge of children running around, defaulting to Face detection where it couldn’t be sure of eye and getting the vast majority of shots perfectly sharp. So good is the eye detection that it even dealt with the challenge of focusing on the eye of my daughter whilst she was wearing a bright pink superhero mask, although it didn’t work 100% of the time. When the eye wasn’t detected the default face detection placed the focus probably around 1cm in front of the pupil, for a perfectly acceptable image. But to be able to shoot with a 50mm lens at f/1.4 and focus precisely on the eye of a superhero protecting her identity is impressive. Shooting in AF-C using subject tracking via the touchscreen worked smoothly. Just touch the screen to place the yellow square over the subject you want to track and away it goes. There were a few times I noticed the back-and-forth wobble where the camera had obviously switched to contrast detection AF, but again for moderately moving subjects I found continuous AF worked well for a camera that Nikon is calling ‘The All-Rounder’. If you are planning to shoot wildlife or maybe even sports, then it is the obvious choice in the Nikon Z system line-up. However, I still feel like there is more to come from this autofocus system. Nikon made firmware updates to the Z6 and Z7 II and I’m sure that with two processors there will be more to come from this AF system as more feedback is obtained from photographers. I also feel that there is room for a camera higher up in the range, along the lines of the Sony Alpha 9 II. Whilst the autofocus of the Z6 II is about on par with its peers, it still feels like there should be an elite level camera for wildlife and sports comparable to the Nikon D6. Performance During my time using the Z6 II, and previously the Z6, I was very much reminded of my beloved Nikon D300. The Z6 II feels very much like the mirrorless successor of the D300, albeit with a full-frame rather than an APS-C size sensor. What I loved 10 years ago about the D300 was its versatility; it didn’t necessarily excel at any one thing, but could easily turn its hand to whatever you could throw at it. Gven some tweaking of the exposure settings and some timing of when you pressed the shutter, you could always walk away with great images. The Z6 II is in a similar place now, with its 24.5MP sensor resolving enough detail for the vast majority of enthusiast photographers. Landscape photographers wanting to make large prints, or wildlife photographers wanting room to crop, may benefit from the higher resolution of the Z7 II with its 45.7MP sensor, but for everyone else the Z6 II will be fine. I found the dynamic range to be comfortably enough to shoot landscape images, and on par with its competitors. One thing to note is that I found the evaluative Matrix metering to compensate quite a lot for a bright sky. I ended up dialling-in 0.3EV compensation for some landscape shots, and even then I felt I could have raised it 0.3EV more without damaging all but the brightest specular highlights. This does also come down to personal preference, but is worth noting if you regularly use a priority shooting mode. At this point I’d like to take some time to praise Nikon to a fantastic feat of engineering with the Z6 II shutter mechanism. To produce a mechanical shutter that can shoot at 14fps, which matches the speed of the significantly larger Nikon D6 professional DSLR, is impressive. The sound produced by the shutter is nice and dampened, and there is an electronic shutter for completely silent shooting. It needs pointing out though that the 14fps continuous shooting rate does have its limitations; you can’t use 14-bit raw, presumably to do with the data throughput required, and you have to be in Single Point AF mode. For all the speed of shooting the AF obviously needs to be able to keep up the pace, which is where the dual processors come in. Shooting at the more conservative 12fps Continuous High mode I took a sequence of images of a Black Headed Gull coming in to land on water with mixed results. I’ll add a huge caveat that shooting birds in flight is a great skill, and one that I don’t pretend to be an expert in.
        Shooting in the Wide Area AF (L), which looks at a wider area than single point, I found that the first 4 images in the sequence tracking the gull in-focus, but then there was a jump to another gull in the frame. The second gull was the only other object in the frame, and the two gulls were separated by water in the image. I have no doubt that were I more skilled I would have had better results in a single AF spot mode, but my flaws aren’t the point of this tale. What I was impressed with was the speed at which the AF switched subjects. Within a single frame, the camera had told the 24-200mm f/4-6.3 lens to focus back on the gull in flight. It actually jumped between the two gulls another couple of times, within the sequence. The moral of the tale here isn’t that I still can’t shoot birds in-flight very well, it’s that the Nikon Z6 II does have the AF speed to be able to keep up with a bird in-flight, as well as my erratic handholding. Fine-tune the AF settings, use a better telephoto lens and put the Z6 II into the hands of an expert wildlife photographer, and I have no doubt that the AF will be up to the job. And as I said earlier, I still feel that there is more to be tweaked from this system as Nikon gets more feedback and refines it further. With twice the processing power the data produced by the camera can be shifted around more efficiently. This has seen the buffer increase from 35 12-bit raw shots with the Z6 to 124 with the Z6 II. This is of course reliant on being able to write to a fast enough memory card, with Nikon quoting these figures using a CFexpress card. However, given that they equate to holding the shutter button down for around 9 secs at the fastest shooting rate, the buffer should prove to be more than enough for enthusiast shooters using a UHS-II SD card rather than a faster CFexpress card. ISO and Noise As you would expect there is no visible luminance or chroma noise at ISO 50 or ISO 100, in fact images look very clean up to ISO 800.  At ISO 1600 that we start to see a hint of luminance noise and its reduction. By ISO 6400 the slight loss of detail caused by luminance noise reduction is visible, and this is the highest setting that I would feel comfortable using regularly. ISO 12,800 is certainly usable, but there is a loss of fine detail and some colour noise creeping in. The maximum native ISO 51,200 has that waxy look with detail lost, and where it is retained, patches of luminance noise are visible. The +1 and +2 extended settings should be avoided, particularly the latter; luminance noise and its reduction has decimated the image, and colour noise is still visible in some places.'

      value: 'What is the Canon EOS 200D? Bearing the distinction of the world’s lightest APS-C DSLR with a vari-angle screen, the Canon EOS 200D slots into the manufacturer’s range of DSLRs between the entry-level EOS 1300D and the more advanced EOS 760D and EOS 800D models. It’s a camera aimed at those looking to purchase their first DSLR as well as people who’d like to learn more about photography and develop their skills beyond the limitations of a camera phone or basic compact camera. It follows in the footsteps of the Canon EOS 100D in the way it has been designed as small as possible whilst being lightweight and convenient to carry on the go. The EOS 200D is petite in DSLR terms, but don’t let that fool you into thinking it’s lacking an impressive set of features. It boasts a good spec for its size and adopts a good number of features found throughout Canon’s DSLR range, including Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology, a vari-angle screen and Wi-Fi. Related: Best cameras Canon EOS 200D / SL2 – Features Canon has done away with the 18MP APS-C CMOS chip as used in the EOS 100D and has replaced the EOS 200D with a 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor. This sensor is identical to the one used inside the EOS 77D and EOS 800D, and works in tandem with Canon’s latest DIGIC 7 image processor. A quick peek at its spec reveals the new processor has improved the continuous shooting speed, albeit marginally to 5fps, which is 1fps faster than the EOS 100D. Just like the EOS 800D, the Canon EOS 200D offers an ISO range of 100-25,600, which can be expanded to a maximum of ISO 51,200 in its ‘H’ setting. It comes with an Auto ISO setting for those who’d prefer the camera to be the judge of the best sensitivity setting to use and the ceiling in this setting is ISO 25,600. It was only a matter of time before Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF system filtered down to EOS cameras at a lower price point, and at the time of writing the EOS 200D is the cheapest DSLR in Canon’s DSLR lineup to feature this technology. This sensor-based, phase-detection autofocus system not only introduces high-performance Servo AF tracking, but also rules out the lethargic autofocus performance in live view mode that’s associated with older Canon DSLRs lacking this breakthrough technology. Keeping on the subject of focusing, the Canon EOS 200D presents a fairly basic layout of nine AF points in a diamond formation, with one single cross type in the centre. This arrangement is identical to that of the EOS 100D and presents an AF working range of 0.5EV to 18EV. As well as offering the full manual shooting control you’d expect from a DSLR, the Canon EOS 200D offers good options for any newcomer to photography in the shape of a Scene Intelligent Auto mode, a selection of Creative Filters, as well as 11 scene modes. All of these beginner-friendly modes are easy to access directly from the mode dial. Turning to metering and exposure, this is looked after by a 63-zone dual-layer metering sensor. Exposure can be refined using the exposure-compensation system, which offers 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop increment adjustment over a +/-5EV range. The shutter speed range spans from 30sec-1/4000sec and, as with most of Canon’s entry-level DSLRs, you only get a single scroll dial on the top plate. Those wishing the make quick adjustments on the fly will appreciate the impressive 3-inch, 1040k-dot vari-angle touchscreen at the rear. Above the screen you get an optical viewfinder. Although coverage isn’t a full 100%, at 95% it’s respectable for a camera aimed at beginners, and benefits from dioptre correction and depth of field preview. There’s also a built-in flash that has a guide number of 9.8 (ISO 100), and a flash recycle time of 3 seconds. Naturally, those who require a bit more power can always attach a Canon’s EX series Speedlite or trigger wireless flash via the hot shoe. One feature lacking on the EOS 100D that the EOS 200D now boasts is built-in Wi-Fi. For anyone looking to step up from a smartphone this is, of course, seen as a must-have feature. It ties in with the free-to-download Canon Connect app and allows you to share images between mobile devices in seconds, as well as take control of the camera’s key settings when you’d like to work remotely. In addition the EOS 200D is NFC equipped and there’s the option to initiate an always-on low-energy Bluetooth link between camera and mobile device. Canon EOS 200D / SL2 – Build and design Canon has made quite a few changes from the 100D across the body, some of which are more obvious than others. One of the noticeable differences is the material used around the handgrip. The rubberised texture is smoother and not as grippy as it was on the EOS 100D. Personally, I liked the EOS 100D’s handgrip from a feel and handling perspective, however it never matched any other Canon DSLRs in this respect. The leatherette finish of the Canon EOS 200D’s grip doesn’t offer the same level of grip as its predecessor, but is more consistent with other models
        Canon produces and looks more stylish. The polycarbonate resin and carbon-and-glass-fibre body is adequately strong enough to shake off the occasional bump or knock it might receive in day-to-day use. Don’t expect it to be as robust as more expensive models in Canon’s range, though – pick up the EOS 77D or EOS 80D after handing the EOS 200D and you’ll immediately feel the difference in build quality. I have briefly touched on the fact that it’s a small camera, but its physical dimensions are very slightly larger than the EOS 100D’s. It measures 122.4×92.6x 69.8mm opposed to 116.8×90.7x69mm. I should also point out that it is smaller than Canon’s EOS 1300D and it’s a camera you’ll really want to get in your hands first to find out if it’s going to be the right choice for you. People with large hands are most likely to find the grip too small, but those with small hands won’t have any complaints. If you have medium-sized hands you may find your little finger has a tendency to drop off the bottom of the grip. Moving onto the layout of buttons and controls, it’s much the same as before with a few tweaks here and there. Live-view, playback and exposure-compensation buttons are all found in the same place, with the quick-menu button once again being located in the centre of a small D-pad. Just off to the right of the thumb rest are the AF point selection and exposure-lock buttons, which double up as zoom buttons in playback. The single scroll on the top plate is used to control aperture and shutter speed settings when shooting in the respective aperture priority or shutter priority modes. To adjust aperture with this dial when shooting in manual mode you’re required to press and hold the AV button at the rear, which soon becomes second nature after a while. Up on the top plate the on/off switch is now separated from the mode dial, making it slightly less awkward to operate with your thumb. Pushing the switch beyond its on/off settings engages video mode. The mode dial has been simplified and the PASM manual modes are clearly marked from the automatic modes. In front of the mode dial there is also a new display button beside the ISO button to switch the screen off when it’s not being used and preserve battery life. Both the ISO and DISP buttons are fairly spongy, though, and need to be depressed quite a way before they do anything. Ahead of these you get a knurled scroll dial and the shutter button, which is no longer surrounded by the same rubberised material as the EOS 100D’s handgrip. Those with sharp eyes will also notice a new connectivity button on the top of the camera to the left of the pop-up flash, which can be used to initiate a fast wireless connection. A small green LED blinks to tell you the cameras Wi-Fi is active, which turns constant when a successful connection has been made. The other button you get on the EOS 200D that you won’t find on the EOS 1300D is a depth-of-field preview button below the lens release. As for the build quality of the EF-S 18-55mm f/4-5.6 IS STM lens that comes with the camera as part of the basic kit, it’s about as good as one would expect for a kit lens that’s designed to get you started. It doesn’t have a metal mount and isn’t the retractable type, but its optical image stabiliser is effective at keeping handheld shots free of handshake and it doesn’t add much bulk to the camera. A silver version of the kit lens has also been produced and this is bundled with the all-white or vintage-inspired silver-and-tan finishes of the camera.'

      value: The Pentax KP is loaded with features, but does it do enough to stand out from the big guns in the enthusiast DSLR market? Michael Topham put it through its paces
    - type: conclusion
      value: The KP is an interesting proposition. It inherits many of the things we admired about the flagship Pentax K-1 and shrinks a number of its advanced features in a more compact body that’s built to the same robust, weather-sealed standards we associate with the brand. It shoots slightly faster and offers a greater number of AF points than the K-70, but doesn’t adopt everything from the K-3 II. The KP lacks a top-plate LCD, dual card slots, has a lower battery life and can’t shoot at 8.3fps. When you take this into account you realise the KP isn’t the most advanced APS-C DSLR going and sits off to one side of the K-3 II, presumably until its successor arrives. There is quite a lot to like about the KP. The dynamic range is excellent for this size of sensor, it’s not difficult to use despite having a plethora of buttons and dials, and the interchangeable grip design gives the user choice over the way the camera handles and feels with different lenses – something we rarely see. The KP’s standout feature though is its in-body stabilisation system. With a steady hand you can shoot sharp shots as slow as 1/5sec and stabilise the camera with any lens that’s attached. We have it to thank for the AA simulator, Pixel Shift Resolution, and automatic horizon correction modes too. Sadly, it’s not all good news, and the KP’s autofocus performance leaves quite a lot to be desired. While it’s fine for shooting static or slow-moving subjects, it has its work cut out keeping up with fast-paced action and struggles to offer the same responsiveness as its close rivals in Live View. If you regularly shoot sport, action or wildlife there are better options out there for less money. For those who’ve bought into the Pentax K-mount and want to advance from entry-level Pentax DSLRs, the KP serves up an attractive set of features, impressive image quality and excellent customisation in a convenient, if not slightly unusually styled body. It will satisfy some Pentax users, but at over £1,000 it struggles to offer the same value as some of its closest competitors at its current launch price.

      value: Pentax KP review – At a glance We often get asked questions about when a replacement model for a camera might be due. The truth is we’re no better informed than you, the AP reader, when it comes to knowing what products camera manufacturers are working on and when they might arrive. Researching the life cycle of a product is one way of getting a clue as to when we might expect a new model to emerge, but occasionally a new camera appears from nowhere without warning, completely out of the blue. One camera announcement that caught us slightly off guard in the first quarter of this year was the Pentax KP – a DSLR that presents a slightly different proposition from the two-year-old Pentax K-3 II. It inherits features from the full-frame Pentax K-1 as well as the mid-range K-70 and is out to target keen enthusiasts who are committed to photography and insist on advanced features in a solid, weather-resistant body. Its launch price and specification puts it the same league as popular models like the Canon EOS 80D and Nikon D7200, but unlike its rivals it presents many desirable features that these models don’t have. There’s no shortage of things to say about the KP, but it has a lot to do if it’s to tempt people away from the big-brand alternatives and be considered as a serious contender in its field. Pentax KP review – Features The KP incorporates a new-generation APS-C size CMOS image sensor with a 24.3-million-pixel resolution. By pairing this new sensor with the company’s latest PRIME IV imaging engine, the same processor as used within the flagship K-1, it has enabled the upper limit of the sensitivity range to reach new heights. The camera operates over a native sensitivity range of ISO 100-819,200, and by forgoing an optical anti-aliasing filter should match or exceed its competitors in terms of the level of detail it resolves. To minimise the risk of imaging artefacts such as aliasing, false colour and moiré, the KP is equipped with the same AA-filter simulator as found on the K-1 and K-70. This works with the in-body shake-reduction system to eliminate adverse effects by slightly blurring the image, emulating the role of a conventional anti-aliasing filter. Unlike its Canon and Nikon rivals, which both rely on in-lens stabilisation, the KP’s in-body image stabilisation is much more sophisticated and compensates for types of shake a photographer’s skills alone cannot correct. The Shake Reduction II (SR II) five-axis mechanism not only compensates for common camera shake caused by pitch and yaw, but also for blur caused by horizontal and vertical shift as well as that caused by roll, which is impossible to correct by lens-installed stabilisation systems. The other great benefit is that it can correct for shake with any lens, including fast primes and wideangle zooms that don’t often feature optical stabilisation. The benefit of the KP’s in-body IS system doesn’t end here either – it allows users to create super-high resolution images by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for four shots before synthesising them into a single composite image. In addition, the IS unit can make tiny rotational adjustments to the image sensor to compensate for skewed horizons when the Auto Horizon Correction function is enabled, and when the KP is used with the optional O-GPS1 GPS unit the camera can move the sensor to keep track of star movements during long-exposure shots of the night sky. Sensor and stabilisation aside, the KP offers a compelling set of additional features. Its SAFOX 11 AF sensor module has received an update to its autofocus algorithm that promises faster response, and you get a 27-point AF system that includes 25 cross-type points towards the centre that are sensitive to horizontal and vertical detail for greater accuracy. The working range of the AF system (-3EV-18EV) falls in line with its Canon and Nikon peers. The KP provides a choice of mechanical and electronic shutter modes. In electronic mode the shutter produces very little noise and vibration during shutter-curtain operation, making it ideal for shooting at locations where silence is required. Since this mode provides a top shutter speed of 1/24,000sec – considerably higher than the mechanical shutter’s 1/6,000sec limit, it also comes in handy when you’d like to use a wide aperture in bright, sunny conditions. It’s worth noting that the shake reduction (SR) mechanism and the AA filter simulator are inoperable in the electronic shutter mode. Keeping on the subject of speed, the KP reaches a top speed of 7fps like the Canon EOS 80D, but also lets you choose from two slower frame rates (0.8fps and 3fps). As is expected on a camera of the KP’s pedigree you get a whole array of features, such as in-camera raw conversion, digital filters, button customisation and live view capture tools that includes a new extract edge function that emphasises the focused section of a subject’s outline for speedy manual-focus operation. At the rear
        there’s a large, bright pentaprism viewfinder offering 0.95x magnification and 100% coverage, while just below it you’ll find a 3:2 aspect ratio 3in, 921k-dot tiltable LCD monitor. Those interested in movie recording will find that the KR can capture full HD footage at 60i/50i/30p/25p/24p and it has a 3.5mm port for attaching an external microphone. It enables the use of continuous AF (AF.C), the shake reduction (SR) mechanism and image-capture tools whilst recording video, but the lack of a touchscreen means that it can’t offer features such as touch focus. To be expected, the KP incorporates a Wi-Fi module to support wireless operations between the camera and smartphones or tablets. You do need to download the free Image Sync app that’s available for iOS and Android first, but once done you can browse captured images, transmit them to your mobile device or remotely control camera operations such as exposure and focus, in addition to the shutter release. Pentax KP review – Build and handling You’ll notice the KP has a different look from previous Pentax DSLRs and has been designed to be more compact and less cumbersome than the K-3 II. To make sure it conforms to what the majority of users want, a camera that’s small, light and convenient to carry, Pentax has rethought the layout of buttons and dials to make the best use of available space. The first thing you notice at the front is the vertically mounted front control dial that’s found next to the AF assist beam. This may look slightly peculiar and doesn’t do much for the overall aesthetics, but it’s comfortable to use and offers good feedback when you’re adjusting shutter speed or cycling through images in playback mode. The top-plate looks incredibly busy with its three dials and on/off switch. The mode dial is located hard up against the left edge of the viewfinder, and on the opposite side the KP inherits the function dial and setting dial from the K-1, which Pentax calls its ‘Smart Function’. The idea is that it takes away some of the hassle of finding what you need quickly from the main menu. Although it doesn’t offer a quick access to ten functions like the K-1, it does allow you to cycle through the KP’s metering modes, HDR capture modes and continuous shooting modes, with the option of assigning your most frequently used functions to three custom positions (C1 to C3). This is just one area where the KP offers excellent customisation. In addition, there are five user mode settings, to each of which you can assign a selection of desired functions. There are also three customisable Fx buttons across the body, you can adapt the function of the AF/AE-L button, and you can even assign a different set of functions to the front and rear command dials for each exposure mode if you wish. The customisation possibilities are endless. Something rather unusual about the KP is the way it allows you to tune the feel of the camera to your personal taste by unscrewing the grip and replacing it with another. There’s no such thing as ‘one size fits all’ when it comes to the way a camera fits and feels in an individual’s hand, so it’s good to see Pentax trying to cater for everyone by offering interchangeable handgrips. There’s a large grip to accommodate heavy lenses, a medium grip that doesn’t protrude quite as far from the body and a small grip for those who’d like to keep it small when travelling or using it with lightweight primes. I started by using the KP with smallest grip, which is adequate for casual shooting. When you attach slightly heavier and longer lenses you want a bit more to wrap your hand around and this is where the medium-size grip comes in. This offered better balance and stability with the supplied Pentax 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 ED DC WR HD DA lens. Replacing the medium grip for the large grip using the Allen key provided took less than 20 seconds and will be the preferred choice for those with medium to large sized hands. It’s convenient having the option to change the grip to a larger one or vice versa, particularly if the camera is going to be shared between two people with different sized hands. Each grip secured tightly and didn’t creak when squeezed. Out of the three, the largest handgrip was my favourite and became my go-to option. The body of the KP is made from magnesium alloy and has no fewer than 67 weather seals to prevent intrusion of water and dust. Those who’d like to extend their shooting sessions between battery changes will be pleased to hear the optional D-BG7 battery grip is built to the same weather-resistant standard. During testing I used the KP in an almighty downpour and experienced no issues or problems with performance. Pentax has built up an excellent reputation for making extremely robust DSLRs and I’m glad to report the KP continues this trend. The way it has been built to such solid standards gives you confidence that the camera will offer good service over a number of years. One criticism of its build is that the
        shutter button feels too spongy for my liking and doesn’t offer the level of feedback I expect when it is half depressed. Pentax KP review – Autofocus Pentax DSLRs have picked up some negative criticism in the past for lagging behind their peers with regard to their autofocus performance, so how does the KP fare? The SAFOX 11 AF system it uses isn’t as advanced as the SAFOX 12 system you’ll find in the Pentax K-1, but does benefit from a new AF algorithm that’s been fine-tuned in an attempt to improve autofocus speed. You’re provided with 27 phase-detect points in total and of these, 25 are the cross-type variety. The two remaining linear AF sensor points are positioned either side. The central point, including those directly above and below it, are sensitive to f/2.8 and work in light as low as -3EV. In use, I found the central 5×5 arrangement of central AF points sensitive enough to bring subjects into focus in a respectable time when shooting in bright conditions, but when the light levels drop you notice it takes longer for it to go about its business of acquiring focus and this is where the green AF assist beam can come into its own. It manages to track slow-moving subjects in its continuous focus (AF-C) mode provided you’re able to keep the central area of the frame over your subject; just don’t expect the same success rate as you’d get on a DSLR that’s built for speed and action like the Nikon D500 or Canon EOS 7D Mark II. As we’ve mentioned before on other Pentax models, one distinct failing is the red targets that indicate the active AF area in the viewfinder. Not only are they tiny, they’re difficult to see in high-contrast conditions. On more than one occasion I found myself repositioning the AF point back to the centre simply because the off-centre position of the AF point wasn’t immediately obvious. Switching between AF modes is simple enough – simply hold the AF mode button and use the rear command dial to scroll between Auto (27 points), Zone Select (nine points), Select (a user-selected single point), or Spot (the centre point). There’s also a select-area expansion mode for those who’d like to track a moving subject and let the camera follow the movement whilst automatically refocusing on it with the help of neighbouring points. The performance of Autofocus in Live View is a similar affair to the Pentax K-70. It’s rather clunky, feels sluggish and has nothing on its mirrorless competitors or Canon DSLRs that boast Dual Pixel AF and deliver impressive continuous autofocus in Live View. The viewfinder on the KP is really rather good and it’s great to know that what you see is what the sensor records thanks to its 100% field of view. The shooting settings don’t rotate in portrait mode like they do on many mirrorless cameras, but there is the option to swap the exposure scale for a sensitive electronic level to prevent shots being taken askew without taking your eye off the subject. Pentax KP review – Performance Use the camera set to its auto white balance setting and you can expect results to be more on the cool side than they are warm. Some may prefer this feel, but I got into the habit of warming my shots up a touch using the temperature slider in Lightroom. The 86,000-pixel RGB light-metering sensor delivers acceptable exposures, but I did occasionally apply +0.3EV or +-0.7EV of correction to prevent my images appearing a fraction underexposed. The HDR mode can be used to produce natural-looking shots when the bracketing value is kept below +2EV. The fact that the KP lacks a top-plate LCD means you’re dependent on the screen and viewfinder when it comes to glancing at your camera settings. Though the KP’s screen is a little behind the times in terms of its resolution, the colourful info display with its large font makes it easy to read exposure settings. The main menu isn’t overly convoluted or difficult to navigate, but you get the impression it could be made more intuitive if it supported touch functionality. If I had to sum up the KP’s performance in one word I would say it is satisfactory. It delivers acceptable results that you’re unlikely to be disappointed with, but you can’t help but feel it’s not as refined or as well-polished as some of the competition. Pentax KP review – Pixel shift resolution The Pentax KP features the same Pixel Shift Resolution system that we’ve seen previously on the K-3 II, K-70 and full-frame K-1. In almost all cameras, the light-sensitive pixels capture red, green or blue light, and a full-colour image is built up using a clever process of interpolation between them. But this can give rise to softness and artefacts when examining images closely at the pixel level. The Pentax KP’s Pixel Shift Resolution mode captures four images of the same scene by shifting the image sensor by a single pixel for each image, then combines this information into a single composite image. By obtaining colour information in each pixel, the KP can deliver higher-resolution
        images that assure true-to-life colour reproduction. The camera has to be locked off on a tripod for it to work and you’re provided with a motion-correction setting that takes into account subjects that move between the exposures. In practice, the system works well. Images taken in Pixel Shift Resolution mode show visibly finer detail as illustrated below and the motion-correction setting dramatically reduces image artefacts on moving leaves or water, although it doesn’t quite eliminate them. Because of this, it’s best used for static subjects such as still life or architecture. Pentax KP review – Dynamic range, resolution & noise Our lab tests tell us the KP resolves the level of detail we’d expect from a 24-million-pixel sensor without an optical aliasing filter and you can confidently use the camera at up to ISO 6400 without too much concern. You’d get away with pushing to ISO 25,600 in an emergency, but the headline-grabbing ISO 819,200 should be steered well clear of. Raw shooters will appreciate that it records in Adobe’s DNG format, which means that unlike other new models, you shouldn’t need to update your software to handle its files. Dynamic range At ISO 100, the KP’s dynamic range result measures 12.7EV – a figure that’s higher than the 12.3EV we previously recorded on the Pentax K-70, but not quite as high as the Pentax K-1 that records 13.8EV at the same sensitivity. It manages to stay above 12EV until ISO 800, after which it drops down to a still respectable 11.4EV at ISO 1600. Results at ISO 3200, 6400 and 12,800 drop to 10.4EV, 9.3EV and 8.1EV respectively, with shadowed areas gradually getting noisier as you push towards ISO 25,600. It’s highly impressive to see the KP recording figures above 6EV right up to ISO 51,200. Resolution The results above show the level of detail the KP resolves by shooting in raw with the pixel-shift resolution mode and AA Filter Simulator switched off. The sensor can resolve 3,600l/ph at ISO 100 just like the Pentax K-70, but traces of moiré and false colour are suppressed heavily by JPEG processing, leading to a noticeable drop in resolution. To resolve the finest detail, shooting in the raw format is imperative. Push past ISO 25,600 and the detail deteriorates quickly, with the highest settings being too poor to be worth illustrating here. Noise Both raw and JPEG images taken from our diorama scene are captured at the full range of ISO settings. The camera is placed in its default setting for JPEG images. Raw images are sharpened and noise reduction applied, to strike the best balance between resolution and noise. At low ISO sensitivities, the KP’s image quality is excellent; fine detail is rendered in its raw files thanks to the lack of an optical low-pass filter, and there’s no visible noise between ISO 100 and 800. Luminance noise does start to appear at ISO 1600 but it’s by no means detrimental and you can create usable results at ISO 3200 and ISO 6400 by applying a little noise reduction. If a shooting situation forces you to go higher than ISO 6400, pushing the KP to ISO 25,600 isn’t out of the question but should be seen as the upper limit you’ll want to push it to in an emergency. Saturation takes a hit at ISO 51,200. At ISO 204,800 you can just about make out the outlines of a subject but at ISO 409,600 images suffer so severely from noise you’re not quite sure what you’re looking at.

    - type: conclusion
      value: From the moment I first used the Canon EOS 7D Mark II following its launch in September 2014, I thought it was a brilliant camera. With the exception of Wi-Fi connectivity, it had just about every feature I wanted in a tough, weatherproof body. Its blistering 10fps shooting rate is perfect for shooting sport and its 65-point AF system is fast and accurate. And although some find its customisation options confusing, these can be extremely useful. The evaluative metering system is also good, balancing the brightness of the scene well in most situations. The fact that the 7D Mark II’s specification compares so well with that of the Nikon D500 is a mark of how far ahead of the game it was at the time it was announced. However, there are little tell-tale signs of its age now. For example, the D500 doesn’t make huge use of its touchscreen functionality, but it makes reviewing images much more intuitive. I know it’s only using swipes and screen taps instead of pressing buttons, but I somehow feel more immersed in the images. It would be nice if Nikon could add an on-screen rating button to tag images before they are downloaded though. Compared to the EOS 7D Mark II’s fixed screen, the D500’s tilting screen is also very useful. A vari-angle screen would be even better, helping with low-angle upright shots. Nevertheless, the tilting screen is good for low or high-level, landscape-format images and it’s a godsend for videographers. Speaking of which, video enthusiasts are likely to be drawn by the D500’s 4K capability. However, its live view and video AF system are nowhere near as good as the 7D Mark II’s. Seasoned filmmakers will be used to shooting with manual focus anyway, but it’s disappointing that Nikon hasn’t progressed its DSLRs’ live view AF system to include phase-detection focusing. Nikon’s SnapBridge system makes sharing images a real breeze. I love how the D500 can send images automatically to my phone.Although there are a couple of handling niggles with the D500, its speedy focusing and superb detail make it a really great camera and a worthy winner of this duel. Just don’t get too excited about those uppermost sensitivity expansion settings.

      value: "Canon EOS 7D Mark II vs Nikon D500: Introduction Prior to the D500, the last Nikon APS-C-format DSLR that could really be regarded as \La high-end enthusiast or semi-professional level model was the D300s . This was announced back in July 2009, when Nikon was firmly wedded to the belief that 12 million pixels was enough. What’s more, the D300S was a relatively modest upgrade to the D300, which dated from two years earlier. While both were great cameras in their day, time and technology marches on, and in 2010, Nikon began to introduce DSLRs such as the D7000 , which sat below the D300S but had higher pixel counts. Nikon enthusiasts began \Lto rub their hands together anticipating a new model that most expected to be called the D400. However, such a camera conspicuously failed to appear, and in its absence many potential buyers began to consider the 24MP D7100 introduced in 2013 and the full-frame D600 from 2012. Again, they were both good cameras but neither quite matched the D300S for build, shooting speed and burst depth. When Canon introduced the EOS 7D Mark II in September 2014, Nikon users could only look enviously at its specification, which was aimed specifically at serious enthusiasts and semi-pro photographers wanting an all-rounder that was fast enough to shoot sport at a high level. This situation continued until January this year when – just when many users had stopped believing it would happen – Nikon introduced a new top-flight APS-C-format DSLR, skipping the D400 moniker in favour of the D500. As the D500’s natural competitor is the Canon EOS 7D Mark II, we’re pitching the two together head-to-head to find out if the older Canon favourite can live up to the challenge from Nikon’s young buck. Why go for APS-C format? At one time, APS-C-format DSLRs were the only real choice for most enthusiasts because full-frame models were so expensive. Today, however, both Canon and Nikon offer much more affordable full-frame models. So why do so many photographers want a high-end APS-C-format camera? You only have to compare the specification of the Nikon D500 with the pro D5 to see the most convincing argument – price. The sensor inside a full-frame camera is its most expensive component and using a smaller unit cuts the cost considerably, even if, as in the case of the D5 and D500, most of the rest of the technology is the same. Another persuasive reason is that many photographers have built up a collection of compatible lenses. Although in Nikon’s case these DX optics can be used on a full-frame (FX) body, there seems little point if you’re only going to use an APS-C-sized section of the sensor most of the time anyway. Upgrading to full-frame lenses incurs significant additional cost. In the early days of digital SLRs, the focal length magnification brought by an APS-C-format camera was a disadvantage because very few wideangle lenses were available. Today that position has changed significantly, and wideangle photography can be enjoyed by owners of both types of camera. However, APS-C-format users have the advantage of a little extra ‘reach’ from their telephoto optics, which means they can frame distant subjects tighter and avoid post-capture cropping. It’s particularly useful when shooting sport or wildlife – key areas for the target audience of the EOS 7D Mark II and D500. One argument that doesn’t hold quite so well today is the difference in size. Stepping down from a full-frame DSLR to an APS-C-format model does result in a reduction in size, but there are far smaller compact system cameras available. Canon EOS 7D Mark II vs Nikon D500: Features Canon EOS 7D Mark II: Features Inside the Canon EOS 7D Mark II is a 20.2MP APS-C- format sensor, which unlike the D500’s has an optical low pass filter (OLPF). This should ensure moiré patterning is kept at bay, but it could mean it’s less able to capture really fine detail. However, its Dual Pixel CMOS technology enables much-improved AF in live view and video mode. The sensor is coupled with a DIGIC 6 processing engine, and together, they enable a maximum continuous shooting rate of 10 frames per second (fps) for up to 31 raw files when a UDMA 7 CompactFlash card is used. This burst depth can be extended to 1,030 JPEGs if you can do without raw files. When it was introduced the 7D Mark II had the highest native sensitivity setting of any Canon DSLR, (ISO 16,000), but that and the highest expansion setting (ISO 51,200) seem low in comparison to the D500’s native maximum of ISO 51,200 and uppermost expansion setting of ISO 1,640,000. Nevertheless, the low-light capability, fast frame rate and high-specification AF system (which will be covered later on) make the 7D Mark II a great choice for enthusiasts who want to get serious about shooting sport, action and wildlife. As its LCD dates back to before the time when Canon really embraced touch-control, there’s no point in tapping on the (fixed) 3in 1.04-million-dot screen. But most experienced Canon\
        \ users will find they quickly get to grips with the camera’s operation. On the back there’s a sprung selection lever around the multi-controller. This acts as a controller for the main dial on the top-plate, enabling it to be used to adjust a setting selected via the Customisation menu. I prefer to use it to allow me to change sensitivity quickly, but it can also be used to set the AF point, AF point-selection mode, AE lock, AE lock hold, switch to a registered AF point or access exposure compensation. Meanwhile, I like to use the multi-controller to adjust the AF point directly. Helpfully, in shooting mode the creative photo button provides a quick route to the picture style, multiple exposure and HDR options. In review mode it allows you to compare two images side-by-side for rating using the Rate button. It’s a really useful way of spending ‘downtime’ between shots because the ratings allow you to find your best images quickly once they are downloaded. Nikon D500: Features With 20.9 million effective pixels on its CMOS sensor, the Nikon D500 has a slightly higher resolution than the 7D Mark II that’s hardly worth mentioning, save for the fact there’s also no low-pass filter that could also give it a slight edge for recording detail. And as mentioned earlier, there’s a phenomenal sensitivity range topping out at the equivalent of ISO 1,640,000 made possible by the new sensor and Expeed 5 processing engine. However, the top ISO settings give poor quality. Like the 7D Mark II, the D500 can shoot at a maximum continuous rate of 10 frames per second for up to 200 14-bit lossless compressed raw files. This therefore enables more of the action to be recorded in one blast of raw files, giving greater scope for adjustment post-capture. Unlike the 7D Mark II, the D500 has a tilting screen that’s touch-sensitive. Measuring 3.2in across the diagonal and with 2.359 million dots, it’s bigger and more detailed than the 7D Mark II’s. That’s not to say the Canon screen is bad – far from it – but the D500 shows just a little more detail, while the tilting mechanism is especially useful for anyone making use of the 4K video capability. Disappointingly, Nikon has restricted the use of the touchscreen to setting the AF point in live view and video mode, scrolling through images with a swipe and double-tapping to zoom in to check sharpness. It would be nice to be able to navigate the menu and make setting selections with it as well, but it’s not possible. Using the two cameras interchangeably, it doesn’t take long before you start to become a little frustrated by the comparative slowness of the 7D Mark II. The D500 just seems a little more responsive, and unlike the 7D Mark II there’s no need to press the shutter release to activate the AF system before you can move the AF point; instead, just nudging the Nikon controller is enough. And if you want to move the point right across the frame you just need to push and hold the controller across instead of the nudge-and-release, nudge-and-release action that is required by the Canon camera. One irritation with the D500, however, is that the options revealed by pressing the i-button seem rather random, and it can’t be customised. In addition, the information screen activated by pressing the Info-button isn’t interactive. Canon EOS 7D Mark II: Dynamic range, resolution and noise Dynamic range Our Applied Imaging tests reveal a high dynamic range at the lower sensitivity settings, but it starts to fall more noticeably from above ISO 400. The decline is steady and although the 7D Mark II is second to the D500 at the lower settings, at ISO 6,400 the roles are reversed. The differences are slight, but Canon has managed to maintain dynamic range just a little better at the high ISOs. Resolution Thanks to its 20.2MP sensor the 7D Mark II can record around 3,000l/ph from ISO 100 up to around 800. Naturally some fall-off starts above this, but detail levels are maintained well up to around ISO 16,000, where our tests still register 2,800 l/ph. Above this we’re into the expansion settings and there’s a sharper decline to around 2,000l/ph at ISO 51,200. Noise is also controlled well up to ISO 6,400. Noise At low sensitivity values the 7D Mark II produces very attractive images with pleasantly saturated, slightly warm JPEG colours in the default settings. Noise is controlled very well, but if you can, it’s definitely best to keep to ISO 6,400 or lower. ISO 25,600 is a step too far for most situations and even ISO 12,800 for some. Colours stand up well, but darker tones start to become mushy and lacking in detail. Nikon D500: Dynamic range, resolution and noise Dynamic range At the lower sensitivity settings the D500 achieves very impressive scores in our Applied Imaging tests; in fact its dynamic range doesn’t drop below 12EV until the sensitivity is over ISO 800. However, at ISO 6,400 and over, it drops just below the performance of the 7D Mark II, diving below 6EV above ISO 51,200. High-sensitivity\
        \ images require much more careful handling during processing than lower-resolution shots. Resolution From the lowest sensitivity values, up to and including ISO 3,200, the D500 captures an impressively high level of detail, and it beats the 7D Mark II throughout its range. It particularly impresses at ISO 50-400, scoring 3,400l/ph in JPEG files and almost 3,800l/ph in raw files. However, at ISO 204,800 the results look very poor with a green cast of noise becoming visible. Noise Noise is controlled well in images shot within the D500’s native sensitivity range (ISO 100-51,200), but, ignoring the slight difference in sharpness/details, there isn’t all that much of a difference between its images and those from the 7D Mark II at the same settings. The results at ISO 204,800 are poor, but at the top three extended settings (ISO 409,600, ISO 819,200 and ISO 1,640,000) they are diabolical. Canon EOS 7D Mark II and Nikon D500: Autofocus Both cameras are billed as being for serious use, and with sport/action photography being high on the agenda they have high-specification autofocusing systems. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II has a 65-point system with all the points being cross-type and individually selectable. For extra sensitivity, the centre point is dual-cross type when lenses with a maximum aperture of f/2.8 or larger are used. With lenses or lens and teleconverter combinations that have maximum apertures between f/2.8 and f/8 this point is cross-type. Meanwhile the Nikon D500 has a total of 153 AF points, of which 99 are cross-type. However, only 55 of them are actually available for selection by the photographer. The other 98 points are support points that the camera can choose to use if it needs to – they help with tracking moving subjects. Of the 153 points, 15 are capable of functioning with maximum apertures as small as f/8, giving teleconverter users more chances of getting the subject sharp and the camera keeping it that way. Nikon scores another point from Canon as its AF system is claimed to be sensitive down to -4EV, 1 EV lower than Canon’s, indicating that the D500 is better able to cope with low light. Each camera has a collection of AF point selection modes that are designed to help you hit a moving target, whether it’s travelling along a predictable path or shifting erratically. In the default settings the D500 makes these options easier to select because the 7D Mark II’s M-Fn button can be hard to locate when you’re looking through the viewfinder. However, the customisable selection lever can be used instead. Autofocus settings Like the EOS 5D Mark III and EOS-1D X before it, the 7D Mark II has a dedicated autofocus section in the menu with a key page giving control over tracking sensitivity, acceleration and deceleration tracking and AF point switching. Their aim is to enable you to tailor the system’s response in AI Servo AF (continuous autofocus) mode to suit the circumstances. Their use is aided by a series of Case Studies, but despite the sporty icons, some photographers can find the descriptions rather confusing, so it’s important to read them carefully to select the best option for any given subject. The D500 offers similar controls under menu option a3 (focus tracking with lock-on) and although the screen looks less impressive, the two controls are easier to understand. ‘Blocked shot AF response’ determines the speed at which the camera reacts to a change in subject distance while ‘subject motion’ allows you to specify whether the subject is moving erratically or steadily (or half-way between). The two autofocus systems perform very well in the field, getting moving subjects sharp and tracking them accurately in most situations. However, when comparable lenses are used, the D500’s AF system is just a little quicker, and I find I get a higher hit rate using it.
